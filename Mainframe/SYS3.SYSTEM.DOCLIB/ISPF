There are two types of changes which have been made to create the
in-use ISPF contatenations.  First, all sysres datasets were merged
into the SYS1.ISPF.SYS.xxx libraries and the originals deleted, with
SMP/E DDDEFs updated to point to the replacements.  Second, all
program product libraries are *copied* into the SYS3.ISPF.PPS.xxx
libraries, retaining the originals.  This means that the TSO logon
procs do not need to be changed each time a new product is installed.
The original program libraries must be retained so that when a product
is replaced or deleted, it can be determined which members in the
merged libraries need to be deleted.
