To create a new sysres for SYSB from SYSA's current sysres:

- Determine which MVSBRn volume is to be used.
- Vary it offline on SYSB.
- In GG$LDW.JCL.CNTL(SYSBCPYA), change all 'MVSBR?' to the selected
  volume.
- Run the job; do NOT save the edited JCL.
- Edit and run GG$LDW.RLG.CNTL(MVSCP), as per instructions in
  SYS3.SYSTEM.DOCLIB(SYSBGEN) .
- In the latest GG$MVS.AMDAHL.COMET.Lyymm.INSTALL, insure that job
  SMPECOMA has been run, specifying PRDRLSE=MDS 1.0 .
- Edit member SMPLIST to remove the sysmod for ERBMFIQA which as of June
  1996 is no longer required, says Bill Nunn.
- In jobs SMPEREC, SMPEAPCK, SMPEAPP, do the following:
  - Fix JOB statement.
  - Copy in member SMPLIST after the SELECT( .
  - Change SMPEPROC to IPOSMPE.  Remove stepname qualifier
    from SMPCNTL dd statement.
- In SMPEREC, if the SYSMODS dataset was loaded to disk, change the
  SMPPTFIN to point to it.
- Run job SMPEREC.
- Run job SMPEAPCK.
- In job SMPEAPP, insert overrides for all libraries which will be
  written to based on the SMPRPT from the apply check.  Currently,
  these are LINKLIB and NUCLEUS.  The overrides should point to the
  libraries of the same names on the MVSBRn volume selected in the
  first step.
- Run job SMPEAPP.
