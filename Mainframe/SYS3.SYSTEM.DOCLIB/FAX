Original is WYL.GG.JWS.MAINT#FAX                           09/23/97

Fax processing on armstrong is done by the faxspooler program, started
in /etc/rc.local.  It keeps 3 log files:

    /systems/adm/faxtrace  - very verbose
    /systems/adm/faxlog    - less verbose
    /systems/adm/faxtxd    - terse

The fax queue is in /systems/spool/fax.  Each queued fax has a '.qf'
file plus some other files.  The '.qf' file gives info about the
sender and the phone number.  All of the files for a fax will have
the same file name prefix.  You can delete a fax by rm'ing all of
the files for it (or you can keep a fax from being processed by
renaming the '.qf' file to something like '.qf.bad').  If you do this
while the faxspooler program is trying to send the fax it may get
upset or may hang.  In this case just kill it and restart it (see
the startup command in /etc/rc.local).

Fax source is in /systems/local/src/netfax...this is a SunOS program
and probably won't comile under Solaris 2.

Netfax programs and files are /usr/local/bin/fax and
/usr/local/netfax/*

The fax phone line number is 723-1061.  The jack is in one of the
Sun cabinets.  The fax modem is the Zyxel modem connected to armstrong.
If the modem fails there is an Everex modem in the machine room
spare equipment cabinets that can be swapped in to replace the Zyxel.

The NETFAX job running on SYSA takes fax jobs from the JES2
queue and sends them to armstrong (by doing rsh /usr/local/bin/fax).

The Wylbur FAX command is an exec (WYL.GS.NET.FAX#FAX).  It
uses a phone prefix public record group that is loaded by
WYL.GS.WYL.PARMS#FAXLOAD.  The related files are

    WYL.GS.WYL.PHONES.INPUT - original data, from Comm Services
    WYL.GS.WYL.PHONES.LOCAL - the phone table ready to load

Comm services (normally Fred Hansson) sends me a new version of the
PHONES.INPUT every few months.  To install this file, replace the
current PHONES.INPUT file and edit the file to look like the
PHONES.LOCAL file.  This used to be automated, but the format of the
input file has changed and a new conversion exec is needed.  If the
result looks OK, save it as the new PHONES.LOCAL data set.  This
table tells the fax software what phone prefixes are in the local
calling area and don't need an authorization code.

The FAX command is also installed on SYSB, and has its own copy of the
PHONES.LOCAL file.

There is a binder labeled FAX in my bookshelf that contains listings
and other info.
