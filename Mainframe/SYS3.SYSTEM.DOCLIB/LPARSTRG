The normal memory allocation for the LPARS on Forsythe is
as follows:

              SYSA       SYSD        SYSE         SYSH

CS Initial    868M       200M        200M         200M

ES Initial    320M       64M         64M          64M


Memory can be reallocated to give SYSD all available test LPAR
memory.  Note that even inactive LPARs must be assigned a
minimum 4M of CS.


             SYSA        SYSD        SYSE          SYSH

CS Initial   868M        720M        4M            4M

ES Initial   320M        64M
