JOBGEN is the name of a process run each night.  It is a set of
jobs that begins with a GG.PRD.PRD#A (PRD#A) job submitted by
the Auto-Submit process.  PRD#A is a simple job that sends the
PRDGENA member of  WYL.GG.PRD.JOBGEN  to the internal reader.

PRDGENA contains two jobs, PRDGEN#A and PRDRUN#A

PRDGEN#A reads through the SPIRES FILEDEF subfile looking at
the DEFQ of each defined file.  If the DEFQ isn't empty, and
the NOJOBGEN and/or NOAUTOGEN flags are not set in the DEFQ,
then JOBGEN copies the DEFQ to a disk dataset, and creates
the JCL necessary to perform a SPIBILD against the file.

When the JOBGEN step is completed, PRDRUN#A is released to
send the jobs through the internal reader.  PRDGEN#A also
submits a job to copy the dumped DEFQs to tape, a job to
copy the JOBGEN output to a GDG, and a SAQAFILE job to deal
with security checking.

Because PRDGEN#A can fail at any point, a backup job is sent
to the internal reader, and purged if PREGEN#A completes.
If PRDGEN#A doesn't complete normally, this backup job tries
again, this time dumping DEFQ's directly to tape.
