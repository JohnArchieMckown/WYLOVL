To open a new account on Forsythe, follow these steps:

1. PRISM//SEL COMPUTER ACCOUNTS

2. If you need to model a new account after an existing account, you
   will want to first FIND(F3) the existing account and make note of
   Univ. Acct. Number, Source of Funds codes, sponsor name, etc.

3. Next type ENTRY(F8) and enter your PIN when requested.

4. Next type CREATE(F6) and fill in the form.

5. When done, type SEND(F6)

After the sponsor approves, the form gets routed to Account Services.
The request to open a new account will be acted on usually during the
next business day.

The most difficult part of this process is making sure that the
sponsor you name has signature authority for the University Account
Number you assign.  Currently (12/12/95) Ron Meyer has signature
authority for ORRR020, so that can be used to open a new account.
If it needs to be adjusted, that can be done via a note to Account
Services after the account is open.

It is a good idea to email the Manager of Systems to let him/her
know what you have done so that if anything needs to change, he/she
can adjust as needed.
