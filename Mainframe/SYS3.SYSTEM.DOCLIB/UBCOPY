UBCOPY:  program to correct unblocked records
Author:  Mark C. Lawrence
Revised: 1995/08/03


CATFIX catalogs and recatalogs data sets on disk or tape.  The action
taken for each data set depends on the options.  In general, the goal
UBCOPY is a utility to copy unblocked datasets (either sequential or direct)
using full-track reads, and creating a blocked sequential dataset as output.
If the input file has keys, they are included in the output records.

Following is sample JCL, in this case to copy the TLMS Master File:

//   JOB
// EXEC PGM=UBCOPY
//STEPLIB DD DSN=SYS4.APF.PROD.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
//INPUT DD DSN=SYS2.TLMSMSTR,DISP=SHR
//OUTPUT DD UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(400,100),RLSE),DISP=(,CATLG),
// DSN=WYL.GA.MCL.TLMSDATA,DCB=BLKSIZE=23400

Output RECFM is always FB; LRECL is input record size plus key length.
Specified BLKSIZE will be rounded to a multiple of LRECL.
