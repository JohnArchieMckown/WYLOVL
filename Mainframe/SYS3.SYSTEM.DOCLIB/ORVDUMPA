                          ORVYL File Dumps - SYSA


<.u+>ORVYL dump process<.u->

The dumps are staged automatically each night by ZEKE  which
contains all the scheduling criteria for each file system dump.
There is a job called ORVSETV which runs every night after midnight
and sets the scheduling variables for all the file systems (start time,
tape drive allocation, etc.).  The jcl for the jobs that run can
be found in WYL.GS.ORV.ZEKELIB.

There are three types of ORVYL file dumps:  FULL, a complete dump
of an entire file system; DAILY INCREMENTAL, an incremental dump
of only blocks changed since the last incremental dump. The tape
portion of the incremental dumps is a separate job called
xxx2TAPE where 'xxx' is the first 3 digits of the file system name.


<.u+>Researching the status of a SYSA  ORVYL dump<.u->

The root for all investigations related to ORVYL file dumps is in
the data set one of the following data sets:

         WYL.GG.ORV.ALPHA.STREAM on SYSA

The member MPINIT normally defines the file systems for that version
of ORVYL.  Check the //PARMS dd statement in the ORVYL proc to
verify that this is indeed the current init member.

For each ORVYL file system, there is a definition in the init member
which describes the file system and which specifies via the INCLUDE=
parameter the name of the member which describes the data sets
which make up that file system.

To check the status of an ORVYL file system dump, run the following
job:

         //ORVLIST  JOB ,TIME=(,15)
         //LIST    EXEC PGM=FILEDUMP,PARM=LIST
         //STEPLIB  DD  DSN=WYL.GG.ORV.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR
         //CONTROL  DD  DSN=WYL.GG.ORV.ALPHA.STREAM(member),DISP=SHR

where <member> specifies the individual file system data set
description.

This job will list the contents of the dump history file for that
file system.

The SYSA jobs run under the account GS.ORV; look for them under
that account.


<.u+>Recovery from a dump failure<.u->

To recover from a failure of a full dump on any file system,
just resubmit the dump.  On SYSA, issue the command:

         ORVDUMP xxxDUMP    where 'xxx is the file system name.

The command you type is dependent upon the type of dump you
want to rerun.

To recover from a failure of an incremental dump on SYSA
just resubmit the dump with the command:

         ORVDUMP XXXINC   where 'xxx' is the file system name.

To run a VERIFY on a file system, type in the command:

         ORVDUMP xxxVRFY   where 'xxx' is the file system name.


Temporary data sets for changed blocks have names of the following
form on SYSA:

         WYL.GS.ORV.filesys.X.Dddddd.Ttttttt.P0n


If the resubmitted job needs more space, scratch these data sets on
the DMPA packs before rerunning the job.

Valid parms for the FILEDUMP program are:

     LIST - list the history file this file system
     DUMP - do a full dump for this file system
     INCREMENTAL - do an incremental dump for this file system
     OFFLOAD - merge the incremental on disk with last tape to
               get a new incremental tape (especially for BOOKS
               dump set).



ORVYL dump failure FYI's:

Rerunning offload to tape:

If the xxx2TAPE portion of the incremental dump fails but has
already written the INCIXR portion off to tape but left the
incremental data on DMPA packs, you can use the jcl for that
file system's tape job (found in WYL.GS.ORV.ZEKELIB#xxx2TAPE),
delete the SYSUT1 and SYSUT2 dd statements and run the job.
Once the job completes (expect OFFGEN=0 but GETIXR=12),
the DMPA volume will be cleaned of any datasets.


ORVYL dump failures - User=1234 abend code:

If a dump fails with the above user code, check to make sure all
the volumes allocated to that file system are allocated and online.
If any of them are allocated and pending offline, the dump will
fail at the volume that is pending offline.  To resolve, place the
volume address back online, resubmit if possible, or wait till
the following resubmission the next day.   Remember to clear off
any residual data left behind on the DMPA volume from the dump
process otherwise the dump will fail again.
