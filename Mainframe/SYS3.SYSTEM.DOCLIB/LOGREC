             Where to find LOGREC info, how to support


Jobs to setup, run, and repair LOGREC data are kept in the library
WYL.GR.OTS.LOGREC.

In addition, this library contains a list of the currently assigned
SSIDs.  A set of these are assigned to each disk subsystem in the
complex, and a new entry should be made when a new disk subsystem is
installed.
