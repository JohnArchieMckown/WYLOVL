The Auto-Submit process is a batch job run under GG.SUB that has
the ability to send other jobs to the internal reader.  These jobs
are kept in a SPIRES file called GG.SUB.SUBMIT, under the subfile
name of "SUBMIT JOBS".  Each night AUTOSUBP, the GG.SUB job, does
the following things:

1.  It resubmits itself through the internal reader with a JOBPARM
specifying: START=00:01,DATE=NEXT.  This new version will run on
the next day, one-minute past midnight.

2.  It then checks that it hasn't already run today.  It does that
by looking at the date the DEFQ was last reinitialized by SPIBILD.
If that was done "today", the job aborts.

3.  AUTOSUBP submits a RESETLOG job to the internal reader.  This
job will switch the current job log to old, and setup a new current.
See: WYL.GR.OPS.SYSA.SYSVLOG.CURRENT

4.  The SUBMIT file is processed by SPIBILD to flush the DEFQ.

5.  A Batch-SPIRES (JOBGEN) step then reads through SUBMIT JOBS
looking for candidates to be submitted today.  Any jobs found that
satisfy the criteria have their record updated to reflect today's
submission date.  This places each selected record in the DEFQ.

6.  The DEFQ is then sent to a dataset using a format that outputs
the JCL corresponding to each selected job (Dataset: AUTOSUB.SYSA)

7.  Another step scans the DEFQ and creates dataset JOBLIST.SYSA
containing a list of keys of the selected records (gg.uuu.jobname).

8.  Finally, the AUTOSUB.SYSA dataset to sent to the internal reader.

The AUTOSUBP member of WYL.GG.SUB.LIBSYSA contains the JCL.
Substitute SYSB or SYSD for SYSA on other platforms.
