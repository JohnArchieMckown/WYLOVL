MVS and SYStem volume usage:

3390-2's:   --- vague categories for contents ---
 SYSA01 - SYSA primary (mcat, racf backup, parmlib, plpa, common, etc)
          roughly the replacement for SYS200.
 SYSA02 - SYSD primary (racf backup)
 SYSA03 - SYSA primary (racf)
 SYSA04 - SYSD primary (racf, plpa, common)
 SYSA05 - misc (wylbur, milten, etc)
 SYSA06 - misc, primarly MVS SMP/E libraries
3390-3:
 SYSA11 - program products, mostly 4D stuff.  other large seldom-used
          datasets.
 SYSA12 - SMPPTS

Other program products are on various SYSA0n volumes.

100 cylinder 3390 hypervolumes:
 SYSD01 - SYSD primary (mcat, parmlib, proclibs, etc.)  roughly the
          replacement for SYS203, minus the DLIBs.
 SYSD02 - whatever didn't fit on SYSD01

Dedicated MVS volumes -- datasets placed on these volumes may vanish
without warning:
 MVSAR1 - flip/flop sysres (was part of SYS201)
 MVSAR2 - flip/flop sysres (was part of SYS202)
 MVSR3C - MVS SMP/E target volume (sysres) for IPO level 93C
 MVSD3C - MVS SMP/E dlib   volume          for IPO level 93C
