        BusTech/Fibronics boxes and Amelia; 87 LINES

I think I've pieced together the whole story on what happened with the BusTech
boxes last week.  I'm trying to document it so we'll know what to do next
time.

Early Friday morning (May 10th) the BusTech channel interface on SYSA (unit
addresses 00D0-00D2) failed, causing Amelia to ABEND.  Without Amelia, WYLBUR
has no way to connect to the front-end computers, so the Forsythe system is
for all practical purposes down.  The operators attempted to reset the box
(BusTech K2000) but were not able to get it restarted, so it was presumed to
have failed (these boxes sometimes have transient failures and respond to
restart).  There is a spare box for SYSA, a Bustech K200, but it also appeared
to be non-functional.  Operations staff then followed the procedure for using
the SYSD interface box on SYSA.

There is an operator procedure for reconfiguring the boxes and restarting
Amelia saved as WYL.GR.OPS.LIB#BUSTECH.  Standard procedure is first to try
the backup unit; if it fails, take the SYSD unit; if that fails, take the SYSH
unit.

To move the SYSD box to SYSA,

1.  bring down Amelia on SYSD:           C AMELIAD
2.  Vary 00E0-00E2 offline on SYSD:      V 00E0-00E2,OFFLINE
3.  Configure chpid 95 offline to SYSD:  CF CHP(95),OFFLINE
4.  Configure chpid 95 online to SYSA:   CF CHP(95),ONLINE
5.  Vary 00E0-00E2 online to SYSA:       V 00E0-00E2,ONLINE
6.  Start Amelia requesting alternate:   S AMELIA,ADDR=0E

Note that the ADDR parm builds the unit addresses (e.g. 0E0-0E2) in the jcl,
and that the AMELIA config file (WYL.GS.MIL.AMELIA.PARM on SYSA,
WYL.GS.MIL.SYSD.AMELIA.PARM on SYSD) defines such things as the IP address.
The K2000 itself is dumb and does not need to be configured differently for
different machines.  Also note that no cables are physically moved to do this
configuration -- it's all done with CHPIDs.

Ops staff completed the above procedure and brought Amelia back up on SYSA.
Subsequently Jim Stosick was able to reset the defective box successfully.  On
Saturday morning (May 11th) we did an IPL as part of maintenance, and Amelia
came up with the default SYSA unit addresses (00D0-00D2).

On Tuesday, Doug and I moved chpid 95 back to SYSD, varied 00E0-00E2 back
online to SYSD, and restarted AMELIAD.

The hardware is in NT Cabinet V68 (near the Fenwal red tank and PDU6).  In
order, top to bottom, we have:

Subject: Re: BusTech/Fibronics boxes and Amelia

The procedure should be to first try to reset the Bustech unit.  This normally
corrects the problem and no further action is needed.  Amelia will reconnect
to the Bustech and network access will be restored.  Generally this process
takes long enough that Wylbur sessions will be dropped.  Amelia doesn't
ABEND in this situation; it just waits for the Bustech to become available
again.

The problem Friday morning was that the operator started messing with the
channel path before resetting the Bustech.  With the channel path offline
the unit can't be reset.  Once the path was put back online I reset the
unit and verified that it was working correctly.

The SYSA primary unit is a Bustech ELC2, the backup unit is a Fibronics K2000.
The K2000 appears to be dead and there is no fix or replacement available
since the company is gone.
