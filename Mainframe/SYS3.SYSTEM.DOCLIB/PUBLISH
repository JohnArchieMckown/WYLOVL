 2TESTWYL> publish

 2Welcome to PUBLISH, a program for printing or ordering documents
 2relating to computing at Stanford and at the Stanford Data Center.
 2For help, type a question mark (?) in response to any prompt.
 2
 2Do you want general information and instructions?  (RETURN=no) _

  ____________________________________________________________________________

  User responses and program responses:

  Y, YES or OK:      go to step 2
  N or NO:           go to step 3
  ?, H or HELP:      see HELP below
  null (return):     go to step 3
  Q or QUIT          go to exit routine
  ATTN               go to exit routine
  anything else:     message: "Invalid response.  Type "?" for help."
                     then reprompt: "Do you want general info..."


  HELP: If the user requests help, the following is displayed:
  ____________________________________________________________________________
 2In response to the question, do one of the following:
 2
 2type YES or OK     - to get information and instructions about PUBLISH
 2type NO            - to begin ordering documents
 2type ? or HELP     - to get this help information

112. General Information / Instructions

  As in the current version of PUBLISH, a few screens of explanation will
  appear here.  The current text needs to be rewritten.  The text should be
  stored in such a way that it is easy for a non-programmer to maintain it.

  At the end of displaying the text, PUBLISH goes to step 3.

  If the user presses ATTN anywhere along the way, PUBLISH goes to step 3.

113. List of Document Categories

  prompted to choose one.

   n? (valid n,
    followed by ?):  see special help below
   null (return):    go to step 3
   L or LIST:        restart step 4
   C or CATEGORIES:  go to step 3
   Q or QUIT:        go to exit routine

                     then reprompt: "Type the number of a document..."

  HELP: If the user requests help, the following is displayed:
  ____________________________________________________________________________
 2In response to the question, do one of the following:
 2
 2type a number      - to begin ordering copies of the document with that number
 2type L or LIST     - to see the list of documents in this category again
 2type Q or QUIT     - if you are finished ordering documents
 2press RETURN       - to return to the list of document categories
 2type ? or HELP     - to get this help information
  ____________________________________________________________________________

  SPECIAL HELP: This is a holdover from the last version of PUBLISH.  Not many
  people used it, so we're introducing a new way to get more information about
  a document (see step 5.6).  However, for upward compatibility, we're retaining
  the old way too, though not advertising it.

  If the user types a valid document number, followed by a question mark,
  PUBLISH displays more information about the document (see step 5.6) and then
  reprompts "Type the number of a document..."

115. Desired Action for the Selected Document

  The number and name of the selected document is redisplayed (along with its
  publication date and number of pages), followed by a list of the possible
  choices for actions that can be taken for that document:
  ____________________________________________________________________________

 2   1)  Sep 1986   ADDRESS BOOK                                       4 pages
 2    [PUBLISH.MESSAGE element would appear here, if it occurs]

 2Actions you can choose for this document:
 2   1 - display more information about it
 2   2 - print it at Forsythe; deliver it to my output bin
 2   3 - print it at Forsythe; deliver it to me via ID mail
 2   4 - print it on a local department printer
 2   5 - place the text of this document in my WYLBUR active file
 2   6 - send it to me via ID mail
 2   0 - no action for this document
 2
 2Type the number of the action you want to take (RETURN=1):
  ____________________________________________________________________________

  General notes about the action list: Only the actions available for the chosen
  document will appear in the action list.  For instance, a document that doesn'
  have a useful "local printer" version (such as the 540-page SPIRES File
  Definition manual) would not offer that choice.  The person responsible for
  each document will determine what choices are available.  In fact, at no time
  would all 6 choices be available, since #5 is for documents that cannot be
  printed, such as help cards or others requiring special printing.

  Important: The numbers should not be permanently tied to specific actions.
  In the example above, if the third item were not appropriate for the document,
  it would not appear, and the fourth item would move up to third place as #3.

  The revised DOCUMENTS file definition will need elements to indicate what
  choices are available and which data set to use for a given choice.

  If the record in the SDC DOCUMENTS subfile contains occurrences of the
  PUBLISH.MESSAGE element, they will appear right after the document-title
  redisplay, as shown above.  Each occurrence of the element will be one line
  of the message (running from cols 5 to 79; hence, max length is 75 chars.).
  The message should also appear as part of the "display more information"
  for the document.

  User responses and program responses:

   valid n:          go to appropriate sub-step of 5
   null (return):    go to sub-step of 5 that matches to action #1
   0 (zero):         go to step 4
   L or LIST:        restart step 5
   C or CATEGORIES:  go to step 3
   Q or QUIT:        go to exit routine
   ATTN:             go to exit routine (verify user wants to quit)
   ?, H or HELP:     see HELP below
   anything else:    message: "Invalid response.  Type "?" for help."
                     then reprompt: "Type the number of the action..."

  HELP: If the user requests help, the following is displayed:
  ____________________________________________________________________________
 2In response to the question, do one of the following:
 2
 2type a number      - to take the action described for that number
 2type "0" (zero)    - to take no action; return to the list of documents
 2type L or LIST     - to see the list of actions for this document again
 2type Q or QUIT     - if you are finished ordering documents
 2type ? or HELP     - to get this help information

115.1. Print this document on a Forsythe printer; deliver to my output bin

  going to the user's output bin.  Here, PUBLISH asks how many copies and then
  submits the print request.

   ATTN:             go to exit routine (verify user wants to quit)
   ?, H or HELP:     see HELP below
   anything else:    message: "Invalid response.  Type "?" for help."
                     then reprompt: "Type the number of copies..."

  CHECKING THE PRINTER NAME.  Jim Stosick says he can provide a
  function in WYLBUR that can check whether the input value is a valid
  local printer name, and also, if so, whether it's a PostScript printer.
  If the name doesn't match a real printer, then the error message:

   "<input-string>" is not a valid local department printer name.

  is displayed and the question is reprompted.

  If the name is valid, PUBLISH then checks what type of data set is
  available for local printing.   If there is a PostScript data set
  available and the printer handles PostScript (as determined above),
  then that is the version used for printing.  If there is not a
  PostScript version, then the "text-only" version will be used for
  printing.  In either case, PUBLISH goes on (see below).

  If there is only a PostScript version of the document, but the printer
  cannot handle PostScript, then this error message:

   The requested document is stored in PostScript, which cannot be
   printed by the named department printer.  At the next prompt,
   either type the name of a printer that can print PostScript, or
   press Return to order the document another way.

  is displayed and the question is reprompted.


  Going on, PUBLISH summarizes the order and asks about changes....

  by the document provider.

  If the active file is empty, PUBLISH will simply go ahead and put the file
  into the active file.  Otherwise, it will ask about clearing...
