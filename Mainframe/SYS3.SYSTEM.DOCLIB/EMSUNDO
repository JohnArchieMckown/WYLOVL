Notes on how to add back a deleted element from an element list.

This documents a technique for adding back an ACCOUNT to an EMS
distribution list after it was deleted.  In this example, a user
has deleted their ACCOUNT from several EMS DISTRIBUTION lists,
and realizes this was an error, and wants the ACCOUNT reinstated.

You need to know these things to accomplish this task:

1.  The ACCOUNT that was deleted, and needs reinstatement.
    For the purposes of this example, we'll use:  GU.EST

2.  A list of the EMS DISTRIBUTION list keys that are affected,
    OR a TREE/DEFQ situation where the records in the DEFQ don't
    have the ACCOUNT, and those in the TREE still have the ACCOUNT.

We will assume the public EMS DISTRIBUTION list is involved.
If it is the user's personal DIST LISTS, the user should do
something like this themselves, using their private lists.

-> SELECT EMS DISTRIBUTION  ; or your private DIST LISTS subfile.
-> CLEAR FORMAT

If you have a list of keys, then make a stack of those keys, and
proceed to step C.  Otherwise, do steps A and B, then step C.

Step A.  Create a stack of the DEFQ records.

-> FOR DEFQ
-> STACK ALL

Step B.  Create another stack involving the user's ACCOUNT.

-> FOR TREE VIA STACK WHERE ACCOUNT = "GU.EST"
-> STACK ALL

If this doesn't produce a new stack, then you have to obtain
a list of keys, make a stack of those keys, and continue.

Step C.  Reinstate the user's ACCOUNT.

-> FOR STACK WHERE NOT ACCOUNT = "GU.EST"
-> SET INFOMES 0
-> WITH DATA MERGE ALL;  ACCOUNT(4093) = "GU.EST";
-> SET INFOMES 2

The last command appends the ACCOUNT in each record defined
by the stack, because occurrence 4093 should be beyond any
existing ACCOUNT occurrences.  (SPIRES limit is 4095).

How to do same-day recovery of removed records from EMS DISTRIBUTION


For future reference, this is what you can do:

Command? SPIRES
-> select ems distribution
-> for remove
-> show key all

If the key shows up in the list....

-> endfor
-> dequeue <thekey>

The privs to do this have been given to GQ.RLG, GG.SLP, GA.MCL
