                       How to use EMAIL page


The easy way is to add the following define command to your logon:

   DEFINE PAGE AS "MAIL TO pager@lindy TIT '" APPEND "'" REP

Then key into your WYLBUR active file the text you want to send (up
to 256 chars, but be aware that sometimes the latter part of a long
message gets a bit garbled).  Back at the command prompt, enter the
command:

         PAGE person.name

As an example, to page me, you would type:  PAGE SUSAN.PLASS

This way you can send messages that really need to reach the person
but don't need a response right away (Please read your mail when
you get home)  and emergency messages (emergency: system down and
won't come back up) and the person receiving the page knows whether
to race to a phone or handle it later.

Note: person.name is controlled by a lindy file, and is usually
the obvious name (first.last where first might be common nickname).
To be absolutely certain about names, examine the file on lindy:

      USE %/systems/local/pager/pager.list on lindy
