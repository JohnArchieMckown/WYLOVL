Notes of the care and feeding of the Christa User-ID address
space.

Christa is the MVS OS/390 address space which resolves English
like user identifiers to the Wylbur "gg.uuu" format.  Check the
following table for pointers on how to determine the status of
Christa and to restart the address space after a failure.

***Determining "connected" subsystems:

A useful Wylbur define command to have in your logon exec to pass
commands to the Christa address space is:

         > show def lik chris
           CHRISTA - xc wyl.gs.wyl.christa.src#command/...

One may then inquire which Stanford interactive systems are
currently "connected" and using Christa for name resolution.

***Insuring that the various Wylbur's get re-connected to Christa
   after a Christa abend.


If Christa abends and is restarted the current Wyblur's do not
understand how to reconnect.  This will change but in the meantime
you should enter each affected subsystem and issue the following
command:

         SET CHRISUID CHRISTA=PRIMARY

After issuing the SET CHRISUID command you should be able to see
that the subsystem is now connected via the CHRISTA ACTIVE command
if you have included the define command reference earlier.  Or
call the Christa command exec directly:

         XC WYL.GS.WYL.CHRISTA.SRC#COMMAND/Active
