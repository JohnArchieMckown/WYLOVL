External Tape Management (ETM) is maintained on GW.LIB
and GA.HMX on SYSA.  Plans are to migrate GA.HMX to
GS.ETM account, but that has not been done yet.

Documentation about the application, and a complete
parts list, is available in WYL.GW.LIB.ETM.DOC as
INTRO and PARTS members.  Some of the PTAPELIB file
in SPIRES needs to be primed with records defining
the tape series that is allowed.

As mentioned above, read the following:
