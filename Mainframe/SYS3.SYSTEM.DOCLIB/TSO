The table isn't very secret - I just like certain literary devices
to reduce the stress when under pressure ;)  It's IKJTSO00 in
PARMLIB.  The name, by the way sort of has to have a 00 suffix -
it's not as suffix-flexible as everybody else in parmlib for some
reason.  Although you can create a different suffix and activate it
with a TSO command, I believe the one sucked in at IPL must be -00.
