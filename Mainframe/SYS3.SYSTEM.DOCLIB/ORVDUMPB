                          ORVYL File Dumps


<.u+>ORVYL dump process<.u->

The dumps are staged automatically each night by a job which
contains definitions for all the file systems detailing which dumps
should run when.  <.i+>How are the staging jobs submitted?<.i->  See
the source in WYL.GG.ORV.SOURCE.FILEUTIL#VFD for the specifications
for each dump.

There are three types of ORVYL file dumps:  FULL, a complete dump
of an entire file system; INCREMENTAL, a progressive dump of all
changed blocks since the last full dump; and DAILY INCREMENTAL, an
incremental dump of only blocks changed since the last incremental
dump.


<.u+>Researching the status of an ORVYL dump<.u->

The root for all investigations related to ORVYL file dumps is in
the data set one of the following data sets:

         WYL.GG.ORV.ALPHA.STREAM on SYSA
         WYL.GG.ORV.BETA.STREAM on SYSB

The member MPINIT normally defines the file systems for that version
of ORVYL.  Check the //PARMS dd statement in the ORVYL (or ORVYLRLG)
proc to verify that this is indeed the current init member.

For each ORVYL file system, there is a definition in the init member
which describes the file system and which specifies via the INCLUDE=
parameter the name of the member which describes the data sets
which make up that file system.

To check the status of an ORVYL file system dump, run the following
job:

         //ORVLIST  JOB ,TIME=(,15)
         //LIST    EXEC PGM=FILEDUMP,PARM=LIST
         //STEPLIB  DD  DSN=WYL.GG.ORV.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR
         //CONTROL  DD  DSN=WYL.GG.ORV.ALPHA.STREAM(member),DISP=SHR

where <member> specifies the individual file system data set
description.

This job will list the contents of the dump history file for that
file system.

The SYSA jobs run under the account GS.ORV; look for them under
that account.  RLG dumps run under the account BP.ORV and have
the jobnames RLGDMPIB, BOOKDUMP, and NBKDUMP.  The output for the
dumps should contain detailed information about what was dumped and
what, if anything, went wrong.  Check this before continuing with
any dump problem resolution.


<.u+>Recovery from a dump failure<.u->

To recover from a failure of a full dump on any file system,
just resubmit the dump.  On SYSA, issue the command:

         S ORVMAINT,TYPE=MAN,OPT='filesystem DUMP'

On SYSB, issue the command:

         S RLGMAINT,TYPE=MAN,OPT='filesystem DUMP'


To recover from a failure of an incrememental dump on SYSA
incrementals on SYSB except BOOKS on SYSB, just resubmit the dump
with the command:

         S ORVMAINT,TYPE=MAN,OPT='filesystenm {INC|DUMP|VFRY}'

On SYSB, issue the same command specifying RLGMAINT instead of
ORVMAINT.

The incremental dump on SYSB for the BOOKS file system consists of
four segments; each of these must be started separately:  BKSRES1,
BKSRES2, BKSRES3, and INDEX.

The normal daily incremental dump backs up all blocks that have
changed since the last base dump.  The BOOKS daily incremental dump
set (4 jobs) dumps to disk all blocks changed since the last
<.u+>incremental<.u-> dump.  The disk file is then merged with the
last incremental dump tape to make a new incremental dump tape.

To force the BOOKS incremental dump to go to a full incremental
dump since the last base dump, comment out the 'DAILY' line in
the STREAM fle only for the segment that failed.  Then have RLG
restage the incremental dump.

Temporary data sets for changed blocks have names of the following
form on SYSA:

         WYL.GS.ORV.filesys.X.Dddddd.Ttttttt.P0n

On SYSB, these data set names have the form:

         WYL.BP.ORV.fileseg.X.Dddddd.Ttttttt.P0n

If the resubmitted job needs more space, scratch these data sets on
the EMER packs before rerunning the job.  This is especially likely
to be required for the BOOKS file system since it is so big.

Valid parms for the FILEDUMP program are:

     LIST - list the history file this file system
     DUMP - do a full dump for this file system
     INCREMENTAL - do an incremental dump for this file system
     OFFLOAD - merge the incremental on disk with last tape to
               get a new incremental tape (especially for BOOKS
               dump set).


If a file system is left in maintenance mode, issue the command

         SHOW VBLOCKS

to determine the name by which ORVYL knows the file system.  Use
that name to issue the command:

         SET NOVMAINT filesystem

to make the file read/write again.  ORVYL will prompt to be sure
that's what you really want -- be sure there are no dumps running
when you do this!
