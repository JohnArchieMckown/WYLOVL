                V - VSAM volume entry
                X - Alias name
                + - second or subsequent volume entry for this dataset   (1)
                0 - no catalog entry, dsn and volume were supplied       (5)
    3/46     Fully qualified data set name (dataset entry), GDG name
             (GDG base)

   63/70     UCBTYPE info from catalog
   72/81     Device description
   82/82     error code or blank.  Blank=normal case.  Other codes are:
               A = dataset migrated ("Archived") by HSM
               M = volume not Mounted
               D = DSCB not on volume
               X = unknown rcode from OBTAIN; the return code is displayed
                   in the "tracks allocated" field.
               Z = unknown code from SUPERLOCATE [catalog lookup]; the
                   return code is displayed in the "tracks allocated" field.
               If any error, DSCB information (cols. 83/168) fields are blank.

For tape files, the remaining columns are currently blank.  For disk files,
the following are filled in (see note 4).  For non-dataset entries, these
fields may have other information displayed in future implementations.

   83/90     Number of tracks used as decimal number nnnnn.nn

  197/204    Data Class (SMS)
  205/235    Reserved for future use

For multi-volume datasets on either disk or tape, there will be an entry for
each volume, in volume sequence order.  Second and subsequent entries will
show "entry type" of + and will include all relevant information.

Code that processes these reports should not depend on the contents of any
fields not specifically defined.  While columns omitted above are normally
blank, programs should not depend on this, as information could be added in
these "blank" fields.  Likewise, fields shown as omitted for certain entry
types may have information in future implementations.

Notes:
(1) this is a change from the previous SHOW CAT INT, which only listed the
    first volume.
(2) This is a slight change from previous SHOW CAT INT:  this field was three
    digits, and is now extended on the left to four.  There was an error in
    the HELP SHOW CAT text, this field was described as the volume sequence
    number.
(3) previously this was reported only for tape.
(4) This field and those following (through "changed") are similar to the old
    SHO DSN INT format, with the following changes:
         a. the fields start in a different location
         b. space used reported to .01 track, SHO DSN used integer value
         c. SHO DSN used mm/dd/yy format for dates.
(5) If a specific dsname is supplied (SHOW DSN ONLY=dsname) and a volume is
    also supplied, the specified data set is reported on even if not
    cataloged.  If CATTYPE=VTOC is specified (as in SHOW DSNAMES ON <volume>),
    no catalog lookup is attempted.  In such cases the catalog entry type is
    "0", the UCBTYPE information is that of the actual volume, and no SMS
    information (storage class, etc.) is listed.
