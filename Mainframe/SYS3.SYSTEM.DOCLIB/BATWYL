Maintaining BATWYL

The source code for BATWYL is kept under GQ.TES account.
(The "Production" code is kept under GQ.PRD).

  USE WYL.GQ.TES.PL360.BATWYL   ; Get source code.
  SAVE PL360.BATWYL             ; Save it on your account.
  RUN FROM RUN#BATWYL           ; Compile source and build BATWYL

Once the BATWYL PDS has been successfully built and tested, you
need to promote it to "Production" status.  This means that BATWYL
needs to be replaced within the SYS1.LINKLIST PDS.  Since this is
a library that affects the link-pack area, this "move" needs to be
done by a qualified Systems person, and the link-pack area needs
to be refreshed.  Ask Parker Gillespi how this is done.

When you're done, send an announcement of the changes to GQ.TES
via the SPIRES mailbox:

  SPIRES
  SEND SPIRES MAIL TO GQ.TES
  EXIT

With mail that looks like this:

&uuu.PL360.BATWYL
 - Description of your changes.
   As many lines as needed.

Once your version of PL360.BATWYL has moved back to GQ.TES, you
can scratch your version.  Wait for the announcement from GQ.TES.
