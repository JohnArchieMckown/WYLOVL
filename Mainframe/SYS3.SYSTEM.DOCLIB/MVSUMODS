OS/390 usermods source library

See SYS3.SYSTEM.DOCLIB#USERMODS


I've created a new library, SYS2.USERMODS.ASM, for OS/390.
SYS2.USERMODS.ASM contains Stanford-modified or -written source code
for miscellaneous exits and modules.  It is the OS/390 copy of
SYS2.XA.USER.SOURCE.  Whenever a module from SYS2.XA.USER.SOURCE is
needed in OS/390, copy it to this new library, making any mods
needed to source or JCL.  Please copy only needed modules.  The
intention is that when OS/390 goes production, we will have a
current library of source mods here.

I've moved ICHNCV00, the RACF dsname conversion module, into this
library and installed it in SYS1.LPALIBE.
