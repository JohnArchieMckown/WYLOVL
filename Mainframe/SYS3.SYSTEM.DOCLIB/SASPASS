RLG runs SAS 8.01 and SAS/C 5.5 on SYSB.

SYSB SAS libraries reside in:
  SYS4.SASV801.*
  SYS4.SASC.C550.*

SYSB passwords are sent by SAS Institute to Don Brown.  The new text
is used to update a member in the CNTL data set.  As usual, it is a
good practice to make a backup copy of the member prior to updating
them --- Just is case you make a mistake, Who, you make a
MISTAKE...NAH!  ;-)...

Update the following data sets with the new password provided by SAS

  SYS4.SASV609.CNTL#RENEWPRM          ; For SAS 6.09 on SYSA
  SYS4.SASV801.CNTL#RENEWPRM          ; For SAS 8.01 on SYSA
  SYS4.SASC.C550.CNTL#NTINITP         ; For SASC 5.50 on SYSA

  SYS4.SASV608.CNTL#RENEWPRM          ; For SAS 6.08 on SYSB
  SYS4.SASV801.CNTL#RENEWPRM          ; For SAS 8.01 on SYSB
  SYS4.SASC.C550.CNTL#NTINITP         ; For SASC 5.50 on SYSB

Once the data sets have been updated, run the following jobs:

  SYS4.SASV801.CNTL#RENEW             ; For SAS 8.01 on SYSB
  SYS4.SASC.C550.CNTL#NTRENEW         ; For SASC 5.50 on SYSB


That's it, all there is left to do is for you to run a SAS batch job
just to make sure that there are no errors with the new password.
