                     ICF Catalog Backup Process


Each night a job is run by SUBMIT to back up the system catalogs.
A job named MVS#DALY in SUBMIT under gg.mvs in turn runs the backup
job CAT#BACK from WYL.GG.MVS.LIB#CATBACK.

The SYSA master catalog is listed and the output from that list
saved as the first file on the tape.  Then both master catalogs are
backed up followed by the user catalogs in alphabetical order.  One
snag in this process is that the backup will not run if the master
cannot be listed.

This job also puts a list of the backup tapes which are currently
catalogued in the backup GDG in the data set SYS3.CATBACK.LIST on
SYSA01.  (It's put in a well-defined place in case you can't find it
via the catalog!)  It also sends a message to the distribution list
icfcat-status reporting success or failure of the backup.

To add a new catalog to this backup, add both a DD statement and
EXPORT command in alpha order.  Then shift the remaining LABEL
statements as required.  Reverse this to remove a catalog from the
backups.

The following catalogs are currently backed up:


    CATALOG.CICSSMPE
    CATALOG.FIN
    CATALOG.HSM
    CATALOG.IPO93C
    CATALOG.LIBG
    CATALOG.MCATSYSA
    CATALOG.MCATSYSD
    CATALOG.MISCSY1
    CATALOG.PPS
    CATALOG.SYSN1
    CATALOG.TSO
    CATALOG.UCATCICS
    CATALOG.VSAM
    CATALOG.VSAMOOD
    CATALOG.WYL
    CATALOG.WYL0
    CATALOG.WYL1
    CATALOG.WYL2
    CATALOG.WYL3
