                       ORVYL File Dumps


ORVYL dump process:

The dumps are staged automatically each night by a job which
contains definitions for all the file systems detailing which
dumps should run when.  There is a job called ORVESTV which runs
every night after midnight and sets the scheduling variables for
all the file systems (start time, tape drive allocation, etc.).


There are three types of ORVYL file dumps:

FULL, a complete dump of an entire file system.

INCREMENTAL, a progressive dump of all changed blocks since the last
full dump.

DAILY INCREMENTAL, an incremental dump of only blocks changed since
the last incremental dump.  (the tape portion of the incremental
dumps is a separate job called xxx2TAPE where 'xxx' is the first 3
digits of the file system name.)


Research the status of an ORVYL dump:

The root for all investigations related to ORVYL file dumps is in
the data set as seen in one of the following data sets:

         WYL.GG.ORV.ALPHA.STREAM on SYSA
         WYL.GG.ORV.BETA.STREAM on SYSB


The member MPINIT normally defines the file systems for that version
of ORVYL.  Check the //PARMS dd statement in the ORVYL (or ORVYLRLG)
proc to verify that this is indeed the current init member.

For each ORVYL file system, there is a definition in the init member
which describes the file system and which specifies via the
INCLUDE=parameter the name of the member which describes the data
sets which make up that file system.

To check the status of an ORVYL file system dump, run the following
job:

      //ORVLIST  JOB  ,TIME=(,15)
      //LIST    EXEC  PGM=FILEDUMP,PARM=LIST
      //STEPLIB  DD   DSN=WYL.GG.ORV.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR
      //CONTROL  DD   DSN=WYL.GG.ORV.APHPA.STREAM(member),DISP=SHR

where <member> specifies the individual file system data set
description.  This job will list the contents of the dump history
file for that file system.

The SYSA jobs run under the account GS.ORV; look for them under
that account.  RLG dumps run under the account BP.ORV.  The output for
the dumps do contain detailed information about what was dumped and
what, if anything, went wrong.  Check this before continuing with
any dump problem resolution.

To recover from any ORVYL dump failure on SYSA, maintenance job,
incremental, or full dump, review jobs in WYL.GS.ORV.ZEKELIB.

Temporary data sets for changed blocks have names of the following
form on SYSA:

        WYL.GS.ORV.filesys.X.Dddddd.Ttttttt.P0n

On SYSB, these data set names have the form:

        WYL.BP.ORV.fileseg.X.Dddddd.Ttttttt.P0n

If the resubmitted job needs more space, scratch these data sets on
the DMPXXX packs before rerunning the job.  This is especially
likely to be required for the BOOKS file system since it is so big.

Valid parms for the FILEDUMP program are:

      LIST - list the history file this file system
      DUMP - do a full dump for this file system
      INCREMENTAL- do an incremental dump for this file system
      OFFLOAD - merge the incremental on disk with last tape to
                get a new incremental tape (especially for BOOKS
                dump set).

If a file system is left in maintenance mode, issue the command
SHOW VBLOCKS to determine the name by which ORVYL knows the file
system.  Use that name to issue the command:

         SET NOVMAINT filesystem

This will make the file read/write again.  ORVYL will prompt to be
sure that's what you really want -- be sure there are no dumps
running when you do this!

SYSB:

Locate appropriate cataloged procedures in SYS3.BETAPROC

1)  What happened
2)  Fix it
3)  Have RLG resubmit failed dump process

In general procs in form xxxDUMP or xxxINC except for BOOKS.  For
BOOKS:

     BOOKDRS 1
             2
             3
             4
             5
             DIDX
For BOOK INC - BOOKINC

To recover from any ORVYL DUMP failure on SYSA, maintenance job,
incremental, or full dump, review procedures for SYSB.
