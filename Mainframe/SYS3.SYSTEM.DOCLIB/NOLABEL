NOLABEL:  Initialize an unlabeled tape.          Mark Lawrence 1996/04/08

This program functions similar to IEHINITT but for unlabeled tapes.  It writes
an 80-byte "nonlabel" record at the beginning of the tape.  It sets BLP in a
modified JFCB to avoid the conversion of BLP to NL in the system.

This program is intended for tape librarian use only.

Security:  Program checks for RACF FACILITY class access to profile
TAPE.VOLINIT, terminates abnormally if no access.  Program must run
APF-authorized.  Job account must have ALTER authority for the volume, as OPEN
security will check access to the specified volser.

JCL:  Cataloged procedure NOLABEL in SYS3.PROCLIB; typical execution would be:

//INIT JOB GW.LIB,'Initialize EX1234'
/*SETUP T6250 OUTPUT=EX1234
/*SETUP **TAPE BEING INITIALIZED, REPLY M TO SDC701D ***
//UNLABEL EXEC NOLABEL,VOL=EX1234

Return Codes:
         0     Normal completion
        12     OPEN failed
        16     Missing TAPE DD statement
        20     Operator replied S to message
     ABEND     Job account not authorized in RACF

Notes:  The "nonlabel" record contains '****' in columns 1-4 where a volume
label would have VOL1, then the volser in columns 5-10 as in a volume label.
The record also has a date/time stamp for the init job.
