                         WYLBUR System NEWS


NEWS PUBLIC contains important items of immediate interest about changes or
additions to the Data Center system.

DOC#UPDATE, another online file, contains more detailed information about
technical subjects, new software, and new or revised documents.  To read
DOC#UPDATE, type the command UTIL UPDATE.

To read the latest news, type SHOW NEWS or, in this file, type LIST 20/L
To list all item titles for table of contents, type: LIST '*' 1
For a particular topic, type:  VIEW 'topic'

To read NEWS items (as well as UPDATE articles--see next paragraph) that are
out of date, issue these commands:

     SPIRES
     SELECT NEWS ARCHIVE
     EXPLAIN NEWS ARCHIVE

The following is adapted from WYL.GA.MCL.NEWS.LIB(TECHNOTE)
rev.  1999/03/31:


This is a collection of random notes about maintenance of NEWS
PUBLIC and UPDATE PUBLIC.  This information is intended for those
who maintain the EXEC files, access lists, etc., and is not needed
by those who only write, edit, and install articles.  Send comments
and corrections to Mark Lawrence.


<.b+>NEWS PUBLIC<.b->

NEWS PUBLIC is the mechanism by which WYLBUR users get system news.
There is a dataset, WYL.GA.PUB.NEWS, that contains the news items.
(Note:  the option PUBLIC on a dsname means ACCOUNT GA.PUB so NEWS
PUBLIC and WYL.GA.PUB.NEWS are one and the same).  WYLBUR loads a
copy of NEWS PUBLIC into its address space on startup, and reloads
it when the command SET WNEWS is issued.  WYLBUR has code for
parsing the headlines to detect the start of a new article, and the
date of the article.  Therefore, the headline format described in
the HOWNEWS instructions is not merely a matter of editorial taste
-- it must be followed for the news display mechanism to work
properly.

When a user does SHOW NEWS, or logs on with AUTO NEWS set, WYLBUR
checks its current copy of news to see if there are articles newer
than those previously read by the user.  WYLBUR keeps a "last news
read date" in its records for each user.

Note that with several WYLBURs running (WYLBUR, TESTWYL, etc.) the
SET WNEWS command must be issued in each of them when NEWS is
updated.  The ADDNEWS and ADDUPD execfiles do this automatically for
WYLBUR and TESTWYL.

<.B+>UPDATE PUBLIC<.B->

UPDATE PUBLIC is used for articles too long for NEWS, or articles
that need to be kept longer than is reasonable for NEWS.  Although
the display of UPDATE articles appears similar to NEWS for clients,
the mechanism is quite different.  UPDATE information is displayed
by doing UTIL UPDATE; this invokes LIB#UPDATE PUBLIC, which in turn
calls an extended EXEC, LIB#UPDATEX PUBLIC.  The articles are
contained in DOC#UPDATE PUBLIC.  The format restrictions are similar
to those for NEWS, but no special WYLBUR commands are needed when
updating them, as UTIL UPDATE always causes a fresh reading of the
dataset.

<.b+>News Maintenance<.b->

EXEC files and notes (including this one) are kept in LIB on account
GA.NEW:

   ADDNEWS   (execfile) Add or revise NEWS article
   ADDUPD    (execfile) add an article to UPDATE
   HOWNEWS   Instructions for updating NEWS
   HOWUPD    Instructions for adding UPDATE articles
   NEWSDIR   Directory of files for online NEWS
   PRODNEWS  job run by ADDNEWS to update production WYLBUR NEWS
   TECHNOTE  notes on NEWS maintenance [THIS NOTE]
   TESTNEWS  job run by ADDNEWS TO update NEWS in TESTWYL

<.b+>Maintenance Authority<.b->

News maintance functions may be done from the functional account
GA.NEW or from any account that has appropriate access.  To have
access, an account must:

1.  Have access to the NEWS datasets.  Add the account to the RACF
    group NEWSADM.  [RACF CO gg.uuu NEWSADM USE]

2.  Have update authority for the SPIRES file NEWS ARCHIVE.  To
    grant this access, logon to GA.PUB and:

         SPIRES
         SELECT FILEDEF
         TRA GA.PUB.ARCHIVE
         <- modify the 4 long lists of accounts near the end as desired.
            Basically they should all be the same.
         UPDATE

    That does it.

3.  Be included in the NEWSHOUNDS distribution list.  This list is a
    superset of news maintainers, that is, some on this list are not
    authorized to update NEWS.  To change the NEWSHOUNDS
    distribution list, your account must have update authority for
    it (currently JNK and MCL have authority).  From one of the
    authorized accounts, do EMS ADMIN and follow procedures for
    updating a distribution list.
