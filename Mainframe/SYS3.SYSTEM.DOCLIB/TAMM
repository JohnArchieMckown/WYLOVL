So far I've found two pieces for TAMM:  there is a piece which runs
in a PC in Operations -- source for that should be on the PC.

In addition, there is a started task which runs constantly on SYSA
and SYSB named TAMMMON.  The proc is in SYS1.PROCLIB.  It is a
BATWYL job which executes a script in WYL.GW.TAP.TAMM.PROD.SCRIPT.
This exec gets into SERVWYL (if up), then calls another exec,
WYL.GW.TAP.TAMM.FESCRIPT, which does some checking to make sure
the environment is right (no other TAMM running, for example).
If all is well, FESCRIPT calls WYL.GW.TAP.TAM.PROD.EXEC to do the
real work.  Note that this exec has come checking for device or
tape type, which could cause problems with Magstar when we start
using it...

When one of the execs detects an error it sends email with a lot of
debugging information to the variable X.DebugAccts.  I've set up a
distribution list for the exec to send debugging info instead of
updating the execs each time the victim (I mean volunteer!) changes.
That dist list is TAMMMON.  (Note the 3 Ms -- I always mistype
it at least once.)
