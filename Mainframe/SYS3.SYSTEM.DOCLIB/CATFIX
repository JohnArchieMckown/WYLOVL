CATFIX:  program to correct catalog entries
Author:  Mark C. Lawrence
Revised: 1996/01/24


CATFIX catalogs, uncatalogs, and recatalogs data sets on disk or
general, the goal is to end up with a good catalog entry for the data
set.  CATFIX is invoked by a cataloged procedure of the same name.
The caller must have update authority for the dataset.

CATFIX can perform several different types of catalog update
functions:

*  Correct UCBTYPE information when it has changed as a result of
   disk conversion

*  Use actual UCBTYPE information to replace esoteric unit name
   information

*  Catalog datasets that are not cataloged

*  Recatalog datasets that were cataloged on other volumes

*  Recatalog datasets that were cataloged on a specific other volume

*  Correct DSCBTTR entries

*  Delete catalog entries for nonexistant disk datasets

Specifying the data set:  This program can process one or multiple
data sets.  A single dataset name can be specified with the DSNAME
parameter in the PARM, in which case only that data set will be
processed, and SYSIN will not be opened.

If the DSNAME parameter is not specified in the parm, then data set
names (and, optionally, volumes) are read from SYSIN.  The data set
name is in columns 1-44, and the volume is in cols.  45-50.  If a
volume is not specified, cols. 45-50 must be blank.

Options are specified in the PARM field of the EXEC statement.  In
addition to DSNAME described above, the following options are
available.  The minimum abbreviation allowable for each keyword is
the portion shown in uppercase.

[NO]CATalog    (default:  NOCATALOG)  Data sets that are not
               cataloged will be cataloged.  If NOCATALOG is in
               effect, data sets that are not cataloged will not
               be processed.

[NO]DEVTABle   (default:  NODEVTABLE)  When checking UCBTYPE, if
               the volume is not mounted then a table of volume
               prefixes will be consulted to determine the
               correct type.  The table contains both disk and
               tape devices.

[no]DSCbcheck  (default:  DSCBCHECK)  For data sets being
               cataloged or recataloged on disk, the TTR of the
               DSCB will be put in the catalog entry.  For
               already cataloged data sets, the value, if any,
               in the catalog entry will be checked and replaced
               if necessary.  If the DSCB is not found, the data
               set will not be cataloged, and, if UNCATALOG is in
               effect, it will be uncataloged.

[NO]RECATalog  (default:  NORECATALOG)  If a data set is already
               cataloged on a different volume than the one
               specified, it will be recataloged anyway.  This
               option is relevant only if CATALOG and VOL are
               specified.

RECATalog=oldvol
               If a dataset is cataloged on the named "old" volume,
               it will be recataloged to the newly specified volume.
               If it is cataloged on any other volume, it will not be
               recataloged.

REPort={ALL|NOne|EXceptions} (default: ALL)  Indicates the level of
               reporting on the REPORT dataset.  REPORT=ALL requests
               that one record be written for each dataset processed.
               REPORT=NONE suppresses the reports (as will the
               absence of a REPORT DD statement).  REPORT=EXCEPTIONS
               requests that a report record be written only for
               exceptional conditions, that is, the new status is not
               "cataloged".

[no]SIMulate   (default:  NOSIMULATE)  Allows simulation of catalog
               processing.  CATFIX will "go through the motions" of
               cataloging/recataloging and will produce messages and
               report file as if it had been done, but no changes
               will be made to the catalog.

[no]UCBcheck   (default:  UCBCHECK)  When recataloging existing data
               sets, the UCBTYPE field in the catalog entry will be
               verified and, if necessary, corrected.  Pseudo-device
               codes will always be changed to actual device codes.
               If the volume is not mounted, no checking will be done
               unless the DEVTABLE option is in effect.

[no]UNCatalog  (default:  NOUNCATALOG)  For existing datasets on
               disk, delete the catalog entry if the dataset is not
               on the cataloged volume.  Implies DSCBCHECK.

VOLume=volser  (default:  none)  If a volume is specified, then any
               uncataloged data set being cataloged with the CATALOG
               option, or recataloged with the RECATALOG option, will
               be presumed to be on that volume.  If VOL is not
               specified, then the volume for a newly cataloged data
               set must be specified on SYSIN.

Volume specification

A volume serial may be specified either with the VOLUME option or on
the SYSIN record; the VOLUME option overrides SYSIN.  This volume is
used in both CATALOG and RECATALOG operations as described below.


Each data set name is looked up in the catalog.  If the data set is
not cataloged and CATALOG is in effect, action proceeds as described
below under "UNCATALOGED DATA SETS"; if NOCATALOG is in effect, no
action is taken.


RECATALOGING

If the data set is already cataloged, then the UCBCHECK and DSCBCHECK
operations will be performed if applicable.  If a volume is specified
(with the VOL option or on the SYSIN record), it is checked against
the cataloged volume.  If the cataloged volume is different, action
depends on the RECATALOG option.  If NORECATALOG is in effect, an
error message is issued and no action is taken.  If RECATALOG
(without an "oldvol" value) is in effect, the data set will be
recataloged on the new volume.  If RECATALOG=oldvol is in effect,
then the dataset will be recataloged on the new volume only if it was
previously cataloged on "oldvol".  Note that NORECAT does not prevent
recataloging of data sets to correct unit or DSCBTTR information; it
just prevents changing volumes in the catalog entry.


UNCATALOGED DATA SETS

If the data set is not cataloged and no volume is specified on SYSIN,
an error message is issued and no other action is taken.

If the data set is not cataloged and a volume is specified on SYSIN,
DSCB/DEVTYPE checking is performed if requested and the data set is
cataloged (unless the DSCB could not be found).

If the data set is not cataloged but is an index in the catalog, an
error message is issued and no other action is taken.

UCBDEVTYPE checking

For mounted direct-access devices the UCBDEVTYPE is checked against
that in the catalog entry; if the cataloged type is wrong, the data
set will be recataloged with the correct type.  For nonmounted direct
access devices, a UCBDEVTYPE is obtained from a table if possible.

DSCB  checking

If the DSCBCHECK option is in effect the DSCB will be OBTAINed if the
volume is mounted.  If the DSCB is not found, an error message is
issued and the data set will not be cataloged.  If the set is found,
the DSCB address (DSCBTTR) in the catalog entry is checked, and, if
wrong, the data set is recataloged.

For data sets being newly cataloged (see UNCATALOGED DATA SETS
above), these checks are performed and the results used in the new
catalog entry.

Reporting and message output:

CATFIX produces messages on SYSPRINT describing the processing of
each dataset, and brief messages on SYSTERM for errors.  It also
produces a REPORT file with one record per dataset.  This file has
the following format:

....v....1....v....2....v....3....v....4....v....5....v....6....
 DSN=dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd  VOL=vvvvvv

     v....7....v....8....v....9....v....A....v....B
     WAS: x  NOW: y  <explanation>

Where
   ddd...      is the dataset name
   vvvvvv      is the volume (from SYSIN, VOL parameter, or catalog)
   x           is a code for the old status
   y           is a code for the new status
  <exp>        is a message explaining new status of not cataloged

Status codes:

   C  Cataloged
   G  name is GDG reference to future generation
   M  volume is not Mounted
   N  Not cataloged
   O  cataloged on some Other volume
   S  Syntax error in dsname
   V  no Volume known (not cataloged, and no volume specified)


If REPORT=EXCEPT is specified in the PARM, then a report record is
written only if the "new status" code is not "C".

EXAMPLES

1.  Check and if necessary correct UCB and DSCB information for an
    existing cataloged dataset WYL.GG.UUU.MYDATA:

//  JOB
//  EXEC CATFIX,
//   PARM=(DSCB,UCB,'DSN=WYL.GG.UUU.MYDATA')

2.  Check all the datasets on PUB234 to see that they are correctly
    cataloged.  Catalog any that are not cataloged.  Do not force
    recataloging of any that are cataloged elsewhere.  Do not check
    DSCB information.

// JOB  GW.DSK,'PUB234 fix',TIME=2,CLASS=C
//LISTVTOC  EXEC  DISKLOOK,VOL=PUB234,ACC='WYL.',          <- read vtoc
//  OPTION='TERM,NOPRINT,NOTHDR,NOFREE'
//SYSTERM DD DSN=&&VTOC,DISP=(,PASS),UNIT=VIO,DCB=PRINT,
// SPACE=(13300,(2000,20))
//BLDCMD EXEC IEBGENER,COND=(5,LT)
//SYSUT1 DD DSN=&&VTOC,DISP=OLD
//SYSUT2 DD DSN=&&CMD,DISP=(,PASS),UNIT=VIO,DCB=CARD,
// SPACE=(8000,(2000,20))
//SYSIN DD *                                               <-edit list
 GENERATE MAXFLDS=2
 RECORD FIELD=(44,2,,1),FIELD=(6,120,,45)
//FIXCAT EXEC CATFIX,COND=(5,LT),
//   PARM=(NODSCB,UCB,NORECAT,CAT,UNCAT,'REPORT=EXCEPT')
//SYSTERM DD SYSOUT=A
//SYSIN DD DSN=&&CMD,DISP=OLD
//REPORT DD SYSOUT=C

3.  Volume PUB123 has been migrated to PUB234; force all datasets now
    on PUB234 that are cataloged on PUB123 to be cataloged on PUB234.
    Do not recatalog datasets that are cataloged elsewhere.  Check
    DSCBs and include DSCBTTR info in the catalog entries.  Report
    exceptions.

// JOB  GW.DSK,'PUB234 fix',TIME=2,CLASS=C
//LISTVTOC  EXEC  DISKLOOK,VOL=PUB234,ACC='WYL.',
//  OPTION='TERM,NOPRINT,NOTHDR,NOFREE'
//SYSTERM DD DSN=&&VTOC,DISP=(,PASS),UNIT=VIO,DCB=PRINT,
// SPACE=(13300,(2000,20))
//BLDCMD EXEC IEBGENER,COND=(5,LT)
//SYSUT1 DD DSN=&&VTOC,DISP=OLD
//SYSUT2 DD DSN=&&CMD,DISP=(,PASS),UNIT=VIO,DCB=CARD,
// SPACE=(8000,(2000,20))
//SYSIN DD *
 GENERATE MAXFLDS=2
 RECORD FIELD=(44,2,,1),FIELD=(6,120,,45)
//FIXCAT EXEC CATFIX,COND=(5,LT),
//   PARM=(DSCB,UCB,'RECAT=PUB123',CAT,'REPORT=EXCEPT')
//SYSTERM DD SYSOUT=A
//SYSIN DD DSN=&&CMD,DISP=OLD
//REPORT DD SYSOUT=C

Note that in the above two examples, a set of volumes could be done
by coding a partial qualifier in the DISKLOOK parmlist, e.g.,
VOL=PUB2 would do all PUB2xx volumes.
