HSM Control Dataset Recovery                               1997/07/02

HSM has three control datasets:  MCDS (migration control dataset), OCDS
(offline C.D.S.), BCDS (backup C.D.S.).  The MCDS manages migration copies,
the BCDS dump and backup information, the OCDS tape volumes.  See the HSM
Implementation Guide (SH21-1078) for more detailed descriptions of these
datasets.  All of the CDS are VSAM files.

Currently the MCDS, HSMSYS.MCDS, is on its own hipervolume (HSMX01) and in its
own catalog, for performance reasons.  Refer to the implementation guide for a
discussion of performance and lockout considerations for these datasets.

The fourth dataset is the journal, HSM.JRNL, which is a flat file containing a
record of each HSM transaction.  The journal can be used to reconstruct any of
the CDS from a backup.  In general, one reconstructs a CDS by restoring the
most recent usable backup copy, and applying journal transactions that were
logged after that backup was made.  Recovery is discussed in the HSM Storage
Administration Guide, SH21-1076.

HSM does its own backups as the first (currently only) thing when automatic
backup begins (currently 2300 every day).  The journal and all 3 CDS are
backed up, each to its own 3480 tape, in parallel.  The journal is then
cleared.

The following discussion is of MCDS recovery; recovery of any other CDS is
similar.

If the MCDS is damaged, the recovery procedure is:

1.  If possible, issue QUERY CDSVERSIONBACKUP to HSM to obtain information on
    the latest backup versions.  Otherwise, do SHOW CAT LIK WYL.GS.HSM.MCDS to
    see what names are cataloged.  The names consist of the above stem
    suffixed by a sequence number, such as D0000089.  The sequence number
    (LLQ) is the same for all four backup sets (MCDS, OCDS, BCDS, JRNL).
    Currently seven generations of backups (one week) are retained, and these
    are under TLMS Auto-Scratch control by catalog.  One could obtain
    information on the latest versions by examining a list of tapes held by
    GS.HSM account.

2.  Stop HSM on all systems, if it's still up.

3.  Run jobs ARCBJRNL and RECOVMCD (both in WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB and in
    WYL.GA.MCL.SMS.LIB) to recover journal and MCDS, respectively.  ARCBJRNL
    may be run to recover only the current journal, or to also recover one or
    more backup copies.  If the most recent MCDS backup is good, only the
    current journal need be recovered.  Otherwise, recover the most recent
    usable MCDS backup, and all journal copies made since that one.  Thus, if
    the most recent backup sequence is 89, but the most recent two MCDS backup
    copies are bad, one would recover MCDS.D0000087, JRNL.D00000088, and
    JRNL.D00000089, in addition to the current journal.  The JCL for these two
    jobs must be modified accordingly; refer to the comments in the JCL and to
    the Storage Administration Guide.

    Note that RECOVMCD will destroy the current MCDS.  You might want to run a
    DSS dump of it before attempting any recovery operations.

4.  Run job IMPCDS to merge the recovered CDS with the recovered journal(s).

5.  Restart HSM on one system.

6.  Do AUDIT DATASETCONTROLS(MIGRATION) NOFIX OUTDATASET(dsn for listing) -
         REPORT(ERRORS)

    and see what errors are flagged.  You can reissue the AUDIT command with
    FIX instead of NOFIX to have HSM correct the errors.

    Note:  This and other HSM commands are issued from a TSO session with the
    HSEND command.

7.  After fixing errors, restart HSM on the other system if applicable.

Various HSM-related JCL may be found in WYL.GA.MCL.SMS.LIB; copies of
the more critical ones are in WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB.
