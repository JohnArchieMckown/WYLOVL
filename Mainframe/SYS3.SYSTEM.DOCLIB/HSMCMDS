                        useful hsm commands

You can send commands to HSM from a TSO session using the HSEND
command.  Some useful commands are:

query active                       show what is running, what is held

query cdsversionbackup             info on backup process for control
                                   datasets (this is the one we run
                                   at 2300 nightly)

query setsys                       sho system setting values (from parmlib
                                   and subsequent changes)

query startup                      show startup parameters (including name of
                                   parmlib member whence they came)

release all                        release all held processes

query controldatasets              check status and space usage of CDS

query space(volser)                sho space use on an ML1 volume

A brief writeup on maintenance of the migration-level-1 functions and
volumes is in WYL.GA.MCL.SMS.LIB(ML1NOTE).
