                         <.u+>Basic Instructions<.u->

The first rule of using an OS/2 system, much like the Mac, is:

        <.i+>Don't power off the system without shutting it down<.i->
        <.i+>logically first!!!!<.i->

Data is cached in memory and must be written out before shutdown
or it will be lost.  And the system will go through disk verification
at the next power up.

Please take the time to get a bit familiar with OS/2 before you
get started.  It's enough different from the Mac to warrant a bit
of time in the tutorial.  In order to start the tutorial, double-
click on the icon:

                         <Icon> Start Here

This will take you on a 10-minute tour of OS/2.  In addition, the
Getting Started manual should be next to the machine on the desk.

We will normally leave the system powered up during the week, but
the monitor should be shut off at the end of each day.

So far I have installed only the IBM Online Library Starter Kit.  It
has most of the manuals for most of what we use.  I will be
installing other CD sets as I have time -- you'll see the choices in
the IBM Online Library window when you open it.  If you have a
favorite you'd like me to get to sooner than later, let me know.

The Starter Kit consists of 4 CDs; normally you should leave the
system with the first disk, MVS, loaded.  You will know the
collection you want isn't on the loaded CD if the window comes up
empty when you select it!  To use a different disk, eject the CD,
swap disks, and reload.  If BookManager doesn't refresh the window
automatically, pull down the menu View and select Refresh.

The description below is a very brief introduction to using
Library Reader.  Exploration of the more advanced features such as
keyword searching in more than one document is left as an exercise
for the reader.

         <.u+>A Brief Tour of the DTR Library BookManager System<.u->

When you sit down to the BookManager system you will normally
find it in one of the following states:

   1)  Machine powered on, but screen off -- turn on screen with
       button on front of screen.  You're probably now in state 2.

   2)  Machine powered on, screen on but locked; this is a
       screen-saver function -- type the password

                           LIBRARY<enter>

       It should show you the desktop.  You should now be in
       state 3.

   3)  OS/2 desktop showing --  go on to start BookManager.

If you find the system in a state other than the above, it's either
in use (come back later...) or someone left it in an appropriate
state.  (Oops, you wouldn't do that, would you?)  See Mike Durket
or me for help at this point.

                  <.u+>Using BookManager -- An Example<.u->

Find the icon near the middle of the screen labelled:

                     <Icon> IBM Online Library

Double-click on this icon.  This displays a window entitled:

                  IBM Online Library - Icon View.

This window contains one Icon for each of the Collections currently
installed in BookManager.  Position the mouse on one you'd like to
open and double-click on it.  A likely candidate might be:

                 <Icon> Starter Kit:  MVS Platform

A license disclaimer will appear -- click on OK to continue.  Then
a window will be opened with the title:

                 BookManager Books and Bookshelves

A list of the Bookshelves included in that Collection will be
displayed.  Each Bookshelf has a cryptic id (its folder name),
English title, and last update date.  Position yourself on the
Bookshelf line and double-click.  Two likely candidates to look for:

    EZ2MVMKA  MVS: MVS/DFP V3 R3
      ...
    EZ2MVNBA  MVS: MVS/ESA JES2 V4 R2.2   (we don't have 4.2.3)

If you select the MVS option, a new window will with the catchy
title:

         BookManager Bookshelf - MVS: MVS/ESA JES2 V4 R2.2

A list of the Books included on that Bookshelf will be displayed.
Again each Book has a cryptic id (its file name), English title,
date, and document number (you'll have to scroll to see the last
field).  Position yourself on the Book list and double-click.  Let's
say you have a driving curiousity to look up MVS system services
and select

    IEAA4MST  Authorized Assembler Programming Reference, Volume 4

A copyright notice will appear -- click on OK to continue.  Then
two windows will open; one will have the even more catchy title:

   BookManager Book - Authorized Assembeler Programming Reference

and the second window will contain the Table of Contents for that
manual.  Page through the contents and double-click on a chapter of
interest, say UCBLOOK to get still another window:

  Topic 25.0 UCBLOOK - Obtain the Address of a UCB Common Segment

and scroll through the text until done.  To get out, double-click
on the menu box in the upper left corner.  A dialogue box will
pop up asking you if you want to leave a bookmark permanently in
that place:  <.i+>Please don't!<.i-> unless you really have a need to
return to that place.  Unfortunately I haven't found a way to change
the default, so you'll have to tell it each time.

Back up closing each of the windows until you close the IBM Online
Library window and are left with just the desktop.
