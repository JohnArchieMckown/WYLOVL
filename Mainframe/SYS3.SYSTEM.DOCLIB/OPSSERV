                    The OPS Service Tangled Web


To update the message shown by SHO SERVICE, the operators run
the exec WYL.GR.OTS.SERVICE#SETSERVI.  A short summary of the
status of each service is saved in WYL.GR.OTS.SHOWSERV.MESSAGE.TABLE.
The most recent outage message sent to the NOTIFY distribution list
is saved in WYL.GR.OTS.SHOWSERV.OUTAGES.  A dated version of this
message is appended to WYL.GR.OTS.SHOWSERV.NOTIFY.TABLE.

Every night a job, PRSTATS, is run from the file

                     WYL.GR.OPS.ZEKELIB#PRSTATS

to extract the Prism usage counts using the exec

                     WYL.GR.OPS.LIB#PRISMIT

using the subroutines

             wyl.gr.ops.lib#pr.send (log_date,send_act)
             wyl.gr.ops.lib#pr.dup(dup_actno,send_act)

It saves the Prism stats in wyl.gr.ops.lib#pr.rept so that this
info can be copied into the Ops Daily Status Report Monday thru
Friday.

A BATWYL job, OPS#WEBT, is run nightly from

                    WYL.GR.OPS.ZEKELIB#OPS#WEBT

to get Web Access trans counts from the file

                   WYL.GQ.DBS.SYSLOG.RPC.Dyymmdd

It uses the date saved with the Prism stats to generate the matching
Web Access count data set name.  It saves the count information in
wyl.gr.ops.lib#web.cnt so that this info can be copied into the Ops
Daily Status Report Monday thru Friday.  The job is submitted by
ZEKE Monday thru Friday at 4:00am.  It was originally created by
Meighan McWilliam.


The BATWYL job PR#ALERT is run from

                    wyl.gr.ops.zekelib#pr#alert

and executed the extended exec wyl.gr.ops.lib#pr.alert
to warn if Prism statistics are out of the expected range.
The acceptable response ranges are:

                  % < 5 seconds GE 90% and
                  % < 10 seconds GE 97% and
                  % > 15 seconds LE 1%

Once per day the exec WYL.GR.OTS.SERVICE#STATEXE is run to build
and send the daily status message.  The assembled text is built
into
                 WYL.GR.OTS.SHOWSERV.STATUS.REPORT

There is another version of the status report, an 'executive
summary', sent only when there are problems.  This is the version
with doubled lines (which I think I fixed).  It is saved in
               WYL.GR.OTS.SHOWSERV.STATUS.REPORT.MGR

At the end of STATEXE, mail is sent via EMS as follows:

    1)  If no disturbance is reported,
        send REPORT to (DAILY-STATUS)
        and  REPORT.MGR to (STATUS-MGR,ba.pet@rlg)
    2)  If at least on disturbance is reported,
        send REPORT to (DAILY-STATUS)
        and  REPORT.MGR to (STATUS-MGR,NON-DAILY-STATUS)
