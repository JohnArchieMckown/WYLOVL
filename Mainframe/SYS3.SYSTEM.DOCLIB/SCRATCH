Data set scratching:

Temporary data sets are scratched every morning at 6am (except for
maintenance mornings, when scratch starts earlier.  The scratch job
is initiated by a $TA command set at midnight:

         $TA,T=06.00,'$VS,''S JOB,N=SCRATCH'''

The $TA is set by one of three jobs in SUBMIT under account GW.DSK:
WEEKDAY, SATURDAY, or SUNDAY.

The proc JOB resides in SYS1.PROCLIB and defaults to run jobs from
SYS1.SP.OPERLIB.  The job SCRATCH runs under account GW.DSK and
executes the proc OPSSCR from SYS3.PROCLIB.  This runs the program
SUPSCR from SYS1.LINKLIST.  There is a serious admonition in the
proc not to change the STEPNAME -- I don't know why, but I believe
it.

SUPSCR will scratch data sets on disks listed with //VOLUMExx DD
statements.  It will not scratch those data sets indicated for
exemption in the //EXEMPT DD statement.  On SYSA this list is
currently contained in SYS3.SYSA.SUPSCR.EXEMPT.  This must be a
card format data set.  Each line must start in column 1 and
contain either a data set name or a data set name mask using * as
as a wildcard representing 1 or more unknown characters.
