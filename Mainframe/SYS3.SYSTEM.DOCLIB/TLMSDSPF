To de-install the updated TLMSDSPF SVC, do the following:
in SYS1.LPALIBA, rename IGC0023B to IGC0$23B
                 rename IGC0@23B to IGC0023B
Then IPL.
It may also be necessary to delete any TAPEVOL profiles which were
created.  Use the TSO command
   SEARCH CLASS(TAPEVOL) CLIST('RDEL ' ' CLASS(TAPEVOL)')
to build a dataset gg$uuu.EXEC.RACF.CLIST .  Edit the dataset to
remove undesired delete commands and then on TSO, enter
   EXEC EXEC.RACF.CLIST
to do the deletes.  This is likely to be unnecessary.



Alternatively, if the problem is severe and IPL is not practical,
the module can be replaced with Omegamon.  Do the rename as above,
then go into Omegamon, enter
   /password
respond with the level 3 password.
Then invoke panel
   LDWLPAM
Change the ">" to "-", type IGC0023B over the member name, and type
SYS1.LPALIBA over the dataset name field.  Hit ENTER.  You should
receive a message like "module IGC0023B successfully updated."


Source to the updated TLMSDSPF is currently in
SYS3.TLMS.TEST.SRC(TLMSDSPF).


The following job can be used to do the above mentioned renames in
batch:
//BATCHTSO EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01,DYNAMNBR=10
//SYSTSPRT  DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSIN   DD  *
  PDS 'SYS1.LPALIBA'
    REN IGC0023B IGC0$23B
    REN IGC0@23B IGC0023B
    END
