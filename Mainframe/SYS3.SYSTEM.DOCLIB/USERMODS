OS/390 usermods source library

I've created a new library, SYS2.USERMODS.ASM, for OS/390.
SYS2.USERMODS.ASM contains Stanford-modified or -written source code
for miscellaneous exits and modules.  It is the OS/390 copy of
SYS2.XA.USER.SOURCE.  Whenever a module from SYS2.XA.USER.SOURCE is
needed in OS/390, copy it to this new library, making any mods
needed to source or JCL.  Please copy only needed modules.  The
intention is that when OS/390 goes production, we will have a
current library of source mods here.

I've moved ICHNCV00, the RACF dsname conversion module, into this
library and installed it in SYS1.LPALIBE.

Continued below.

              Where to Find Stanford Local System Code


MVS exits, SVCs, usermods, and similarly integral parts
will be stored as appropriate in:

      SYS3.USERMODS.SOURCE
      SYS3.USERMODS.OBJECT
      SYS3.USERMODS.LINKLIB
      SYS3.USERMODS.JCL

Each production member will be named using the standard name
of the object being named.  The same name will be used in all
four libraries if there are objects in all four.  JCL to
assemble and link the objects will normally be stored in the
JCL library.  These objects will not normally have JCL other
than that to build them.  Backup members of these libraries
will be named by appending/changing characters of the
programmer's choice on the right.  Text members will be stored
using WYLBUR with titles attached identifying the version/
release/date/etc as appropriate.

For local utility programs, source and the JCL to compile and
link the load modules and, if appropriate, sample run JCL
will be stored as appropriate in:

      SYS3.SYSTEM.SOURCE
      SYS3.SYSTEM.JCL

Library member names will follow the convention for system
components as much as possible.  These members should also
be stored using WYLBUR with titles attached for documentation.
