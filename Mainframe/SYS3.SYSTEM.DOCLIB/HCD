Until we get the new release of HCD installed (which I just
emailed John to have it ordered), to use HCD, enter HCDINIT
at READY and then enter ISPF and select HCD (S.H).  HCDINIT
allocates SYS1.NUCLEUS to ISPLLIB, which must be done outside
of ISPF.

Using ISPF with ISPLLIB is a performance hit, so we don't want
to have ISPLLIB allocated under normal conditions.
