SHOW TAPE TYPE spec                M. Lawrence             1998/06/22

SHOW TAPE TYPE returns a single record describing a tape series.  The argument
is a tape number.  This call does not return any information about the
specific tape number, so no security restrictions apply.  Rather, it returns
generic information about the tape series of which the tape number is a
member, or an indication that the tape number does not belong to any series
known to TLMS.

The format of the information is:

....v....1....v....2....v....3....v....4....v....5....v....6....v....7..

SHOW (or DUMP) TAPE ... TYPE can be used to verify that a tape number is
"plausible" -- that is, that it is syntactically valid, and belongs to a
series that exists in TLMS on some Stanford computer.  It can also be used to
determine which computer that is.  Thus SHOW TAPE G12345 TYPE returns

             ....v....1....v....2....v....3....v....4....v....5
             S31N9SB   RLG scratch 3490E

So, this is a Scratch tape (col. 1=S), is used on 3490E drives (col. 5=9), and
is used on SYSB (col. 7=B).  The "description" field says essentially the same
thing, but the contents of cols. 1-7 are better suited to being parsed by an
execfile.

Note that this call does NOT verify that the particular tape number given
actually is in service, or even in the TLMS data base.  Thus, for example, if
tapes F00000 thru F20000 are defined on SYSA, SHOW TAPE F99999 TYPE will still
return "valid" information.  Verification of a specific tape number requires
looking up the specific tape in the database; that can be done only on the
machine that "owns" the tape and is subject to the security restrictions of
SHOW TAPE.
