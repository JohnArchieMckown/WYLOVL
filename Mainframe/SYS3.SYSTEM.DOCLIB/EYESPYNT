                           EYE-SPY Notes


Currently EYE-SPY is installed and active on SYSA/D/H.

EYE-SPY has a separate address space which monitors task
abends and decides whether to intercept and produce an EYE-SPY in
place of the expected SYSUDUMP or SYSABEND.

EYESPY supports both OLD COBOL, PGM=IKJCBL00, and the newer versions
with PGM=IGYCRCTL.

For PGM=IKJCBL00, the user is responsible for maintaining the source
in a PDS with DCB=(LRECL=121,RECFM=FBA,BLKSIZE=(121*X)).

For PGM=ICYCRCTL, the user can specify, (DEFAULT), for EYESPY to
maintain the source dynamically in VSAM datasets, or specify the PDS
for the source to be maintained by the user, in which case it must
have DCB=(LRECL=133,RECFM=FBA,BLKSIZE=(133*X)).

Please note, that for PGM=IKJCBL00 the use of the PDS is mandatory;
for PGM=ICYCRCTL, it is optional. See SYS3.PROCLIB(ISPYPDS) for
sample JCL to be used for the PDS option.

To let EYESPY maintain the source, the user is responsible to
define the DBKF VSAM dataset, the EYESPY directory data base for the
source programs. All source programs must have unique names(just
like PDS MEMBERS). See SYS2.EYESPY.PROD.JCLLIB(ISPYDBKF), or
SYS3.PROCLIB(ISPYDBKF) for sample JCL.  The ISPYDBKF job is to be
run once only per user or account.  The initial space allocation of
cyl(1 1) is sufficient(VSAM ALLOWS 123 secondary extents).  Change
it only if it has to be reallocated for additional extents.

Please see the instructions in SYS3.PROCLIB member ISPYPDS or
ISPYDBKF, pertaining to step override specifications.

The EYESPY production datasets have the prefix SYS2.EYESPY.PROD.
