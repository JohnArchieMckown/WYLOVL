Dear People:

The following procedure may be used to determine the correct
LIBRARY(member) in the PARMLIB concatenation to update:

ON THE SYSTEM TO BE UPDATED: issue 'D IPLINFO'

LINES SIMILAR TO THE FOLLOWING WILL APPEAR:


08.52.34           IEE254I  08.52.34 IPLINFO DISPLAY 823
 SYSTEM IPLED AT 07.04.44 ON 02/09/2002
 RELEASE OS/390 02.08.00
 USED LOAD28 IN SYS1.IPLPARM ON 0E4E  *** NOTE THIS ONE ***
 IEASYM LIST = NONE
 IEASYS LIST = 28 (OP)  *** NOTE THIS ONE ***
 IODF DEVICE 0E4E
 IPL DEVICE 0EF5 VOLUME OS028C

BROWSE, not edit, SYS1.IPLPARM(LOAD28) per above.

The PARMLIB statements within LOAD__ define the
PARMLIB CONCATENATION.

The SYSPARM statement defines the IEASYS__ members to use to
specify their corresponding parameters.

In this case:

PARMLIB  SYS1.PARMLIB.SYSA
PARMLIB  SYS1.PARMLIB.CPACV28
PARMLIB  SYS1.PARMLIB
SYSPARM  28


Per above, the 1st IEASYS28 member found in:
SYS1.PARMLIB.SYSA
SYS1.PARMLIB.CPACV28
SYS1.PARMLIB

determines the PARMLIB member names to use for their
corresponding parameters.

IEASYS28 in SYS1.PARMLIB.SYSA is used.

For PROG__ member, IEASYS28 contains PROG=28, so the 1st
PROG28 member found in the concatenation is used.

PROG28 is in SYS1.PARMLIB.SYSA.

So, if the LNKLST, LPA SYSLIB or APF specs needs to be
updated, SYS1.PARMLIB.SYSA(PROG28) is the LIBRARY(member) to
update.
