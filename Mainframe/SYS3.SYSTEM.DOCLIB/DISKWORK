This documentation was created as a general reference for disk
related activities.  It is geared at the level of someone who is
already familiar with ICKDSF, DFDSS, JCL etc.  It is also based on
current practices, methods and information relating to disk.
Much of this same information is also in WORD documentation form on:

  NTapple/Operations/DiskOncallDocs/Word Docs/Procedure/Sysprocs.doc

 I.
   A. The most common accounts used for disk support staff (mainframe) are:

       GW.DSK, GR.OTS, GW.TAP, GR.UNI, GR.OPS, GW.LIB, GG.ORV, GS.AOP


   These accounts contain JCL, execs, data input files, etc. for specific
   areas of activity (tape, disk, print, EREP, etc.)  Below is a brief
   description of what each account/library within account contains. It may
   help when you eventually have to look for jcl or have to modify execs
   in the future.

  B.  ZEKE Libraries (ZEKELIB)

   Any account which is currently scheduling jobs via ZEKE contains a
   ZEKE JCL library we choose to call ZEKELIB in each account.  It is
   a requirement of ZEKE that these libraries be fixed 80 column
   PDS.

   Do a 'sho dir in zekelib' for any given account to view what jobs are
   being scheduled by ZEKE.

 II. Available DEFINES under GW.DSK:
     --------------------------------


   1.ANALYZE - exe fro WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB#ANLZEXEC clr...

      This is used to automate the submission of an ANALYZE
      on a disk volume.

   2.CHECK - xc WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB#DSKCHECK /...


      This define calls an extended exec which is used as an
      automated tool for preliminary diagnostics on a disk that
      may have correctable or uncorrectable data checks being report
      in LOGREC.  The exec will prompt you for disk and run time
      criteria information.  The job itself will run ANALYZE.
      If errors are found, it will submit ANALYZE again.  The
      max number of times ANALYZE will run is three.  If on the
      third ANALYZE errors still exist, it will launch another
      job which will run a job called DSKFIXUP which runs an
      INSPECT against the defective tracks.

   3.CLIP - exe fro WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB#CLIPEXEC clr...

      This is used to automate the submission of a clip (aka REFORMAT)
      on a disk.  Volume must be offline to the system for the clip
      to complete successfully.

   4.DM - xc wyl.gw.dsk.disklib#dmexec /...

       This defines is a quick way of running a diskmap against a
       volume.  Type in --> DM [volume name] and the job is immediately
       submitted.

   5.DSBACKUP - exe fro WYL.GW.DSK.LIBX#DSBACKUP parm=(...) clr

       This define will list the backup schedule for Non-orvyl volumes
       according to the day you request.

   6.DSBSKED - exec from wyl.gw.dsk.libx#dsbackup parm=(schedule /,sysa,
               volgroup=4, backup)...

       This define will take information in WYL.GW.DSK.NEWFILE (SYSA) and
       arrange it in table form.  It is used most frequently to update the
       publicly accessible dataset WYL.GW.DSK.BACKUP.SCHEDULE.  Every time a
       new MVS type volume is added, this dataset needs to be updated.

   7. FIXUP - xc WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB#DSKFIXUP /...

       In the event an ANALYZE was submitted not using the CHECK define,
       this define can be used to submit an INSPECT using the track
       information found in the ANALYZE job.  The exec will prompt you
       for the ANALYZE job number in the system.

   8.IO - xc WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB#UCBLIST...

       This define will take UCB information for disk and format it into a
       printable report that lists disk strings, volume names and device types.

   9.MAINT - exe fro WYL.GW.DSK.LIBX#XSUBMITA parm=(...) clr

        This define is used to determine what MVS backups are scheduled to be
        submitted each day.  It takes information from NEWFILE (SYSA) or
        NEWFILEB (RLG), creates the JCL and places it in your active file.
        This exec is issued nightly (automatically thru a ZEKE scheduled
        job) to submit the backups. It can also be performed manually when
        needed.

   10.MAP - exe fro WYL.GW.DSK.LIBX#MVSRXTOR parm=(...,MAP) clr

         This define will run a job that will run a job to produce a VTOC
         listing from an MVS backup.  The exec will prompt you for the
         volume you want the listing for.

   11.MOVE - exe fro WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB#EXECMOVE parm=(...) clr

         We use this define most frequently when doing full volume moves.
         It will prompt you for the SOURCE and TARGET volume and then placed the
         JCL it created into your active file. You can then review it once
         more before submission

   12.RESTORE - exe fro WYL.GW.DSK.LIBX#MVSRXTOR parm=(...) clr

          This is the define we use to begin the exec for restoring
          MVS datasets.  It will prompt you for the volume you want to
          restore from, the dataset you want to restore and the volume
          you want to it to.  When done, it will place the JCL in your
          active file and give you the opportunity to modify it if
          necessary.  The job itself will, if restore is successful,
          send email to the owner account and GR.OTS.

 III. Disk Activities:

   Note:  There is an Excel document that is available as a checksheet for
   the following items (if you want a hardcopy record of what you did) and
   it can be found at:

     NTapple/Operations/DiskOncallDocs/ExcelDocs/DiskChecklst.xls


   A. Adding Volumes Checklist:
      ---------------

   The following activities should be consistently done when adding a volume:

     For Wylbur / Non SMS volumes:
       .Submitting a CHANGE notice to the manager
       .Initializing volume with correct VTOC and IXVTOC size
       .Adding volume to wylbur table WYL.GS.WYL.LIB#(WVOLSYSA/WVOLSYSB)
       .Adding volume to backup table WYL.GW.DSK.(NEWFILE/NEWFILEB) (if applies)
       .Updating the public backup schedule WYL.GW.DSK.BACKUP.SCHEDULE (SYSA)
       .Varying volumes online to wylburs

     For Orvyl volumes:
       .Submitting CHANGE notice to manager
       .Initializing/Formatting volume
       .Updating definition table
          WYL.GG.ORV.(ALPHA.STREAM/BETA.STREAM)#(file system name)
       .Adding new file segment for backups; use WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB#NEWSEG
       .Updating the WYL.GW.DSK.RESTORE#[FILESYS] jcl
       .Updating the SYS3.BETAPROC#READBACK jcl (for SYSB)
       .Updating WYL.GG.ORV.RESTORE#FILEREST when new segments are added

    For SMS managed Volumes:
       Follow procedures found in wyl.ga.mcl.sms.lib#addvol or go to the
       NTapple/OPERATIONS/DISKONCALL/WORDDOCS/SYSPROCS  WORD document that
       has a procedure about adding SMS managed volumes.

   C. De-Allocating Volumes from Wylburs: (WYLBUR,TESTWYL,DEVWYL,SERVWYL,etc.)
      -----------------------------------
     The operator command used to check allocation on a disk is 'd u,,alloc,nnn,
     where 'nnn' is the unit address.

    1. Logon to a WYLBUR session under GW.DSK
    2. Vary volume offline from wylbur.  Type in 'vary VOLSER,offline
    3. To logon to TESTWYL from WYLBUR, type in 'subsys TESTWYL'
    4. Complete the usual logon process.
    5. Repeat step 2 only this time for TESTWYL
    6. Repeat steps 2 thru 4 for each of the remaining subsystems
       (ie. SERVYWL, DEVWYL,VISTA,SQLWYL). If a volume is not allocated
       to all subsystems, only perform this routine for the subsystem
       necessary.


   D.  Volume Copies/Moves: (Non-Systems, Non-VSAM and Non-Orvyl volumes)
       -------------------

      ***The use of this information below is nill with the implementation  of
      RAID-S and mirrored disk but it will be left here until we decide to
      remove it.

      There is an exec we use to move disk volume to volume.  Under account
      GW.DSK, simply type in the define 'MOVE' and it will prompt you for
      the SOURCE volume and the TARGET volume.  It will set up the JCL and
      place it in your active file.

      This particular JCL is set up so that:
           .SOURCE volume is first taken offline and clipped to OLDxxx
           .SOURCE is placed back online to the system
           .OLDxxx is then copied to the TARGET volume (usually labeled NEWxxx)
           .if copy is successful, the TARGET volume is placed offline
            and clipped  to original SOURCE volume name.
           .the TARGET volume is placed back online to the system.

       Please note that before all this can take place, the SOURCE volume
       must be de-allocated from all the subsystems it is allocated to.
       Once this is done, the above method of moving the data ensures
       that the volume will not be written to during the move.

       Following successful completion of the move, the volume must be
       varied online to all the wylburs and/or subsystems it was
       associated with.

       Several reminder items:

           .Before starting the move of data, have Operations staff
            broadcast a message to the public as to what volume will
            be unavailable and for how long.

           .check to see how the volume is mounted before moving.
            You may have to modify the last step in the jcl to
            make sure the mount attribute is correct.

           .If the volume being moved is an IBM 3380/3390 volume that
            is non-RAID or non-mirrored, the sister volume  must
            be moved also in the event there is an HDA which needs
            replacement.  Amdahl volumes do not share an HDA so this
            rule does not apply to them.


       Volume Copies/Moves:  (Orvyl volumes)
       --------------------

        The same define 'MOVE' under GW.DSK can be used for moving Orvyl
        volumes.  Orvyl must be brought down in order to do the move.

        Following an Orvyl volume move, a file system verify should
        be run on the file system affected before starting Orvyl.The
        operators have the procedure for running verifies for each
        file system on both SYSA/SYSB.  They will issue the command at
        the console.

        It is possible to submit the verify on the file system yourself,
        provided you are on a system that has Control-O running and you also
        have an active TSO console session. You can simply type in
        the command ---> /verify FILENAME

        Upon successful completion (a message appears on the operator
        console), Orvyl can be started.





   F. Backup schedules:
      --------------------------------------------------

     Non-Orvyl volumes:

      SYSA:  WYL.GW.DSK.NEWFILE contains all the non-orvyl volumes
             and related information about the volumes. Volume are
             backed up on a weekly basis between Saturday and Wednesday
             with carryover to the following day in the event of
             backup failure.

          ** This dataset is used by a number of execs (ie. dataset
             restores, creation of WYL.GW.DSK.BACKUP.SCHEDULE, resubmission
             of backups by operators,etc.) and reports (SAS reports on request,
             Disaster recovery info,etc.)

             WYL.GW.DSK.BACKUP.SCHEDULE contains the exact backup time
             and day for each volume.  This is a publicly accessed
             dataset.

      SYSB:  WYL.GW.DSK.NEWFILEB  contains all the non-orvyl volumes
             and related information about those volumes for weekly
             backups on Sunday morning, 01:00


     Orvyl Volumes:

      SYSA:  WYL.GS.ORV.ZEKELIB is the library that contains all the JCL
             for running SYSA file system dumps.  A job called ORVSETV which
             can be found in wyl.gs.orv.zekelib#orvsetv runs every day after
             midnite and resets the 'start time' variables.  These variables
             get passed into the JCL when ZEKE submits the job for execution
             The JCL itself is imbedded with this one variable, start time.
             If you want to switch the start times for the orvyl backups,
             modify the variable information in ORVSETV.  All orvyl dumps
             are dependent on the successful completion of ORVSETV.

             As of 5/99, all the ORVYL dumps (except FOLIO and SDCACCT) are
             using the EMC BCV disks in the dump process.  All incremental
             and full dump jobs in ZEKE are dependent on the successful
             completion of the 'SPLIT' portion of the file system backups.
             All the JCL for dumps, whether the SPLIT, INC or DUMP, are
             located in WYL.GS.ORV.ZEKELIB.

             The overall schedule for the ORVYL dumps can still be found
             in WYL.GG.ORV.ALPHA.STREAM#ORVDUMP (sysa) or on SYSB at
             WYL.GG.ORV.BETA.STREAM#ORVDUMP.


      SYSB:  WYL.GG.ORV.BETA.STREAM#RLGDUMP contains the schedule for
             all SYSB file system backups.  Orvyl backups for RLG file
             systems are scheduled by RLG staff at present.


   G. Moving a volume allocated to the CATALOG:
      ----------------------------------------

   Most often, volumes that are allocated to the catalog are only moved during
   systems time.  There are some occasions where, in coordination with the
   client affected, a volume can be de-allocated from the catalog in use and
   moved during production hours.  This documentation will not describe how
   to make that decision but how to de-allocate from the catalog when ready
   to move the volume.

   1. To determine the catalog name for the volume type:

       --->  F CATALOG,OPEN[volser]  (where 'volser' is the volume name)

   2. When ready to move the volume, a 'lock' must be done to the
      catalog to keep users from accessing the volume catalog.  Using the
      GW.DSK account:

       --->  USE DISKLIB#LOCK

       > modify the jcl to insert the catalog name

       --->  RUN UNN HOLD

      (those with system privileges can run this job without logging onto
       GW.DSK)

   3. On the operator console, type the following command:

       --->  F CATALOG,UNALLOCATE(CATALOG.cccccc)

        'cccccc' stands for the name of the catalog determined in step 1.

       ----> F CATALOG,VCLOSE(vvvvvv)

        'vvvvvv' stands for the volume name

   4.  To check if the catalog entry has been de-allocated and closed, at
       the operator console type:

        ---->  F CATALOG,OPEN

       The absence of an entry name indicates the volume has been de-allocated
       and closed.



   Allocating a volume to the catalog:
   -----------------------------------

   After moving a volume that was de-allocated from the catalog, it must be
   allocated to the catalog again.  To do this, do the following:

   1. At the operator console, type the command to open the catalog entry:

         ---->  F CATALOG,VOPEN(vvvvvv)

       'vvvvvv' stands for the volume name

   2. Type in the next command to allocate the catalog entry:

        ---->  F CATALOG,ALLOCATE(CATALOG.cccccc)

      'cccccc' stands for the assigned catalog name

   3.  Run the job that unlocks the catalog:

        ---->  USE DISKLIB#LOCK

       > modify the JCL to insert the catalog name
       > change 'LOCK' to 'UNLOCK'

        ---->  RUN UNN HOLD

   4.  At the operator console, check to see if the catalog entry is
       open and allocated.  Type in the command:

        -----> F CATALOG,OPEN

       A 'Y' indicates the volume is allocated.

       (it may be necessary to perform a save against the volume before
        the 'Y' will appear)


   5.  Before finishing, check all mount attributes and allocations to
       make sure that the volume has the same attributes as it did
       before the move.

  H. Data Set Restores:
  __________________

  The utility UTIL RECOVER is an exec that was created for the client to submit
  request for a data set restore.  Although it needs modifications made to it
  since we implemented SMS, it remains the method by which we receive requests.
  All requests are mailed to account GR.OTS.

  The 'Restore' request contains information about restore date, client
  information (account, phone info, source volume, dataset to restore and if
  renaming, new dataset name).  The 'source' volume comes from either the client
  or is the exec's best guess' at determining the source.  With SMS volumes, it
  irrelevant information but with client specific volumes (like RLG and NOTIS
  clients using the LIB volumes) it is useful information.

  The define called 'RESTORE' can be used from the GW.DSK to call the restore ex
  which is WYL.GW.DSK.LIBX#MVSRXTOR. In 1996 we implemented the use of TOSS to
  manage the offsite rotation and Autoscratch to manage the releasing of dump
  tapes.  Dump tapes created prior to 12/9/96 on SYSA and 10/27/96 on SYSB were
  not cataloged and have a different naming convention on the tape label. The
  RESTORE exec is set up to call the old standard exec in LIBX#MVSRXTOR and by
  giving it your restore date, determines whether to use the old standard exec
  or a new extended exec to deal with the restore. The new extended exec
  has instructions included.  It will require that you provide information about
  whether the tape is a weekly or monthly tape (as denoted by day of the month i
  was generated) and to determine the generation of the tape (0,-1,-2, etc.)
  JCL will be constructed accordingly.

  Determining what backup tape to use for a data set restore:
  ----------------------------------------------------------

  ZEKE schedules a job called DSKCLEAN to run Saturday thru Wednesday.  It takes
  snapshot of the VTOC for all MVS volumes as they look at 4am.  The output date
  WYL.GW.DSK.DSNLIST.DTmmdd (where mm is current month and dd is current day) is
  saved on disk until Friday of each week.  On Friday, the current weeks dsnlist
  are written to tape with the cataloged dataset of WYL.GW.DSK.DSNLIST.TAPE.DTmm
  It may be required that you dump the dataset(s) back to disk for the day(s)
  close to the restore date in order to find where the dataset resided at that
  point in time.  You can use the jcl WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB#TAP2DSK2 to restore the
  datasets back to disk temporarily.  You will also have to refer to
  WYL.GW.DSK.BACKUP.SCHEDULE to match the dataset volume location with the backu
  schedule for the volume.  If the restore data set is SMS managed, it is possib
  that it may have moved to different volume.

  I. Jes Spool Offload and Restore for SYSA
     --------------------------------------

   This JES spool offload procedure is performed normally in preparation for
   planned power outage that require disk to be powered down (to include the
   JESA01 spool volume).The SYSA JES spool dataset is SYS1.HASPACE.  Just as
   an additional note in the event this information is needed, the JES check-
   point dataset is located on JESAC1 and is named SYS1.HASPCKPT.

   . Preparing for JES spool offload:

  1. Initialize a 3390-3 with a 1 track vtoc and allocate the dataset
     SYS3.JES.OFFLOAD on it.  Use WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB#INIT jcl as a template
     to initialize the volume and WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB#ALLOCJES to allocate
     the dataset.   The jcl should be set up to allocate the whole pack
     with this one dataset.  Name the volume JESDMP.

  2. Check the status of the 'SYS3.JES.OFFLOAD' dataset as well as the status
     of the sysout transmitter (OFF1.ST) and job transmitter (OFF1.JT).  Use
     the following commands at the console:

      >  $DU,OFF.ST1       (displays status of sysout transmitter)
      >  $DU,OFF.JT1       (displays status of job transmitter)
      >  $DU,OFFLOAD1      (displays status of offload dataset)


     The status of any of these would say 'STATUS=DRAINED' when not in use.
     Otherwise it would say 'STATUS=ACTIVE' when jobs are actively off-
     loading or 'STATUS=INACTIVE' when there is no activity during an off-
     load process.   If the sysout and job transmitters have been started
     prior to the starting of the offload process, the status will say
     'STATUS=STARTABLE' meaning it is waiting for the offload process
     ($S OFFLOAD1,TYPE=TRANSMIT) to be started.



   . Beginning the OFFLOAD process

   1. If any of these are in a 'drained' state, they will need to be started
      up.  Although not mandatory, I would start the transmitters first before
      entering the '$S OFFLOAD1' command.

      Use the folowing commands to startup the process:

      >  $S OFF1.ST                      (starts the sysout transmitter)
      >  $S OFF1.JT                      (starts the job transmitter)
      >  $S OFFLOAD1,TYPE=TRANSMIT       (starts the offload process)

    When all jobs have 'dumped' to the SYS3.JES.OFFLOAD dataset on JESDMP,
    the status of the transmitters and OFFLOAD will show as 'inactive'.  If
    you do a 'locate you will see jobs with the comment 'DUMPED' to the side.
    TSU and STC jobs a not going to show this status because they are
    intentionally excluded from the  OFFLOAD process so you will not see that
    comment next to them.

    When it is time to stop the OFFLOAD process and backup the JESDMP volume,
    type in the command:

      >  $P OFFLOAD1

    The status of the OFFLOAD dataset ($DU,OFFLOAD1) should display as
    'STATUS=DRAINED' before beginning the full volume backup of JESDMP.

   2. Perform a full volume dump of JESDMP to tape prior to system shutdown.
      Using WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB#DUMP jcl as a template and make the necessary
      modifications.  Submit the job. (This process takes about 15 minutes
      for a 3390-3)

      Once the backup is complete, systems maintenance work can begin as
      scheduled



  . Restoring Scenarios
    -----------------------------

   Scenario 1:  JES spool volume (JESA01) needs restoring and JESDMP volume need
   restoring.

   If both volumes that the JES spool is on and the volume to which the OFFLOAD
   dataset resides need restoring:

   1. Perform full volumes restores for JESA01 and JESDMP using the jcl template
      found in WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB#RESTORE.

   2. Modify the jcl as needed to specify volume names and unit addresses, etc.
      On the JESDMP volume, make sure the 'CATALOG' keyword in included in the
      full volume restore process to satisfy the cataloging requirements for
      SYS3.JES.OFFLOAD when restoring the spool.

   3. Begin the 'RELOAD' process from disk  (see instructions below)


  Scenario 2:  JESA01 volume needs restoring but JESDMP volume does not.

   1. Perform full volume restore of JESA01.

   2. BEgin the 'RELOAD' process from disk (JESDMP) using instructions below.


  . Reloading the OFFLOAD dataset
  -------------------------------------


   Once the work has been completed for either scenario 1 or scenario 2, proceed
   with the reloading of the JES spool as follows:  (Note - the OFFLOAD command
   is used for both offloading and reloading).

   1. Using the display commands noted at the beginning of this document, check
      the status of the SYS3.JES.OFFLOAD dataset as well as the receivers
      (OFF1.SR and OFF1.JR).  If the receivers are in a 'DRAINED' state, start
      them by using the commands:

      >  $S OFF1.JR
      >  $S OFF1.SR

    Once the status of the receivers display as 'STATUS=STARTABLE' start the
    RELOAD process by typing in the command:

      >  $S OFFLOAD1,TYPE=RECEIVE

    When the process is complete, the status of the receivers will show as
    'STATUS=INACTIVE'. Drain the SYS3.JES.OFFLOAD dataset, the transmitters and
    receivers by issuing the commands:

      >  $P OFFLOAD1
      >  $P OFF1.SR
      >  $P OFF1.JR


    J. Submitting backups manually from the Console:

     MVS Backups:

     To submit an single  backup manually from the operator console, you can use
     command:   'MVSDUMP [volume]'  with [volume] being the individual volume na
     want to backup.

     To submit or resubmit all the backups for a day, use  'S OPSRDR,NAME='DMAIN
     logon to GW.DSK and type in the 'MAINT'  define to activate the exec.

     * Note: MVSDUMP is a ZACK command and ZACK and ZEKE must be active for the
     commands to work.  If they can't be activated, resort to using the old comm
     mentioned above.
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     ORVYL backups:

     To manually submit an Orvyl full dump at the console, type in 'ORVDUMP [fs]
     where [fs] is the file system name.  Valid file system names are FIS, NSI,
     OOD, ROUTE66, ITS, SOCRATES and SDCACCT.

     To manually submit or resubmit an Orvyl incremental backup at the console,
     'ORVDUMP [fs]INC'  where [fs] is the file system name.  See valid file syst
     above.

     To manually submit or resubmit and Orvyl disk to tape job at the console, t
     'ORVDUMP [fs]2TAPE'  where [fs] is the file system name.   See valid file s
     names listed above.

     * Note: ORVDUMPis a ZACK command and ZACK and ZEKE must be active for the
     commands to work.   If unable to activate ZEKE/ZACK, use and modify the JCL
     each file system. The JCL is located in the WYL.GS.ORV.ZEKELIB  library.  M
     a few mods to replace any ZEKE variables beginning with '$' to some valid v
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     To submit a VERIFY for a single file system at the console, type in the com
     'VERIFY  [fs]'  where [fs] is the file system name.

     To submit a VERIFY for all file systems at the console, type in the command
     'VERIFY ORVFILES'.


     * Note: VERIFY is a ZACK command and ZACK and ZEKE must be active for the
     commands to work.  The underlying proc used by ZACK to submit the verifies
     'S ORV_VFY,TYPE=MAN,OPT='[FS] VRFY'

  IV.  Client Service Profiles Relating to Disk


     SYSA:  Scheduled volume moves occur during weekend system blocks
            unless the client group using the volume schedules movement
            during non-peak hours.

            If errors are reported thru LOGREC, ANALYZE can be run on the
            volume first.  Based on the information found in the output,
            you decide the course of action to take.

            Info Access Clients: We provide service to this client Monday
            thru Friday, 8-5pm.  Work provided to this client during
            off hours (ie. non dayshift, weekends, holidays) should be
            limited to 1st level diagnosis of the problem and removal of
            the affected file system from Orvyl (if necessary). All
            volume moves, repairs, etc. are to be done during service hours.
            Info Access clients (oncall staff) should be notified if a part of
            the Info Access file system is taken out of service.

     SYSB:  RLG's policy requires that we attempt to move data asap when we
            encounter any serious media/hardware (ie. data checks, equip.
            checks) related errors at the console.

            When the errors in LOCGREC are Controller/Control unit related,
            communicate this information to the associated vendor during
            day hours.  It is not necessary to call the RLG 1st on call in
            this situation.

            If problem is hardware related and data is unmovable, explore the
            recovery options (ie. restoring of a file system, waiting for
            vendor to arrive/repair, etc.) with the 1st on call person.

            Of course, RLG 1st on call always needs to be contacted and consulte
            with (if situation allows the time to do this) prior to taking actio
            that would require moving data.

   V.   Disaster Recovery and Disk
        --------------------------

        We have several means by which we save information about disk
        backups for both Orvyl and Non-Orvyl disks.

        1. FBACKUP is a job submitted by ZEKE (jcl member is
           WYL.GW.DSK.ZEKELIB#FBACKUP) which gathers backup information
           from NEWFILE & NEWFILEB  and saves it onto Jose's hard drive
           nightly.

        2. MVSTAPES is a job submitted by ZEKE daily (jcl member is
           WYL.GP.DRP.CTMLIB#MVSTAPES) and saves the same
           information as above on LINDY temporarily until it is passe
           to one of the Sweet Hall servers as backup.  Procedure for
           accessing this file is listed below.  The file on Lindy is
           '~drp/DRP/sysa.rlg.newfiles' and is only accessible by the
           Disaster Recovery representative.

        3. ORVTAPES is another job submitted by ZEKE daily (jcl
           member is WYL.GP.DRP.CTMLIB#ORVTAPES) and saves
           Orvyl backup tape information from the last 3 months onto
           LINDY temporarily before it is passed on to one of the Sweet Hall
           servers for backup.  The file on Lindy is '~drp/DRP/sysa.orvyl.bak.ta
           and is only accessible on LINDY by the Disaster Recovery
           representative.


         To access the MVSTAPES and ORVTAPES files on the Sweet Hall servers,

         > establish a telnet session
         > enter 'Sparc20-best' as your host (this will give you any of the Elai
                                               at Sweet Hall)
         > identify yourself with your SUNET ID.
         > Once login estabished, enter:
             cd  /afs/ir.Stanford.edu/group/FDR    (hit return)
             ls   (hit return; this will list all files in this directory)
           To read the actual files, you have several choices of unix commands:

          type     'less [file name]' **
          or       'more [file name]'
          or       'cat [file name]'


          For example:   'less sysa.rlg.newfiles'   will list for you
           all the MVS dump tapes in the backup definition table from SYSA.
          When done, type Q to end the listing.

         You should all have read and lookup access to these files that are
         on the Sweet Hall servers.
         information will most likely change in the near future but for now,
         this is how it is all done and where the files reside.

     **   You may not be able to use 'less' from your session unless you
          specify the path.  The command 'more' however, is usually
          available without setting any path first.  See Unix command
          descriptions for differences between using 'less' and 'more'.

     **   To use the unix command 'less', set your path first by entering
          'set path = (/usr/pubsw/bin $path)'  This will only temporarily
          allow your session to use the 'less' command.  When you logoff,
          your previous session defaults will be back in place.
