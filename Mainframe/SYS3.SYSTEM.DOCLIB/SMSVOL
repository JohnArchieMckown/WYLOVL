ADDING A VOLUME=============================================================

Summary of adding a volume to SMS storage pool procedures.  Look in SMS.LIB
for similar names, e.g. #I#STR001, referring to specific volumes.  The summary
below shows specifically how STR201 was added, but includes references to
generic JCL files such as #I#STR2nn.

Specific task was:  add vol to "medium" storage group (STORGRP=STD$MED),
volumes STR200, 201, etc., which had only STR200 so far.

1.  Obtain a volume.  In this case, volume was NEW42F, unit 42F.  Do SHOW UCB
    on unit address (or equivalent console cmd), confirm volser and status.
    Do disklook on vol (acc=all), confirm empty or only spacehogs (DISKLOOK
    also confirms unit address).

    To search for a volume, you can run a job like this:

     // JOB
     // EXEC DISKLOOK,VOL=NEW,ACC=ALL,OPTION='FREE,NOPRINT,TERM'
     //SYSTERM DD SYSOUT=A

    This job will produce a brief report on all NEWxxx disk volumes, and show
    their size.  It will also show any datasets that may be stored on them.
    Normally you should discuss the choice of a volume with PJG.

    *  WARNING!  The init job will destroy all datasets on the volume,     *
    *  bypassing all security.  Be very, very sure that nothing useful     *
    *  is on the volume.                                                   *
    *                                                                      *

2.  Scratch space-holder datasets on chosen volume.  Not necessary if they
    aren't cataloged.

3.  Confirm that volume is not allocated by any tasks on SYSA or SYSD.  If
    volume is being recycled (e.g. former PUB volume), it will be necessary to
    vary if offline to all WYLBURs on both SYSA and SYSD.  This is done by
    VARY vvvvvv,OFFLINE in each subsystem.  BATWYL jobs may be used to do
    this.

    XC WYL.GA.MCL.XPROC#ALLWYL/VARY vvvvvv,offline will submit a batwyl job to
    vary the volume offline to all SYSA WYLBURs.

4.  SYSD OS V uuu,OFFLINE  then check vol status on SYSD to be sure it's off.

5.  WYL.GA.MCL.SMS.LIB contains jcl to relabel and init small, med, large
    vols.  These are I#STR0nn for small, I#STR2nn for medium, I#STR4nn for
    large.  Unit, old volser, and new volser need be changed (do global
    change, they appear multiple times).  This JCL is now set up to do both
    the init and the VVDS in one job.

6.  SYSD OS V uuu,ONLINE

7.  Verify by running DISKLOOK on it, or otherwise verify it's online and
    has proper volser, VTOC size, etc.

8.  Go into ISMF, option 6 (storage group), add vol to current SCDS which is
    SMS.TEST.SCDS (D SMS on console would indicate which is active).  If the
    volume is already defined to the SCDS, change its status from NOTCON to
    ENABLED.  If you don't want it to be available yet, change the status from
    NOTCON to DISNEW.  The status DISNEW will prevent any new datasets being
    allocated on it, but will allow "volume DD" type allocations (e.g. disk
    accounting, TSO VTOC command).  Do not leave a volume online with status
    NOTCON; "volume DD" type allocations will fail, which could disrupt disk
    accounting and other jobs.

    You can't modify "ACTIVE" (note the distinction between "ACTIVE" and the
    active SCDS).  You have to modify an SCDS, then activate it; be careful
    that doing so doesn't bring in unanticipated changes.  You want to start
    with an SCDS that matches the currently active one -- this might be PROD.

    You can add a group of volumes to the definitions by using the "prefix",
    "from", and "to" fields on the volume definition panel.  You can see what
    volumes are already defined by choosing "SMS" as the source when doing
    a volume display and indicating "online or offline".

10. ISMF panel 8 (control dataset), "activate" updated SCDS.  Can also do from
    console:

         SETSMS SCDS(SMS.TEST.SCDS)

    ************************************************************************
    *                                                                      *
    *  Activating the wrong SCDS will install and activate the wrong       *
    *  version of SMS, including ACS routines and volume definitions.      *
    *  This will have the effect of backing out recent changes, or         *
    *  perhaps installing new and untested code.                           *
    *                                                                      *
    ************************************************************************

    To undo a mistaken activation, do SETSMS ACDS to reactivate a previously
    saved ACDS.  Make sure you know which one is the proper backup BEFORE
    doing an activation.

    In the worst case, improper activation of a bad configuration can cause
    most dataset allocation attempts, both batch and WYLBUR, to fail.

11. If you just added the volume to the storage group, go to ISMF panel 2
    (volumes) sel ACTIVE scds, display vols in storage group STD$MED (or
    whichever), verify new vol is there.

12. ISMF panel 2 (volumes), display volume statuses in SMS, confirm everything
    is OK.  In particular, make sure SYSA physical status (col. 22) is ENABLED
    (or DISNEW if appropriate), and Storage Group Name (col. 23) is correct.

13. Add volume to disk accounting (modify vol list in
    WYL.AY.MRC.EXEC#RASRASJC, or notify Harley Goes).

14. Add volume to disk backups:  create GDG base for backup (use JCL in
    WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB#MVSSEG).  Find a time slot for the backup to run, and
    modify settings in WYL.GW.DSK.NEWFILE.  See Meighan or Parker for
    assistance.

15. If a spill volume (e.g. STR400) had been partly filled before the new
    volume was added, migrate datasets off of it once the new volume is added.
    SMS.LIB(MIGSTR4) is a job to migrate all datasets from STR400.  Normally
    STR400 is in status QUINEW so it can serve as a spill volume.

SYSB/SYSG volumes===================================================

In general the same rules and procedures apply to SYSB/SYSG as to SYSA/SYSD.
SMS.LIB(I#PHX1nn) is prototype JCL for adding a PHOENIX volume.  For SYSB
there are different CDS names; also, since WYLBUR does not run on SYSG, one
must go to an actual console (or use a TSO session) to vary on/offline on
SYSG.

SYSB does not run disk accounting, so the discussion of RASRASJC does not
apply.  SYSB backup procedures are the same as on SYSA.

REMOVING A VOLUME===================================================

To remove a volume from an SMS storage pool:

1.  Set the status of the volume to DISNEW:  ISMF panel 6, Storage Group;
    current SCDS, "alter volume", set status to DISNEW on SYSA and SYSD.

    Activate updated SCDS.  Confirm volume status:  Panel 2, Volume; display
    ACTIVE CDS, verify DISNEW status.

2.  Migrate all data off of the volume.  SMS.LIB(MIG#009) is an example JCL.
    Data will be migrated into SMS pools.  This job uses LOGINDYNAM and
    ALLMULTI keywords to ensure that multivolume datasets partly residing on
    the volume are moved.

3.  Run DISKLOOK or equivalent on the volume, make sure everything is gone.
    NOTE:  If a portion of a multivolume dataset is on the volume, it will NOT
    be migrated by the volume migrate job unless it used the ALLMULTI option
    as described above.  In such cases the migrate job will NOT issue any
    warning messages.   Note that SHOW DSN in WYLBUR does not handle
    multivolume datasets correctly.  You can get info on these by XCALL
    WYL.GA.MCL.WINGS.COMMANDS(FILESHOW)/LIKE=dsn REPORT=DSCB.  This will show
    all volumes.

    If there are portions of multivolume datasets on the volume, migrate these
    by dsname (not by volume).  SMS.LIB(MIGMVDS) is an example job.

4.  If everything is gone, remove the volume from disk accounting JCL (modify
    vol list in WYL.AY.MRC.EXEC#RASRASJC, or notify Harley Goes).  Remove from
    backup processing (see Jose or Meg).

5.  Unconvert the volume:  SMS.LIB(UNSMS).  This job will leave the volume in
    a "nonSMS" state if it runs without errors.  Note:  The presence of datasets
    with weird problems (e.g. missing NVR) will cause the job to fail.  See
    SMS.LIB(DELNVR) for JCL to delete these datasets.

6.  Delete catalog back-pointers from VVDS:  SMS.LIB(DELVVDS) job deletes them
    from most likely catalogs, then prints VVDS with IDCAMS to see what catalog
    references remain.  Do further

         DELETE SYS1.VVDS.VSTRnnn NOSCRATCH CATALOG(<name>)
    for each such catalog.

7.  Delete VVDS from the volume:  SMS.LIB(DELVVDS) or just DELETE SYS1.VVDS.VSTR

8.  Volume may now be re-initialized as needed.
