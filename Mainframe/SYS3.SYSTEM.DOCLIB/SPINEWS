1     DOCUMENTATION PROCEDURES FOR NEW SPIRES PRODUCTION SYSTEMS

                         by John Klemm

 This paper describes the processes to be followed when a new
 production version of SPIRES is installed, in regard to
 documentation concerns, such as the rebuilding of the EXPLAIN file,
 republishing of documents for PERFORM PUBLISH, etc.  Much as I would
 like to guarantee that he or she who follows these procedures can
 have no trouble, I just can't.  The unexpected occasionally happens.
 In general, if a problem occurs, you should stop the procedure and
 get me to help, assuming I'm available.

 In situations where problems are frequent enough that I could
 anticipate them, I wrote some suggestions.  In some places where
 the impact of what you're doing is extremely significant, such as
 replacing the production EXPLAIN file with the test one, I gave
 instructions for gracefully backing out.


1I. Write the SPIRES News

 SPIRES News must be written in a specific form:

 ....v....1....v....2....v....3....v....4....v....5....v....6....v...
 *mm/dd/yy  THIS IS THE UPPERCASE HEADLINE; MUST FIT ON ONE LINE

 This is the first article.  Like all News articles, it begins in
 column 1.  No line should be longer than 68 characters, including
 the headline.  No line other than a headline should begin with an
 asterisk (*) in column 1.  If an example or piece of syntax is
 shown, it is indented as many columns as desired, usually about 5,
 and surrounded by blank lines:

      -> ; this is an example

 The reason the blank lines are necessary, as well as the indentation
 of the examples is that in some situations, the News is realigned to
 a different line length.  (I believe it's only done for the Document
 Sales version of SPIRES News.)  If the appropriate blank lines were
 not present, the realignment would screw things up a bit.

 *mm/dd/yy  THIS IS THE START OF THE NEXT NEWS STORY

 For the date, "mm" should be "^n" where "^" is a blank if n is less
 than 10.  In other words, use "* 1/01/84" rather than "*01/01/84".
 Also, be sure each article ends with a blank line, as the last item
 demonstrates.

 Once the News is written, it must be reviewed by John Sack, and
 perhaps by others in the group whose work is being documented.
 Before submitting it to John, you should arrange the items in an
 appropriate order, usually starting with the news of the most
 general interest (I try to put them in the order "Searching and
 Updating", "Protocols", "File Definition", "Formats", and "Device
 Services" items.) or of the most importance, if it isn't too
 esoteric.

1II.  The SPIRES News Supplement

 Once the News has been approved, the News Supplement should be
 created.  Here, the best thing to do is to follow the example of
 the first issue, Supplement 83.06a, available online through PERFORM
 PUBLISH or as the data set WYL.GQ.DOC.PUBLISH.SUP8306A.  Because
 of all the character set control, etc., I'd recommend printing a
 copy and checking it over before going any further.

 When complete, it should be saved as WYL.GQ.DOC.PUBLISH.SUPyynnn ON
 INT001.  The "yy" is the year, and "nnn" is the release month for
 the new production system, e.g., "09".  An optional letter such as
 A may be appended, if the supplement is not the first one for the
 production system, or if it does not document all the major changes
 of a production system.  (In the latter case, the first issue is an
 example -- it came out for the 83.06 production system, but only
 contained a few items that hadn't been announced when the production
 system was first installed.)

 The best way to do this is to save the supplement as TRANSFER under
 GQ.JNK.  Then, on GQ.JNK, issue the command:

  EXEC FROM LIB#TRANSFER PARM='PUBLISH.SUPyynnn'

 which will save the contents of TRANSFER on GQ.DOC, setting the
 PROTECT status to group GQ write and PUBLIC read.

1III. Rebuilding the EXPLAIN File

 When all the documentation for the new system has been installed,
 the EXPLAIN file should be built.  There are several steps involved:

 1) On my account, RUN FROM WYL.GQ.DOC.LIB#PROCESS.  That job
 will process all the SPIDOC files so that the "freshest" information
 is available for the EXPLAIN file.

 2) Next, logon to account GG.SPI and RUN FROM EXPLAIN#JOB HOLD.
 That job builds the SPIRES file GG.SPI.TXPLAIN, which will be
 renamed to GG.SPI.EXPLAIN later.  Because of the system resources
 used, this job should be run at night or on weekends, preferably
 when not much else is going on.  It takes about an hour for all the
 jobs in the program to run if it's a quiet night on the system.

 As the jobs execute, you will receive periodic messages, telling
 you that the individual jobs (EXPLAIN, SYNTAX, EXAMPLE, SYSTEM1,
 and SYSTEM3) have completed execution.  With each message
 comes a series of condition codes, like this:

    EXPLAIN ENDED -- SPIERA1=8, SPIRES1=0, FASTERA1=8, FAST1=0,
     NODOC=0, ALTER=0

 These messages tell whether the job ran properly or not.  Responses
 of "0" indicate that the job step worked fine.  Responses of 8
 indicate trouble.  However, in the case above, the steps with 8s
 are steps that erase data sets if they were left over from the last
 time the EXPLAIN job ran.  Since they usually aren't there, a
 response of 8 for any ERA step is ok.

 3) While that job is running, publish new copies of all the manuals
 for the PERFORM PUBLISH command: RUN FROM WYL.GQ.DOC.SPIKE#PUBLISH.
 Actually, not all the manuals are published -- the ones
 not included are "Guide to Data Base Development" and "System
 Procs", which require special handling.  Unless they have been
 changed significantly for the new system, they are usually not
 republished.

 4) Another good way to pass the time while the EXPLAIN file is
 running is to be sure the old version of the EXPLAIN file (from the
 previous production system) is gone.  It's the file GG.SPI.OXPLAIN.
 It must be erased, not zapped.  To do so, get on account GG.SPI, and
 then:

   EXEC FROM EXPLAIN#ERASEOXP

 5) When the EXPLAIN jobs have finished running, you need to test the
 newly created file.  You need to be on account GQ.JNK, then EXEC
 FROM SPIDOC#EXPSUBSZ.  This exec file displays the number of records
 in each of the new subfiles (TEXPLAIN, TSYNTAX, TEXAMPLE, TSYSTEM
 MESSAGES), comparing them to the current production subfiles.  The
 new numbers should be reasonable, in comparison to the old ones.
 (Since we usually add more new keyterms than we remove, the numbers
 usually go up.)

 If you want to see how the file has changed, in terms of record
 keys, do the following:

  SELECT EXPLAIN
  FOR SUBFILE
  IN ACTIVE SHO KEYS ALL
  SAVE EXPLAIN TEMP
  SELECT TEXPLAIN
  FOR SUBFILE
  IN ACTIVE SHO KEYS ALL
  SAVE TEXPLAIN TEMP
  CLEAR ACTIVE
  XCALL WYL.GG.SCH.XPROCS#COMPARE / EXPLAIN / TEXPLAIN / DUMP

 This is a bit expensive, and should only be done at night or on
 weekends.

 You should also display some records from the TXPLAIN file,
 just to be sure everything is ok.  For instance, I usually display
 many of the terms listed in the News (e.g., "EXPLAIN IN-AREA
 STATEMENT for more information").  If you want, you can fool SPIRES
 into using the TXPLAIN subfile instead of EXPLAIN when you use
 the EXPLAIN command, though the procedure is not extremely easy:

      > call spires (b) lib orv.gg.tes.teslib
      -> show core # match 'GG.SPI.EXPLAIN'
         (press break to stop display after a few lines)
      -> patch core 0701829 'GG.SPI.T' verify 'GG.SPI.E'

 The number following "core" in the last command is not the real
 number you should use, but it is close.  Use the number on the
 left side of the screen on the first row of the SHOW CORE display,
 prefixed by a "0", to make it 7 characters long.  (It's a hex value,
 so it might have letters in it as well as numerals.)

 Once you've patched core, you've told SPIRES to look in the
 GG.SPI.TXPLAIN file rather than the GG.SPI.EXPLAIN file when
 handling the EXPLAIN, SHOW SYNTAX, and SHOW EXAMPLE commands.
 Test the new file with those commands as desired.

1IV. Installing the SPIRES News

 To install the News, you should be on account GQ.JNK.  Get the news
 into your active file, make sure the very first line is a blank
 line, and then:

   CALL SPIRES
   ..SPIRES.NEWS

 If everything is ok, you will get no weird messages and WYLBUR will
 ask you if it's ok to replace WYL.GA.PUB.SPIRES.NEWS, and it is
 just fine to do so.  This protocol installs the news on the A
 machine and adds the news to SPIRES.NEWS PUBLIC.

 Next you need to add the new News to the SPIRES NEWS ARCHIVE
 subfile.  Get the news into your active file again, this time
 without the blank line at the start, and then:

   COPY TO 0 FROM SPIDOC#NEWSBTCH
   CALL SPIBILD
   SET FORMAT **ORV.HA.GRC.BATCH
   BATCH SPIRES NEWS ARCHIVE

1V. Creating Other Documents for PERFORM PUBLISH

 There are some other documents that need to be created next:
 SPIRES.NEWS PUBLIC, SPIRES NEWS INDEX and SPIRES KEYTERM INDEX.

 1) SPIRES.NEWS PUBLIC:  EXEC FROM SPIDOC#NEWSPUBL on acct GQ.JNK.
 This EXEC file adjusts the data set SPIRES.NEWS PUBLIC for
 the PERFORM PUBLISH command.  When it's done, USE PUBLISH.SPINEWS
 ACCOUNT GQ.DOC, and SHOW VAL LINES/60 -- round the answer up
 to the next integer for the number of pages and write it down.
 (You'll need that number later.)

 2) SPIRES NEWS INDEX: RUN FROM SPIDOC#NEWSINDX on acct. GQ.JNK.
 This job will create that document and save it as PUBLISH.NEWSINDX
 on acct GQ.DOC.  Use that data set and COUNT '1'1 to get the number
 of pages in it.

 3) KEYTERM INDEX: On my account, EXIT from SPIRES, then EXEC FROM
 SPIDOC#INDXBILD.  It has to do some weird things, including a
 CALL SORT -- some unusual things might get displayed, but ignore
 them till you get the message to change the date.  The current
 date should be placed on line 0.07 (I think -- the program will
 tell you.).  You should center it with the line that's two lines
 above it -- 0.05, I think.  Also change the copyright date, which
 is a few lines down from that.  Then, EXEC to finish up.  It will
 save the document as PUBLISH.KEYTERM on account GQ.DOC.  The Exec
 file will also report the number of pages in the document, and it
 (the document) will be left in your active file.

1VI.  PERFORM PUBLISH changes.

 Under account GQ.JNK:

   SELECT PUBLISH VARS
   SET FORMAT BATCH
   FOR SUBFILE
   IN ACTIVE CLR CLN DISPLAY ALL

 You'll get a list that looks something like this:

 ....v....1....v....2....v....3....v....4....v....5....
 07/01/83 PRIMER   141 Guide to Data Base Development
 01/08/84 SRCHUPDT 335 Searching and Updating
 01/08/84 SRCHPRIM 53  Guide to Searching
 01/08/84 GLOBFOR  112 Global FOR
 01/08/84 FILEDEF  519 File Definition
 01/08/84 DEFINER  93  File Definer
 04/25/83 SYSPROCS 233 System Procs
 01/08/84 FORMATS  374 Formats
 01/08/84 FORMPRIM 77  Guide to Output Formats
 01/08/84 PROTOCOL 206 Protocols
 01/08/84 DEVSERV  166 Device Services
 01/08/84 TECHNOTE 141 Technical Notes
 01/08/84 SUP8401  38  SPIRES News Supplement 84.01
 10/26/83 SUP8309  42  SPIRES News Supplement 83.09
 07/04/83 SUP8306A 33  SPIRES News Supplement 83.06A
 01/08/84 SPINEWS  168 SPIRES.NEWS PUBLIC
 01/08/84 NEWSINDX 59  SPIRES News Index
 01/08/84 KEYTERM  55  SPIRES Keyterm Index
 01/08/84 SPIDOC   169 SPIDOC
 03/22/83 SPISPECS 121 SPIRES Specs

 This list is the list of manuals available through PERFORM PUBLISH.
 The first column (cols 1/8) represent the publication date of each
 version on the tape.  The second represents the name of the dataset
 on INT001 for account GQ.DOC under which it is stored, preceded by
 PUBLISH (e.g., the first one is stored as WYL.GQ.DOC.PUBLISH.PRIMER.)
 The name given here may not exceed 8 characters.

 The third column (cols 19-21) represents the number of pages for the
 document.  The fourth column represents the name of the document as
 it is to appear in the PERFORM PUBLISH menu.

 These documents are listed in the order in which they appear on the
 PERFORM PUBLISH menu.

 Your task is to change the appropriate numbers, add new documents
 if necessary in the menu where desired, etc.

 To find out the number of pages in the documents published by the
 SPIDOC#BATPUBL job (see section III above), look at the output from
 that job, or, if that is unavailable:

   EXEC FROM SPIDOC#COUNTPAG ACCOUNT GQ.JNK

 WARNING:  This EXEC file clears your active file.  Save the PERFORM
 PUB values that are in your active file somewhere else before
 running this EXEC.  Also, this EXEC file takes a while -- if you're
 the impatient kind, you might want to have a BATWYL job issue the
 EXEC file, and then fetch the results.

 Once you have made the changes, make sure you still have the
 PUBLISH VARS subfile selected in SPIRES and the changed values in
 your active file.  Then:

   FOR SUBFILE
   REMOVE ALL
   CALL SPIBILD
   SET FORMAT BATCH
   SET INFO MESSAGES 0
   BATCH PUBLISH VARS
   CALL SPIRES
   ..ASSIGN.PUB.VARS

 That job replaces the values in a stored static group with the new
 variable values.  It's ok to replace them, when you're asked about
 it by the protocol.

 Once you're done, it's a good idea to issue the PERFORM PUBLISH
 command just to verify that your new values appear properly in the
 menu.  Publishing one or two manuals (short ones are fine) and
 fetching the output to be sure the right ones got printed is a
 useful exercise too.

1VII.  Replacing the production EXPLAIN file with the test one

 This is the most important part to get right.  You're zapping and
 copying production files, so don't mess up!

 First, logon to the GG.SPI account, and then:

   RUN FROM EXPLAIN#RENAME HOLD

 If there is any problem at all with the RENAME job, contact me.

 Once the RENAME job is done, issue a few EXPLAIN commands
 (e.g., EXPLAIN FIND COMMAND, EXPLAIN S2 (to get a message from
 SYSTEM MESSAGES), SHOW EXAMPLE FIND COMMAND, etc.) to be sure that
 all is well.

1VIII.  Set the SPIRES message

 On account GQ.JNK, set the SPIRES message as follows:

   MASTER
   SPIMSG -mm/dd Message you want to appear when users CALL SPIRES.

 The message should not exceed 79 characters in length, and usually
 includes 'SHOW SPIRES NEWS' or some legitimate abbreviation to lead
 users to the News.

1IX. Distributing the SPIRES News Supplement

 For now, skip this step.  We're not sending it out right now.

 From any GQ account:

   SELECT SUB
   FIND SUPPLEMENT YES
   SEQUENCE
   SET FORMAT SUP
   - Answer the question with the name of the dataset holding the
   - Supplement: "WYL.GQ.DOC.PUBLISH.SUPyynnn".
   - If it doesn't exist, you'll be prompted for it again.
   SET REPORT
   IN ACT CLR TYPE
   RUN HOLD

 That job will mail copies out to all subscribers of the Supplement.

1X. B Machine Considerations

 This is usually done a week or two after the new SPIRES is
 moved into production on the A machine.

 You need to get the SPIRES News, the "SPIMSG" you set and the
 EXPLAIN file over to the B machine.  It's a good idea to
 write down the SPIRES message somewhere before you start working
 on the B machine.

 1) On the A Machine:

 On account GQ.JNK:

   SELECT SPIRES MAIL
   TRANSFER NEWS..
   PUNCH UNN DEST=RLG

 (The PUNCH stuff is explained briefly below.)

 Again, get on account GG.SPI, but on the A machine still.  Then:

   RUN FROM EXPLAIN#ORVCOPYA HOLD

 This job dumps a copy of the new EXPLAIN file on a tape.  When
 the job has run, issue the FETCH command to fetch the output, and
 then check in the first few lines for the 6-character tape number
 of the scratch tape used by the job.  Then:

   USE EXPLAIN#ORVCOPYB

 and plug the tape number into the appropriate spots in that JCL
 (currently lines 1.5, 1.6 and 4.5, I think).  Then:

   PUNCH UNN DEST=RLG

 That gets the JCL over to the B machine, submitting it as a data
 set to be put on punched cards.  Since punching cards is done
 about once a week, there's little need to worry that the job will
 be punched and disappear.

 Anyway, jot down the job name for the PUNCH job.  (The number
 might not work -- I'm not sure.)

 2) On the B Machine:   (class 6, then class 4)

 Logon to the B machine on account GG.SPI.  Then issue the command

   FETCH jobname
   RUN HOLD
   PURGE jobname ; to get rid of the PUNCH job

 That will start a job that will copies the file off the tape,
 replacing the old EXPLAIN file with the new one.  This too takes
 a while.  Preferably it should be done in the evening, or on the
 weekend.

 On the B machine, logon to GQ.JNK (it may or may not have the
 same keyword as on the A machine), retrieve the news you punched
 to the B machine, and then:

   CALL SPIRES
   SELECT SPIRES MAIL
   ADDUPDATE
   SHOW SPIRES NEWS ; to verify that it's there.

 Be sure to purge the PUNCH job when you are done.

 Change the message as described earlier:

   MASTER
   SPIMSG -mm/yy Message you want, same as displayed on A machine.


 Congratulations! That's all there is to it.
