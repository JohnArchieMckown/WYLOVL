        Creating OMVS segment in RACF; 22 LINES

Mike and Susan,

Here is some JCL to create the OMVS segment in RACF:

//ALTUSER JOB ,CLASS=E
/*JOBPARM JCL=NO,LOG=NO
//RACF EXEC RACF
ALTUSER AS$SLS OMVS(UID(19191219) HOME('/var/tmp') PROGRAM('/bin/sh'))

You must run this job as RACF special.  GB.SEC can do this.

The only tricky part is setting the UID.  It should be unique and
must not exceed the magic number of 2147483647.  Given this constraint
JC and I agreed that taking the last four characters of the account
and assigning the alphabetic position to the alphas and prefixing
a '9" to the numerics would give a unique value most of the time.
Thus, AS$SLS ==> SSLS  ==> 19 19 12 19  ==> 19191219
and   AM$A95 ==> MA95  ==> 01 13 99 95  ==> 01139995
