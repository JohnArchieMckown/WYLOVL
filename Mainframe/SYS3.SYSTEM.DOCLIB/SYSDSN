              Where to Find Stanford Local System Code


MVS exits, SVCs, usermods, and similarly integral parts
will be stored as appropriate in:

      SYS3.USERMODS.SOURCE
      SYS3.USERMODS.OBJECT
      SYS3.USERMODS.LINKLIB
      SYS3.USERMODS.JCL

Each production member will be named using the standard name
of the object being named.  The same name will be used in all
four libraries if there are objects in all four.  JCL to
assemble and link the objects will normally be stored in the
JCL library.  These objects will not normally have JCL other
than that to build them.  Backup members of these libraries
will be named by appending/changing characters of the
programmer's choice on the right.  Text members will be stored
using WYLBUR with titles attached identifying the version/
release/date/etc as appropriate.

For local utility programs, source and the JCL to compile and
link the load modules and, if appropriate, sample run JCL
will be stored as appropriate in:

      SYS3.SYSTEM.SOURCE
      SYS3.SYSTEM.JCL

Library member names will follow the convention for system
components as much as possible.  These members should also
be stored using WYLBUR with titles attached for documentation.
