To apply maintenance to SyncSort 3.6, you must copy member SS36PROF     00030000
from the ISPPROF "GG$JOV.ISPPROF(SS36PROF)" dataset of the person who   00040000
last did SyncSort maintenance to your ISPPROF dataset.  It would be a   00050000
good idea to tell the previous person that his/her SS36PROF is no       00060000
longer current.                                                         00070000
                                                                        00080000
SyncSort maintenance is performed using the SYNCINIT procedure.  To     00090000
start it up, exec 'GG$JOV.CLIST(SYNCDEF)'.                              00100000
                                                                        00110000
SyncSort install datasets follow our convention:                        00120000
SYS2.SYNCSORT.R36.xxx, with LPALIB and LINKLIB copied to                00130000
SYS1.SYNCSORT.R36.LINKLIB/LPALIB for user's use.                        00140000
