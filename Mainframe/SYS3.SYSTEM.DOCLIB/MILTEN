MILTEN Notes:

MILTEN uses the following files:

  WYL.GS.MIL.MILTEN.SYSx.LINKLIB - This is the PDS which contains
                                   the MILTEN load module

  WYL.GS.MIL.SYSx.PORTS          - This text file contains the
                                   definitions for all front ends,
                                   consoles, and TCP/IP ports used
                                   by MILTEN.

  WYL.GS.MIL.TABLE               - This text file contains the
                                   translation table definitions
                                   used by RLG and others.


In addition, entries are needed in SYS1.PARMLIB to establish
MILTEN's performance group, add APF entries for MILTEN's
load module library and a PPT entry for MILTEN. These entries
are as follows:

In member PROG0x, MILTEN requires the following APF entry
for its load module library:

   APF ADD DSN(WYL.GS.MIL.MILTEN.SYSx.LINKLIB)     VOLUME(SYSx01)

In member SCHED0x, MILTEN requires the following PPT entry:

   PPT PGMNAME(MILTEN) KEY(7) NOSWAP NOPASS

In member IEAICS0x, MILTEN has the following entry under the
STC SUBSYS group of statements:

   TRXNAME=MILTEN,PGN=13

In member IEAIPS0x, the following statements pertain to MILTEN's
performance group:

   DMN=13,CNSTR=(999,999)

   PGN=13,(DMN=13,DP=F6)
