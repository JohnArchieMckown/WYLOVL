ORVYL File System Restore:

The ability to restore Orvyl files can be separated into two
distinct areas. First, is the complete restoration of an entire
Orvyl file system.  Second, is the ability to restore individual
Orvyl files back to an existing healthy Orvyl file system.

In both of these restore operations, we have the ability to either
utilize a full Orvyl dump set, or to merge the full dump set with an
incremental stream of blocks.

The full file system restore jobs, as well as the individual
selective file restore jobs, use as their input the Orvyl dump tapes
created by the FILEDUMP Orvyl dump utility job.  In addition, the
individual selective file restores require as input, a flat-file
dump of the Orvyl index record structure. The dumped IXR'S reflect
which block belongs to the particular file and in what order.


Full File System Restore:

A full file system restore is the last fallback position available
after all other recovery techniques have failed.  The ORVFMT program
is used to format new Orvyl volumes, and is also the program used
for the restore operation.  Several additional EXEC parameter fields
cause the ORVFMT program to read and merge any potential incremental
data from the base dump and write the blocks to the new data set as
it is being formatted.

The full file system restore uses the dump tapes produced by the
FILEDUMP utility and optionally uses the incremental data which is
also created by the FILEDUMP utility program.  Below is a sample
template of a restore job:

// job ,class=b,time=20
/*setup t=?,input=?
//rest exec pgm=orvfmt,parm='vols=?,...,restore,incdata'
//steplib dd dsn=wyl.gg.orv.linklib,disp=shr
//file00  dd dsn=..... [describes Orvyl file system being]
//file01  dd dsn=..... [restored/rebuild                 ]
    .
    .
    .
//dumptape dd dsn=.... [A full Orvyl file dump tape set]
//incdata  dd dsn=.... [Optional incremental data, if requested]

In addition to other previously documented formatting parameters,
the addition of the RESTORE keyword places the ORVFMT utility in
the file system restore mode.  Blocks are read sequentially from the
DUMPTAPE data definition statement and written to the file system as
the track images are being formatted.

Orvyl Selective File Restores:

The same source data, which is the full dump and potential
incremental data used by the ORVFMT program is also used by
the SRESTORE program to perform a "selective" file restore.  In
addition to the dump of the Orvyl blocks, the Orvyl index records
are processed to assemble and locate the blocks which are required
to restore the files.

The process of selectively restoring Orvyl files proceed as
follows:

1.)  The SRESTORE program will logon as a "virtual" terminal under
the account in which the SRESTORE program is running.

2.)  The SYSIN restore command stream is read, parsed, and a table
is built reflecting which files need to be recovered from the base
dump.

3.)  The dump of the index records is processed and internal tables
are built to reflect which absolute Orvyl blocks belong to which
individual Orvyl files.

4.)  The identified block numbers are sorted into ascending order by
absolute Orvyl block number(s) so that only one pass through the
base dump is required to perform the restore.

5.)  All requested restore files are ATTACHED in prepartion to being
restores.

6.)  The dump tape, along with the optional incremental data, is
read sequentailly.  When one of the required blocks is encountered,
it is written to the proper ATTACHED file in its proper relative
block location within the user file.

7.)  Done!

A sample job stream to selectively restore a damaged PRISM log would
be:

The Orvyl selective file restore program uses the mere presence of
the DUMPING data definition statement to determine if this restore
will be an incremental restore.
