Adding an Orvyl file system volume to an existing Orvyl file system.
(this is SYS3.SYSTEM.DOCLIB#ORVADDVL)

These notes are current as of May 27, 1999 and were written during
the process of adding an additional volume to the FIS file system.
In this scenario we were asked to add additional blocks to the FIS
file system to support Y2K testing.  In preparing to add a volume
check the following table to determine the file system
characteristics.  When running the volume initializations, data set
allocations, and the Orvyl formatting account GW.DSK has the
appropriate level of access authority.

1. When adding a volume to a SYSA Orvyl file system on the EMC 5430
we are currently using 3390-2 type geometry with BCV mirroring for
the majority of our file systems.
* Select an available NEWxxx 3390-2 volume.
* Select an available 3390-2 BCV volume address, preferably with the
same control unit address.  (Currently we have no good way to
dynamically determine whether a volume is a BCV candidate or not.
Check with Parker for the time being.  This will change in the long
run.)
* Insure that the selected device addresses are offline to all
LPAR's.

In this example we have selected a standard 3390-2 NEW volume at
device address 0E81 and paired it with the BCV volume at address
0EC9.

2. Check to insure that the selected BCV volume has not been
established to any other volume within the complex.  The command
used to determine the status of a BCV volume is the QUERY command
and may be run safely from any LPAR against any BCV volume.  It is a
non-disruptive command.  The following JCL segment from
WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB(BCVQUE) may be used as a model to determine the
current status of the selected BCV device.

//query job gw.dsk,class=e,time=(,5)
//tmfndr exec  pgm=emctf,region=4m
//steplib  dd  dsn=wyl.gs.emc.tmfndr32.linklib,disp=shr
//sysout   dd  sysout=a
//sysin    dd  *
QUERY 001,0EC9,1

3. Check the Orvyl parameter library for the file system in which
you are going to add the volume.  In this example we are adding a
volume to the Orvyl FIS file system whose control stream member is:
WYL.GG.ORV.ALPHA.STREAM(FIS).  By checking the Segment definitions
we see that the next segment would be Segment 20.

Segment 19
    Start 11735179                 ;317167 * 37
    Sequence 18
      File WYL.GS.ORV.FIS.EMC.FILE36   ;Enabled 02/13/99 pjg
      File WYL.GS.ORV.FIS.EMC.FILE37   ;Enabled 02/13/99 pjg
Endseg;

We can now determine from the system catalog that the next volume to
be added would be XFIS20 and that the next two data sets would be
FILE38 and FILE39.

4. Initialize the new volume on address 0E81 to XFIS20 with the
standard 3390-2 VTOC size of three tracks with no index.  Verify
that the device address is offline to all other LPARs in the
complex.  The following JCL example may be used as the model for the
initialization.

//INIT JOB GW.DSK,CLASS=B,TIME=(,15)
//DSF    EXEC  PGM=ICKDSF,PARM='NOREPLYU'
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=A
//SYSIN    DD  *
  INIT UNIT(0E81) NOINDEX VTOC(0,1,3) -
       VERIFY(NEWE81) VOLID(XFIS20)

After the volume initialization has completed successfully bring the
volume online on SYSA and verify the volume table of content size.

5. Allocate and format two new Orvyl file system data sets for the
FIS file system. The parameters given the Orvyl format program are
indicating that we will be formatting two file system data sets,
that the data sets will have a hardware key, and that the Orvyl
header size will be 20 bytes.  By default the Orvyl format program
will create a 2K Orvyl file system data set.  The following JCL
example may be used as a model:

// job gw.dsk,class=b,time=(,15)
//fmt    exec  pgm=orvfmt,parm='vols=2,key,hdr=20'
//steplib  dd  dsn=wyl.gg.orv.linklib,disp=shr
//file00   dd  dsn=wyl.gs.orv.fis.emc.file38,unit=disk,
//             disp=(,catlg),
//             space=(trk,16693,,contig),vol=ser=xfis20
//file01   dd  dsn=wyl.gs.orv.fis.emc.file39,unit=disk,
//             disp=(,catlg),
//             space=(trk,16693,,contig),vol=ser=xfis20

When the formatting job has completed map the volume to insure that
all available space on the volume has been accounted for.

6. Now it's time to return to the control file describing the FIS
file system and update three portions to indicate the availability
of the new volume and its associated business continuance volume.

* Add the information describing the new segment and data sets at
the end of FIS control stream input.  The segment number should be
one greater than the last segment in the control stream as the
sequence number specification.  The Start parameter informs the file
dump process the Orvyl absolute block number of the first block it
will read in this segment.  Insure that the Start parameter number
is absolutely correct.  This information is imperative for the
incremental restore process.

Segment 20
  Start 12369513                    ;317167 * 39
  Sequence 19
    File WYL.GS.ORV.FIS.EMC.FILE38  ;Enabled 05/27/99 *pjg*
    File WYL.GS.ORV.FIS.EMC.FILE39
Endseg;

* Update the modification log
* Update the BCV definition section for the new volume.  In this
example we have added the definition for the pairing of XFIS20 with
its third BCV volume mirror at address 0EC9.

BCVdef;            ;Define BCV pairings
   Volume=XFISXX    Device=0ECE
   Volume=XFIS01    Device=0EAB
   Volume=XFIS02    Device=0EAC
   Volume=XFIS03    Device=0EAD
   Volume=XFIS04    Device=0EAE
   Volume=XFIS05    Device=0DAC
   Volume=XFIS06    Device=0DAD
   Volume=XFIS07    Device=0DAE
   Volume=XFIS08    Device=0DAF
   Volume=XFIS09    Device=0DB0
   Volume=XFIS10    Device=0EAF
   Volume=XFIS11    Device=0EB0
   Volume=XFIS12    Device=0EB1
   Volume=XFIS13    Device=0DB1
   Volume=XFIS14    Device=0DB2
   Volume=XFIS15    Device=0DB3
   Volume=XFIS16    Device=0DB4
   Volume=XFIS17    Device=0DB5
   Volume=XFIS18    Device=0DB6
   Volume=XFIS19    Device=0EB2
   Volume=XFIS20    Device=0EC9
EndDef;

7. Build the generation data group necessary for the new file system
segment.  We currently maintain three months of full backups for
each of our production file systems.  A full dump is taken once per
week.  This requires the retention of 12 generations.  Although it
is not required; we do try and keep all of the FILSEG, IXRDUMP, and
DIRDUMP generation data groups synchronized.  The current generation
numbers may be found either by using the IDCAMS service utility or
you can check the output from the last full file system dump under
the VMNTPRT report.    The following JCL example may be used as a
template:

// job gw.dsk,class=e,time=(,15)
//gdg    exec  pgm=idcams
//sysprint dd  sysout=a
//sysin    dd  *
 /* Define the generation data group for .FILSEG20 */
 DEFINE GDG(NAME(WYL.GS.ORV.FIS.FILSEG20) -
        LIMIT(12) NOEMPTY SCRATCH)
 /* Define the dummy placeholder to maintain synchronization */
 DEFINE NVSAM(NAME(WYL.GS.ORV.FIS.FILSEG20.G0646V00) -
        VOL(DUMMY) FSEQN(1) DEVT(3490))

8. Perform the initial Establish between the newly created standard
Orvyl file system volume and its paired business continuance volume.
 This process requests that the EMC 5430 control unit create a
mirrored copy of the standard volume on to the M3 volume.

CAUTION: The following JCL segment from WYL.GW.DSK.DISKLIB(BCVEST)
may be used, as a template, to perform the initial establish of the
two volumes.  Be very sure to double check all of the parameters in
that this process WILL overwrite existing data with no warning!

//ofisest job gw.dsk,'FIS Establish',class=c,time=2
//*
//*  EMC TimeFinder 3.2
//*      Establish Orvyl FIS BCV volumes on EMC 5430
//*
//$PAUSE EXEC  PGM=oscmd,PARM='VARY 0EC9,OFFLINE'
//$PAUSE EXEC  PGM=oscmd,PARM='$WAIT 5'
//tmfndr exec  pgm=emctf,region=4m
//steplib  dd  dsn=wyl.gs.emc.tmfndr32.linklib,disp=shr
//sysout   dd  sysout=a
//sysin    dd  *
  GLOBAL MAXRC=0                   Abort on the littlest thing!
  QUERY 002,0EC9,1                 Query initial status
  ESTABLISH 015,0EC9,0E81,WAIT     Full establish for XFIS20
  QUERY 020,0EC9,1

9. Check the TLMS auto-scratch/toss status record to insure that the
newly created generation data groups are under the appropriate
auto-scratch/toss control.  A sequential flat file description of
the current auto-scratch file may be found in:
SYS2.TLM.AST.DSNSMSTR.  By inspecting the entries corresponding to
the FIS file system below we see that the newly created FILSEG20
generation data group is covered by the first entry.  If you
determine that the necessary auto-scratch/toss entries need to be
added or updated you will need to either go through the tape
librarian.  (If it was me doing this I'd go talk to the TLMS
programmer)
