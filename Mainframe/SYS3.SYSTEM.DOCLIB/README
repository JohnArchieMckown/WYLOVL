                       What is this library?

The library SYS3.SYSTEM.DOCLIB is intended to contain permanent
miscellaneous internal documentation of the Stanford Forsythe
system.  It contains formally written documentation as well as bits
and pieces of folklore learned over time -- where to find things,
how to build things, how things work.  Feel free to add
documentation as appropriate!  Please...
