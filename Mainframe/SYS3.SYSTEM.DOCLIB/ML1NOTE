notes on migration volume maintenance                     rev. 1998/06/15

To check on SDSP status, do LISTC LEVEL('HSM.SMALLDS') ALLOCATION (to get all
volumes) or LISTC LEVEL('HSM.SMALLDS.VHSM1xx') ALLOCATION (for a single volume
HSM1xx).  This can be done in TSO, batch TSO, or IDCAMS.  The output is a bit
verbose; you want to compare HI-A-RBA with HI-U-RBA for the DATA portion (the
SDSP is a VSAM cluster).  If it's more than 70% full, reorganize (condense)
the SDSP.  You can XC WYL.GA.MCL.SMS.LIB#SDSPFILT to clean up this output to a
more readable form.

To reorganize an SDSP dataset, or do other maintenance (e.g. move to new
device) on an ML1 volume, do the following:

1.  In TSO, do HSEND DELVOL volser MIGRATION

This makes the volume unavailable to HSM.  Attempts to retrieve datasets that
have been migrated to it will fail with a "volume unavailable" message.  In
most cases this is preferable to stopping HSM, which would make all migrated
datasets unavailable.  Also, if HSM is stopped, an attempt to reference a
migrated dataset will cause a WTO "HSM NOT RUNNING, START HSM" and a WTOR
"reply retry or cancel" for the OPEN that triggered the recall.

2.  Do the required volume work.  To condense an SDSP, see SMS.LIB(REORGSSP);
    to rebuild with new allocation, see REBLDSSP.  Use caution in attempting
    new allocations -- if the volume is full, you might not be able to
    allocate the new cluster, and could end up in an awkward spot, with the
    SDSP data exported and unable to be re-imported.

3.  HSEND ADDVOL volser UNIT(3390) MIGRATION(ML1 SDSP) to put the volume back
    in service.

To add an ML1 volume:

This is generally similar to adding a primary SMS volume (STR series).
However, you define it to HSM rather than to SMS.  Adding primary volumes is
described in WYL.GA.MCL.SMS.LIB(ADDVOL).

1.  Obtain a unit address for the new disk and verify its status in the usual
    way.

2.  Use JCL in SMS.LIB(I#HSM1NN), modify unit address, new voler, old volser.
    Though designed for mod 3 disk, this also works with mod 2.  Mod 1 would
    require modifying VTOC address and size, and SDSP size.

3.  Run (don't forget to vary offline on SYSD first).  Vary online on SYSD
    when done.

4.  Do the HSEND ADDVOL as described above under SDSP reorganization.

5.  Update SYS1.PARMLIB(ARCCMD0A) to include ADDVOL statement for the new
    volume.  Make the same change to SYS1.PARMLIB(ARCCMD0D) on SYSD.  Note:
    these two members are not identical, though their volume lists currently
    are.

6.  If migration has been stopped because of lack of ML1 space, do
    HSEND RELEASE MIGRATION to restart it.

Note:  Your account must have appropriate HSM privileges to issue ADDVOL and
DELVOL commands.  ISPF panel 6 (COMMAND) is a convenient way to issue the TSO
commands.
