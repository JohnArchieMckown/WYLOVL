Follow these steps for a simple shutdown of SYSH.  If you plan
on IPL'ing SYSH into a future date, use procedure in
SYS3.SYSTEM.DOCLIB#HALIPL.  This procedure has more detail
for system shutdown and IPL.


  Steps:                                       Action:

1.Drain the initiators 15 minutes prior
  to shutdown to prevent jobs going into
  execution and allowing jobs currently
  executing to finish.                       -----> $PI

2.To prevent further user logon to the
  system, 15 minutes prior to shutdown.      -----> @STOP ALL

3.Set/Broadcast message to users that
  the system is going down, 15 minutes
  prior to shutdown.                        -----> @SET MSG 'xxxxx'
                                            -----> @BRO ALL

4.Check to see if any TSO users are
  logged on, 15 minutes prior to
  shutdown.                                 -----> D TS,L

5.If there are TSO sessions, notify
  them to logoff prior to shutdown.         -----> SEND *put message
                                                   here*

6.Terminate remaining users who have
  not logged off.                           -----> @KILL ALL

7.Stop ORVYL so there is no dump.           -----> P ORVYL

8.To check if any programs are executing    -----> D A,L
