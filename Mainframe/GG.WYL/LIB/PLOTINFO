REPLY TO 04/29/81 13:57 FROM GG.LNG "Eagle": 

Eagle, let me make sure I understand things.  You know us  "dumb"
directors  are  kind  of  thick sometimes.  Now the 4025 does run
TOPDRAWER in 4013 mode, for which the driver  exists.   The  4025
does  NOT  run  TOPDRAWER  in "4025" mode, that is non-4013 mode.
Right?  Okay, assuming that's right, then  the  4662  runs  stuff
that  is directed to the 4025 in "4013" mode.  Right?  Assuming I
still am on track, then the 4662 does NOT  run  things  that  the
4025  runs in 4013 mode.  Right?  Well, if all the decision boxes
are right.  Here I am at the "process" box on my flow chart.

The process box now says:  Loan Roger a 4025 for some  period  of
time.   He  will  write a 4025 native mode driver for TOP DRAWER,
(which as I understand it means it's really in UGS).  That native
mode driver will provide what's necessary to run on the  4662  if
at some stage you give the command PERI ON.

Aha!  If that's the case, then I say good deal, we'll get  him  a
4025.   It's really worth it.  (I'll try to convince IRIS to loan
him theirs).  How about that!

Now if I am wrong, we'll just go back to GO - without  collecting
$200.
