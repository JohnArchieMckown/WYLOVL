There are two jobs in SUBMIT under gs.wyl.  The first, SAFEKEY,
will copy the keyword file to a backup data set.  It refers to
a keyword file which no longer exists at that location; it is not
scheduled.

The second job, WYLDAILY, runs an exec from WYL.GS.WYL.LIB#DAILY at
2am each morning to do the following:

         o  make new mail distribution lists
         o  reload record groups with the new dist lists
         o  update the wylbur volume list
         o  reload the testwyl dist and volume lists
         o  reload the servwyl dist and volume lists
