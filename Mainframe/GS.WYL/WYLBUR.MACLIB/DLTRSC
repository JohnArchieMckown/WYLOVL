.* this macro is used to remove a resource from the resource                    
.* group.  it is normally used during initialization to take a                  
.* resource off of the active chain.  this is done during init                  
.* when a resource block has been generated for a resource that                 
.* has not been included (or cannot be made to function).                       
.* a typical example might include the genning of several internal              
.* reader paths but only including a single dd card.  the open                  
.* failure will cause the resource block to be deleted.
