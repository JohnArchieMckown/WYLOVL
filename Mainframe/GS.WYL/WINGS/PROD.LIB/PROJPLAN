WINGS 2 project plan                             MCL and MPD   1994/11/09

This project plan estimates what will be required to implement WINGS 2 support
in WYLBUR (and WINGS) so that SMS can be turned on in MVS. It does not address
the goal of transferring all MVS file support from WYLBUR to WINGS (allowing
for the elimination of OLDIBM code from WYLBUR).

Note: The estimates are elapsed times to complete the tasks. They are
purposely not estimates of by what time the project will be finished. This is
because system interruptions or problems which require attention will occur
which may (temporarily) divert effort.

The commands (or options) to be changed are discussed below.  Time estimates
for the WYLBUR side are on the left, status and/or time estimates for the
WINGS side are on the right.

Except where noted, these can be completed in any order and none has any
particular dependence on others.

     SAVE  - add SMS modifiers to this command for storage class, management
             class and data class. Remove RECFM keyword checking.

Estimated time to decide on the keywords         Completed (alpha)
and values, add them to NFILE, WGS and           Refine/debug:  1-3 days
OPT modules in WYLBUR:  <= 1 day.

     ALLOCATE - change command completely over to use Wings. Add additional
             SMS class modifiers to command.

Estimated time to transfer allocate code         Completed (beta)
to NFILE, make changes to WGS module and         Refine/debug:  1-2 days
any scan tables (including time spent
understanding how ALLOCATE works now):
3-5 days

     SCRATCH  - change command completely over to use Wings. Add new command
              option ERASE=YES/NO to the WYLBUR command and transfer the
              option to Wings.

Estimated time: < 1 day, since the               Completed (beta)
scratch command is almost completely
implemented and working (just have to
add the ERASE option).

Note:  ERASE option is a security enhancement, and is not on SMS critical
path.  It was included in WINGS implementation for completeness.


     RENAME - change command completely over to use Wings.

Estimated time to make changes to NFILE,         Not yet implemented.
OPT, WGS modules: 3-5 days. Could be             estimate 3 days, plus 1-2
longer because this command does some            for debugging after WYLBUR
special things since it has to hold and          interface complete.
manipulate 2 FFINFO structures in WYLBUR
and Charley and Niz used special mods
for this since most commands only
manipulated one. I have to study this to
see if it has much of an effect.

Note:  This command, used to rename a dataset, is actually called OSRENAME in
WYLBUR, because the verb RENAME was preempted by ORVYL.  Since few users
actually manipulate ORVYL files, we would like to reassign the RENAME verb to
WYLBUR and pick some other for ORVYL.  However, this change is not related to
the WINGS conversion.

      SHOW DIR - change command completely over to use Wings.

Estimated time to make changes to NFILE,         Completed, well tested.
DIR, OPT and WGS:  depends on which of           If MPD needs changes, 1-2 days
the SHOW style commands (SHOW DIR, SHOW          depending on amount of change
CAT or SHOW DSNAMES) I implement first.          required.
The first one will take the longest
(estimate: 5-10 days). Subsequent ones
will be easier since there is a model to
follow (say about 5 days each).

      SHOW DSNAMES, SHOW CAT  - change command completely over to use Wings.

This change will be nontransparent, because
the philosophy has changed.  WINGS FILESHOW is only catalog driven, and the
intention is that SHOW DSN and SHOW CAT get somewhat merged.  There may be some
philosophical issues here that will need discussion by the group.

See comments above under SHOW DIR.  Some         Completed (beta).  Some changes
new options will be needed in WYLBUR;            may be necessary as WYLBUR
some old ones will become obsolete but           interface is refined.
can be "faked".


      CATALOG/UNCATALOG/RECATALOG -

this code can stay in WYLBUR for now, but we might want to make it part of the
WINGS 2 code, since Wings will probably have support for the new error codes
SMS will return and WYLBUR won't, thus making error messages from WYLBUR messy
on these operations (lots of CATERRs).

This is NOT on the SMS critical path, since you can't do any of these things to
an SMS-managed data set.

If these commands are moved to Wings,            Not implemented, but easy to
then the estimated time to make the              do, as all the code is already
WYLBUR mods is about 1 day each.                 there to support USE, SAVE,
                                                 and SCRATCH.
