*05/04/95  (rev.5/19/95) Dataset commands changed to use WINGS

These WYLBUR commands have been re-implemented to use the WINGS MVS
file system interface:

     ALLOCATE
     OSRENAME
     SCRATCH
     SHOW CATALOG
     SHOW DIRECTORY
     SHOW DSNAMES

In addition, the DSNINFO and DSNVERIFY Extended Exec functions now
use WINGS.

The changed commands will continue to work as before, although there
have been minor changes to the messages issued by these commands.

The behavior of SHOW DSNAMES has been changed.  When specified
without a volume, a list of all your datasets will be produced (by
searching the system catalog), rather than a list of just the
datasets on your default volume.  You can still obtain a list of your
datasets on a particular volume by using SHOW DSNAMES ON <volume>.
There is a change in the message output of SHOW DSNAMES without a
volume:  Previously, the first line would indicate the volume being
searched; now, this line does not appear (because no volume is being
searched).

The DSNINFO function now returns additional information in fields that
previously were "reserved":

   columns 115/122   have the device type information (UCBTYPE) for
                     the disk on which the dataset resides.
   columns 124/133   have the disk model number (e.g. "3380") for the
                     disk on which the dataset resides.
   columns 135/142   space used, in K bytes (note:  this is to the
                     nearest K byte so is more exact than the "tracks
                     used" figure)
   columns 144/151   space allocated, in K bytes (will always be a
                     multiple of the track length)

These characters appear at the end of the returned value and do not
affect programs that work with values based on column position.

Changes to the SHOW DIRECTORY command

Beginning in mid-1994, we started keeping additional information in
the directory entries of WYLBUR libraries:  we now record when a
member is created separately from when it is updated, so it is
possible to display both the create date and the last update date for
library members.  We are changing the format of the information
displayed by SHOW DIRECTORY ALL to include this information, and have
also reformatted the date fields to include full 4-digit years.  The
old and new formats are compared below.

Since many EXEC files depend on the format of this display, we have
added the NEW and OLD options to SHOW DIRECTORY ALL.  The OLD option
is the default in this new version of WYLBUR; you can use the NEW
option to get the improved display now.  On July 15, 1995, we will
change the default to NEW; therefore, any EXEC files that are
sensitive to this format should be modified before then, either to
use the new format or to include the OLD option.

Specific changes:

    * The display title has changed to show the full library name
      (i.e.,  "Directory of LIB on INT001" now displays as "Directory
      of WYL.GQ.JAN.LIB") and the volume information is no longer
      listed

    * The column "Created" (the date the file was created) has been
      added.  This column lists the file creation date immediately
      after the file name.  (This information is not available for
      files created before 1994.) The date is reported in the new
      format:  YYYY/MM/DD.

    * The "Last Updated" column (which has been incorrectly titled
      "Creation Date") now displays information in the format:
      YYYY/MM/DD  HH:MM.

      Note that WYLBUR currently displays the last updated
      information in the format HH:MM  MM/DD/YY.  That is, the date
      information appears *after* time information.

    * The column label that identifies who last updated a file has
      been renamed from "Creator" to "UserID" (there is no record of
      who created the member, only who last changed it).  Note that
      the values displayed in this column are provided by the
      processor used to modify a file and are therefore displayed
      either in Wylbur format (GG.UUU) or in TSO format (GG$UUU).
      The userid field is 8 characters; although the last two are
      usually blank, some processes store full 8-character fields
      here.

    * There is one less blank between USERID and TITLE.

    * Files created by ISPF (a TSO editor) will have some ISPF data
      displayed in the "Title" field.

The result of all these changes is that the SHOW DIRECTORY ALL
command now displays more information and supports changes necessary
to handle dates beyond 2000.  Programs that need to sort directory
information by date/time are simplified because the necessary sort
fields are now contiguous and in order of significance.
