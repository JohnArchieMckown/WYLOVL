Here is a list of WINGS error IDs that appear to be examined by WYLBUR as of
1996/09/26 (based on WYL.GS.WYL.SOURCE).  I've saved this as
WYL.GA.MCL.WINGS.LIB(ERRIDWYL).

The following are examined by WYLBUR code and trigger a prompt for a decision
from the user --

 errid   module   W*  message or prompt          reissue cmd with       Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGFMT NFILE    1   OK to change format?       CHANGFMT=YES       still being issued for PDS
DIFFVOL  NFILE    0   OK to use <newvol> anyway? VOVERIDE=YES       no longer used by WINGS
EXISTS   NFILE    1   OK to replace?             REQTYPE=REPLACE
LIBFULL  WGS      1   OK to condense?            (after condense)   could reissue EXPAND=YES
NOMEMBER NFILE    1   Scratch entire library?    WHOLEPDS=YES
NOTPDS   NFILE    1   Scratch? (SCRATCH cmd)     omit member        also on USE, SAVE; no retry
NOTYOURS NFILE    1   Password?                  PASSCHK=YES

The following are used in function calls (module FUNC) --

 errid   module   W*  converted to message       Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BADOSDSN FUNC     1   "BAD DSN"
INUSE    FUNC     1   "IN USE"
INVVOL   FUNC     0   "OFFLINE"           alias for NOTMNTD
NOACCESS FUNC     1   "NO ACCESS"
NOMEMBER FUNC     1   "BAD MEMBER"
NOTAUTH  FUNC     *   "NO ACCESS"         WINGS issues for path partner not auth.
NOTFOUND FUNC     1   "NOT THERE"
NOTINPDS FUNC     1   "BAD MEMBER"
NOTMNTD  FUNC     1   "OFFLINE"
NOVOL    FUNC     *   "OFFLINE"           WINGS issues for volume omitted from cmd when req.

*W WINGS status:

  0  Not issued by current WINGS
  1  Issued by current WINGS
  *  Issued by WINGS but with conflicting meaning

The "WINGS status" is for the newest version of WINGS (installed in TESTWING
1996/09/26).

There are only a few of these that need to be addressed in WYLBUR:

1.  The DIFFVOL errid is no longer issued by WINGS, so the code that checks
    for it may be removed after this WINGS goes production.

2.  The VOVERRIDE=YES option is no longer recognized by WINGS, so the code
    that issued "use it anyway" prompt should be removed.

3.  WINGS is now consistent in describing volume-related errors.  The errid is
    always NOTMNTD when a specified volume is not on the system.  Errid NOVOL
    is issued only to indicate a missing volume where a volume is required.
    This is unlikely as WYLBUR is probably catching the missing volume before
    passing the command to WINGS.

    WINGS does not issue INVVOL.

4.  At one point we weren't issuing the "ok to change format" prompt for a PDS
    but it appears that we are now.  Should this be fixed in WINGS, by using a
    different ERRID?  I'm assuming that WYLBUR isn't necessarily aware of the
    DSORG when the command is passed to WINGS.
