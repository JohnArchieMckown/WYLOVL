WINGS - Major commands

         FILE_ALLOCATE
         FILE_CATLG
         FILE_CLOSE
         FILE_EOF
         FILE_LSPACE
         FILE_OPEN
         FILE_RENAME
         FILE_SCRATCH
         FILE_SHOW

         RACF_REFRESH
         SHOW_DIR
         SHOW_VERSION
         UNIT_INFO

Note that one WYLBUR command may use several of these, e.g. a USE command
would do a FILE_OPEN, read some data, then do FILE_CLOSE.  See the separate
note on the WINGS protocols.


Following are the options processed by FILE_OPEN; these are also processed for
SHOW_DIR, FILE_ALLOCATE, and FILE_SHOW, (though some options are irrelevant to
some commands).  Note that commands may not be abbreviated, except where shown
explicitly.

*  ACCOUNT=account

of user requesting the service.  Always supplied by WYLBUR.  Needed for access
verification.

*  ALOCUNIT= TRK|CYL|KB|MB

for ALLOCATE command, the space quantity unit:  Tracks, Cylinders, Kbytes,
or Mbytes.

*  BLKSIZE=<VALUE>

for FILE_WRITE and ALLOCATE commands.

*  BYTECNT=byte count

for FILE_WRITE command, estimated file size in bytes; used to calculate space.

*  CATLG={YES | NO | CAT | RECAT | UNCAT}

for FILE_WRITE, ALLOCATE, and FILE_CATLG commands; default is CAT.  CAT and
YES mean the same thing; NO and UNCAT mean the same thing.

*  CHANGFMT={YES | NO}

for FILE_WRITE replace function, OK to change RECFM/LRECL?

*  CNAME=<DATA SET NAME>

The fully qualified name of "*".

*  DATACLAS=<CLASS>

for allocate and save, a data class for SMS (not in use)

*  DIRBLKS=<VALUE>

for allocate, the number of directory BLOCKS to allocate.

*  DIRMEMS=<VALUE>

for allocate, the number of directory MEMBERS to allocate.  This is converted
to blocks at the rate of 3 members per block.

*  DIRQTY=<VALUE>

for allocate, the number of directory blocks to allocate.  Replaced by the
DIRBLKS/DIRMEMS options.

*  EXPAND={YES | NO}

for library save, OK to get secondary allocation? (default=no).  Not yet used
by WYLBUR.

*  GROUP=group

used in dsname resolution; may be discontinued.

*  LINECNT=LINE COUNT

for save commands, number of lines to be written.

*  LRECL=<VALUE>

for save and allocate commands

*  MGMTCLAS=<CLASS>

for save and allocate commands, SMS management class (not yet used)

*  NAME=<DATA SET NAME>

for read, write, allocate, scratch, show dir:  the filename.

*  NTYPE={WYLBUR,TSO,EXACT,BOTH}

type of name:  WYLBUR, TSO, or fully-qualified.  For FILESHOW, affects all
dsn-type qualifiers (FROM, EXCLUDE, TO, THROUGH, LIKE), and defines the
high-level qualifier to be used (WYL.gg.uuu. or gg$uuu.) when LIKE is omitted.
BOTH is default for (and only valid with) FILESHOW; WYLBUR is default for all
other commands.

*  PASSCHK={YES | NO}

YES means that client has asked for and verified password of account that owns
the data.  used to allow access when requesting user has only read access.

*  PATHBUFL=value

Specifies the length of the client's path buffer (default is 16384) for data
seg'd to the path by WINGS.  Generally relevant only for READ requests.

*  PRIQTY=<VALUE>

for allocate, the primary allocation value

*  RECFM={F|FA|V|VA|EDIT}

for save or allocate, the record format.  Blocked records are always assumed,
thus RECFM=F really means RECFM=FB.

*  REQTYPE={READ|WRITE|APPEND|REPLACE|VERIFY|UPDATE}

type of OPEN request:

   READ, WRITE are normal use/save processing.

   APPEND is for sequential file only, and is not yet implemented.

   REPLACE is the same as WRITE but permits replacing an existing
   dataset or member.

   VERIFY does open for READ without transferring any data back to the
   client; it is used to verify usability of a file.  It can also test
   whether the caller has WRITE access to the file (see VTYPE below).

   UPDATE (not yet implemented) is used to read and then write a file.
   The file remains open after reading until the write is completed or
   the client requests a close.

*  SECQTY=<VALUE>

for allocate or save, the secondary allocation quantity.

*  SETGROUP=GROUP

*  SETLIB=<default lib>

*  SETUSER=USER

used in name resolution; may be discontinued.

*  SHARE={YES | NO}

for save, SHARE=YES opens file DISP=SHR so allows update while some other task
has file enqueued (like old NOENQ option)

*  STORCLAS=<CLASS>

for save or allocate, the SMS storage class for the file.

*  TEMP={YES | NO}

for WRITE or ALLOCATE, requests data set be saved as temporary.  Ignored for
READ.  For FILESHOW by catalog, displays only files cataloged on the defined
temporary volume(s).  For FILESHOW by volume, causes defined TEMP volumes to
be searched.

*  TITLE=<Libary member title string>

*  USER=user

used in dsname resolution, may be discontinued.

*  VOLUME=VOLSER
*  VOL=VOLSER

specifies volume for commands that use it.  For WRITE, ALLOCATE, or READ of an
uncataloged file, defines a volume to use.  For FILESHOW (from catalog),
limits display to files that are cataloged on (or a portion of which are on)
the specified volume; may be a partial volume name e.g. VOL=PUB.  For FILESHOW
from VTOC, the name of the volume to be searched.  For UNIT_INFO, the volume
serial of the unit to be displayed.  For FILE_CATLG, the volume for the
catalog entry.

*  VTYPE={READ|WRITE}

for REQTYPE=VERIFY, the type of access to verify.  VTYPE=READ (the default)
checks for READ access and opens the file for input to verify usability.
VTYPE=WRITE checks for WRITE access (and still opens the file for input).

*  WHOLEPDS={YES | NO}  (option on SCRATCH)

for scratch of entire library.



*  Table for FILE_SCRATCH special options

*  ERASE={YES|NO}

to erase the data when scratching a file (sequential or whole pds)

*  RETAIN={YES|NO}

to retain RACF profile of scratched file; default is no

*  OVRD={YES|NO}

to override expiration date when scratching file



*  Options table for SHOW DIRECTORY options

*  FROM=<Member Name>

*  LIKE=<Member Name>

*  TO  =<Member Name>

*  FORMAT={MEMBER|TERSE|HEX|ALL|OLD}

format in which directory info is returned.  options may be abbreviated to 3
characters.  MEMBER returns only member names; TERSE also shows the titles of
WYLBUR-format entries.  HEX shows the "user data" field of each entry in
hex-dump format.  ALL shows create date, last update date/time, last update
user ID, and title; for ISPF directory entries, the version/mod level, size,
initial size, and change count are shown in place of the title.
OLD mimics the old "show dir all" format, showing time and date last changed,
userid, and title.


*  Options table for FILE_SHOW

*  LIKE=<Dataset name stem>

*  {FROM|EXCLUDE}=<Dataset name stem>

*  {TO|THROUGH}=<Dataset name stem>

LIKE, FROM, EXCLUDE, TO, and THROUGH limit the range of names reported.
Default is all files stored under the caller's account.  The NTYPE option is
honored, that is, NTYPE=TSO with no other option will find datasets qualified
by GG$UUU instead of WYL.GG.UUU.  The LIKE string, when qualified, may not
exceed 40 characters for CATTYPE=VTOC.

*   REPORT={DSN|VOL|DSCB}
*  CATREPT={DSN|VOL|DSCB}

indicates the level of information returned.  DSN returns only the names; VOL
returns unit/volume info as well; DSCB returns info from DSCBs as in SHOW DSN
ALL.  For VTOC_SHOW, DSN and VOL do the same thing since unit and volume info
is always known in VTOC_SHOW.

*  CATTYPE={DISK|TAPE|DATA|GDG|ALL|VTOC}

For FILE_SHOW, the type of catalog entries to be returned:  disk files, tape
files, all dataset entries (disk+tape), GDG (and other non-dataset) info, or
all of the above.  CATTYPE=VTOC does a "show VTOC" instead of "show catalog",
searching the VTOC of a specified volume.

*  ONLY={YES | NO}

If YES, return info only about the file specified by LIKE.  Implies
REPORT=DSCB and CATTYPE=DATA.  If VOLUME is specified and the file is not
cataloged, the specified volume will be searched.

*NOTE:  When searching a VTOC, it is possible to include "wildcard" characters
in the LIKE string according to the following rules.  If the string contains
one of these characters, it can be up to 44 characters long rather than 40 as
is normally the case.  The characters are:

         *     a single * represents a single qualifier, or zero or more
               unspecified characters within a qualifier, e.g.
               WYL.GG.UUU.*.LOAD or WYL.GG.UUU.*LIB

         **    two ** represent zero or more qualifiers, e.g. SYS2.** would
               find a dataset called "SYS2" or any dataset called SYS2.xxxx
               where xxxx is any character string.

         %     represents a single unspecified character. e.g. SYS%.** would
               find all SYS datasets.

*  Options for FILE_CATLG:

FILE_CATLG requires a data set name (NAME and any related options).  The
default operation is CAT; to uncatalog or recatalog, specify CATLG=UNCAT or
CATLG=RECAT respectively.  For CAT or RECAT, the VOLUME parameter is also
required, and, if the specified volume is not online, the UNIT parameter:

*  UNIT={DISK|3380|3390|TAPE|T6250|T3420|3420|T3480|3480|T3490E|3490E}

specifies the unit type for the catalog entry.  Ignored when the specified
volume is an online disk.  For a tape dataset, you can also specify:

*  FILESEQ=<nnnn>

the file sequence number of a data set that is to be cataloged on tape.


*  Options for UNIT_INFO:

*  VOLUME=volser|UNIT=uuuu
*  FORMAT={STD|HEX|RAW}

VOLUME or UNIT indicates the device whose UCB information is to be displayed,
either the volume serial or the 3 or 4-digit unit address.  One (and only one)
of these options must be specfied.  FORMAT indicates the desired report
format:  STD (the default) is a brief formatted display of the basic UCB
information; HEX is a hexadecimal dump of the UCB base segment and common
segment; RAW is an unformatted (binary) copy of the base segment, common
segment, and, (if present) DASD extension.
