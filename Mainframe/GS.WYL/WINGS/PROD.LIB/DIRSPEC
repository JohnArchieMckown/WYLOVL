The following options may be specified for the SHOW DIRECTORY command.

NAME (included in the sample defines) is the file name, either qualified or
unqualified.

USER, GROUP, ACCOUNT may be used to qualify the name in the normal way.

VOL specifies a volume, overriding the catalog.

Options limiting the directory search:

FROM=name      Limits the directory search to names collating greater than or
               equal to the specified name.

TO=name        Limits the directory search to names collating less than or
               equal to the specified name.

LIKE=string    Limits the directory search to names beginning with the
               specified string.

               All three of these may be specified on one command, as long as
               they are consistent with each other, although it is usually
               pointless to specify LIKE with FROM and TO.

FORMAT={TERSE|HEX|OLD|ALL}  Controls the display of directory data.

         TERSE (default) shows only name (and title for WYLBUR-type entries).
         HEX   shows TTRC and a hex dump of the user data field.
         OLD   shows last update time, date, and userid, and the title (the
               old SHOW DIR ALL format)
         ALL   shows create date, last update date/time and userid, and the
               title.  Dates are in yyyy/mm/dd format.

Some things to note about the output of SHOW DIR:

1.  The ALL format is different from the current SHOW DIR ALL format; it shows
    date/time as YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM instead of the current HH:MM MM/DD/YY
    format.

2.  With the HEX, OLD, or ALL  options, the number of directory blocks
    allocated and used is reported.

3.  A "create date" stamp was added to the WYLBUR directory entries beginning
    July 1994.

4.  The create date and last update fields actually have a resolution of about
    one second (1.024 seconds, 2**10 microseconds, to be exact).  At present
    this level of precision is not displayed.
