First byte dumped is UPATFLAG, seems always to be 50 here.

000004 00              CUPATFLAG   FLAG
UPATFLAG.UPATFO   80   C           FLAG  UPATFO              - Path has opened
UPATFLAG.UPATFHDR 40   C           FLAG  UPATFHDR            - Send length word before data
UPATFLAG.UPATFSPR 20   C           FLAG  UPATFSPR            - Partner is SYS priv'd
UPATFLAG.UPATFOPR 10   C           FLAG  UPATFOPR            - Partner is OPR priv'd
UPATFLAG.UPATFWHD 08   C           FLAG  UPATFWHDR           - Send WINGS header command
UPATFLAG.UPATFAUT 04   C           FLAG  UPATFAUTH           - Partner is authorized
UPATFLAG.UPATTWAI 02   C           FLAG  UPATTWAIT           - buffer wait timer set  ML022394

So the interesting thing here is that UPATFO seems always to be OFF -- possibly it's only
set when the path is first opened?

Next four bytes are UPATSECB which doesn't look like it's being used.  Then UPATSPST
and UPATSFLG:

000088 00              CUPATSPST   DC    X'00'               Suzan post flag byte
000089 00              CUPATSFLG   DC    X'00'               Copy of Suzan post flag byte
