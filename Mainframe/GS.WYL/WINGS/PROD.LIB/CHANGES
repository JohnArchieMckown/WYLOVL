Summary of WINGS changes in Version 2.4                    1994/12/12

New features--

Support has been added for SHOW DIRECTORY, SHO DSN/CAT, SCRATCH, and ALLOCATE.
Some of these commands exist in version 2.3, but they are not used by WYLBUR
yet.  These commands support some new options that have not previously been
supported by WYLBUR.

  ALLOCATE allows space to be given in tracks, cylinders, Kbytes, or
  Mbytes.

  SCRATCH allows an ERASE option to erase residual data from scratched
  datasets.

  Wings now records both creation data and last change date in
  directory entries, and its version of SHOW DIRECTORY displays both
  dates.  Dates are displayed with 4-digit years e.g. 1994/12/31.
  SHOW DIRECTORY returns a count of blocks allocated and used.
  This is actually supported in the current WYLBUR, but has never been
  documented.

  SHOW DSN and SHOW CAT are the same command in WINGS, i.e., SHOW DSN
  is catalog-driven.  This is a significant change from how WYLBUR
  does it now.  Wings supports, in effect, a "show dsn on cat"
  command.

  Note that all of the above require implementation on the WYLBUR side
  to be effective.

Allocate and deallocate are now done with the "suppress messages" option set
(unless DEBUG is in effect); this eliminates the allocation/deallocation
messages in the WINGS job log, and will result in substantially reduced spool
usage by WINGS.

All code that uses the system clock (STCK instruction) now offsets by the
CVTTZ value, if the stored value is saved in files or displayed to users.
This supports setting the system clock correctly (i.e. to UTC).

Error handling improvements:

Corrections to "bad DSORG" error message (which was incomplete), and enabling
of "bad RECFM" message (which could never be issued).  Previously, a bad RECFM
resulted in an I/O error.  If RECFM or DSORG is undefined (all zeros), the
message indicates "data set is empty" in addition to indicating RECFM or DSORG
being undefined.

Various ERRID settings have been corrected.

There is now a DCB ABEND exit for READ, eliminating some server abends.

An allocated file will always be deallocated during command cleanup after an
error.  Files are always deallocated explicitly, rather than at CLOSE.

Internal transparent (I hope) changes:

RACF code has been moved from OSFILE to MVSUTILS.  If there are errors in this
modification, it could result in improper/lack of RACF checking.  I've tested
it, but...

The "path auth kluge" has been disabled.  If the bug it worked around
reappears, the symptom could be getting the wrong data on a USE or SAVE.
