The contents of the WINGS container is all the source for WINGS.
It was downloaded from the mainframe and underwent EBCDIC to
ASCII conversion.  The WINGS.DIRLIST file lists all the names
of the original datasets on the mainframe that were libraries.
In this environment, they are subdirectories of WINGS.  Thus:

WYL.GS.WYL.WINGS.PARMS  ->  WINGS/PARMS
WYL.GS.WYL.WINGS.PROD.LKED -> WINGS/PROD.LKED
etc.

The files within a subdirectory are the members of the library.
Hopefully you can make sense of all this.  Good Luck.
