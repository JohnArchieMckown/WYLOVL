*  work area should be initialized to zero by monitor.                  00007000
*  debugger and debuggee should re-initialize fields                    00008000
*  they control as is appropriate. (in case there has                   00009000
*  been previous debugging session, now cleared.)                       00010000
*                                                                       00011000
*  We must be careful about multi-processor environment.                00012000
*  Lock rules are complicated.  A simpler rules would                   00013000
*  be nice, but for now they are:                                       00014000
*                                                                       00015000
*  Simple rules are:                                                    00016000
*  DebuggER must obtain DBERTCBP lock (R).  Debugger can                00017000
*  change all fields that belong to debugger.  Debugger                 00018000
*  can set DebuggEE at any time, unless DebuggEE is                     00019000
*  locked (E).  Debuggee can change any debuggEE fields                 00020000
*  while it holds Debuggee lock (E).                                    00021000
*                                                                       00022000
*  A bit more complex is that if there is no debuggee,                  00023000
*  any task can jump in and become the debuggee by setting              00024000
*  itself as the DVEETCBP and obtaining the debuggEE lock (E).          00025000
*                                                                       00026000
*  Also note that either Debugger/Debuggee can set the SYMBOL           00027000
*  Table pointer if it owns the respective lock, they should            00028000
*  be setting it to the same thing.  Also POST/WAIT stuff is            00029000
*  shared between Debugger/Debuggee in a obvious fashion.               00030000
