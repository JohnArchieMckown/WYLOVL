.* DESCRIPTION
The PROGLOOK command provides a mechanism for examining the execution of a
program by CPU or elapsed time.  Monitoring is terminated when the sample
count goes to zero, the program terminates, or when you terminate the program
(e.g. CLEAR CORE, EXIT).

The following example illustrates how you might monitor the execution of a
program:

   Command> CALL program PAUSE
   Command> PROGLOOK FILE=program.proglook
   Command> GO

When the program finishes or is terminated (i.e. EXIT), the PROGLOOK monitor
file is closed.  To display the monitor data in a graphical form, do the
following:

   Command> CALL PROGPLOT LIB=ORV.GQ.RLG.MLPLIB
   PLEASE ASSIGN TO UNIT 01
   Command-> ASSIGN 01 TO FILE program.proglook RECFM=F LRECL=20 INPUT
   Command-> GO

The ACTIVE file will contain the plot information, which can then be printed
or listed.

The PROGPLOT program can be tailored by using an EDIT-format ORVYL file called
PLOTPARM that contains control fields.


   Columns      Description
     1/5        Bucket size in bytes (right justified; default is 256)
     6/10       Delete sample count (right justified; default is 0)
                   Indicates the number of additional control cards that
                   follow.  Each card specifies a range of addresses that are
                   ignored.  This is useful for programs that have "spikes".
                   The format of the cards are:

                      Columns      Description
                        1/8        CSECT (map) name
                       10/16       lower relative address in hex
                       18/24       upper relative address in hex

    11/15       Timeline switch (right justified; default is 0)
    16/20       Dump switch (right justified)
                   0 - discarded samples will not be listed (default)
                   1 - discarded samples will be listed
                   2 - no samples will be discarded

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION FILE,FILENAME
.optix FILE
FILE=filename\\\is the name of the ORVYL file to be used by PROGLOOK for
                collecting the results of monitoring.

.* OPTION APPEND,REPLACE,ERASE,SCRATCH,SHARED
.optix APPEND
.optix REPLACE
.optix ERASE
.optix SHARED
[APPEND|REPLACE|ERASE|SHARED]
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

.* OPTION SAMPLE
.optix SAMPLE
SAMPLE=limit\\\\specifies an integer for the number of samples, may be from
                zero to ten million (the default is ten million).

.* OPTION INTERVAL
.optix INTERVAL
INTERVAL=nnn\\\\specifies an integer for the sampling interval in
                milliseconds.  If intervals are CPU, this may be from ten (the
                default) to ten million milliseconds.  If intervals are REAL,
                this may be from one thousand to ten million milliseconds (the
                default is five thousand milliseconds).

.* OPTION CPU,COMPUTE,REAL
.optix CPU
.optix REAL
CPU|REAL\\\\\\\\CPU, the default, indicates samples should be taken at
                intervals of CPU time.  REAL indicates samples should be taken
                at intervals of elapsed time.

.* OPTION NOMAP
.optix NOMAP
NOMAP\\\\\\\\\\\indicates PROGLOOK is not to write the monitored program's
                external symbols and their locations to the data file.
