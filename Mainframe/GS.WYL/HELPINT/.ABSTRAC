This manual describes WYLBUR and ORVYL commands for use by systems
programmers in support of the Stanford Timesharing System at
Stanford University.  WYLBUR is a computer program that is part of
the Forsythe computer at Information Technology Systems and Services
(ITSS) at Stanford.  WYLBUR acts as a text editor and a communicator
with other parts of the system.

Since this is primarily a reference manual, it provides a description
of each WYLBUR command, including details about syntax, function,
and options.  For definitions of essential system terminology and
details about WYLBUR from a user point of view the reader is
referred to the
.italic 'WYLBUR Reference Manual.'
These command descriptions and definitions of terminology taken from
WYLBUR's online internal HELP facility.

This manual is intended for systems programmers who want an overview
of WYLBUR internal commands or who are interested in increasing
their knowledge of the program.  Those with no knowledge of WYLBUR
should begin with
.italic 'WYLBUR Overview'
or the
.italic 'WYLBUR User's Guide.'
