.* DESCRIPTION
Required Privileges:  OPERATOR or SYSTEMS


The $SHUTDOWN Command is used in shutting down the system.  It will stop or
cancel various components of the system (i.e.  ATLMS, JES2), including the
interactive systems (MILTEN, WYLBUR and ORVYL) and batch jobs.  Since the
command will kill all MILTEN lines, it should not be entered until you are
ready to take the system down.
