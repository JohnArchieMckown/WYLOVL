.* DESCRIPTION
Required Privileges:  ???

The $DUMP command allows you to put the response from any $SHOW command into
your active file.  For example, $DUMP IO (instead of $SHOW IO) places all your
data set names at the end of your active file.  WYLBUR always places the
response to a $DUMP command at the end of your active file.
