WYLBUR was first implemented on the IBM 360/67 at the Campus
Facility of the then Stanford Computation Center in 1967.  In 1970,
an MVT version of WYLBUR written by the National Institutes of
Health was installed on the IBM 360/91 at the SLAC Facility; there
it was the object of substantial development effort.  This extended
version was then called SLAC/WYLBUR.

In 1973, SLAC/WYLBUR was converted to run under VS2 Release 1 (SVS)
on the IBM 370/158 at Encina Hall, Stanford Campus.  Subsequently
this version of WYLBUR, Stanford WYLBUR, was enhanced and together
with Stanford's timesharing monitor ORVYL and terminal
communications interface MILTEN, were introduced as the Stanford
Timesharing System.  In 1975 the system was upgraded to an IBM
370/168, which was converted to an IBM 3033 in 1979.  In 1981 the
Stanford Timesharing System was converted to an IBM 3081 to run
under IBM's current release of VS2, MVS, which was upgraded in 1983
to the current MVS/XA.

WYLBUR was extended considerably during these years.  A System News
facility was installed in 1978, and in 1980 an Electronic Mail
facility was added.  Online HELP was installed in 1981.  Other
extensions to WYLBUR include supporting the Integrated Catalog
Facility and adding Page mode editing in 1983, integrated
microcomputer file transfer support using a program called Samson
and a spelling checker facility in 1984.  Now this complete
interactive service is offered to the users of Information
Technology Services (ITS) on the current &machine system.

Many enhancements to WYLBUR were originally designed and implemented
at Stanford.  Included among those who have made important
contributions to WYLBUR development are John Borgelt, Brian Cox,
Mike Durket, Roger Fajman, Carol Farlow, Bill Frazier, Parker
Gillespie, Vicki Griffeth, John Halperin, Charley Hoyt, Bruce Hunt,
Steve Kunz, Carol Lennox, Rich Levitt, Jim Nisbet, Ed Russell, and
Joe Wells.  Additional extensions were originally implemented at
Columbia University, the National Institutes of Health, and Iowa
State University.

This reference manual for WYLBUR internal commands was originally
drafted by Lincoln Ong of the Systems Group in 1984.  Susan Plass
found Lincoln's draft and updated and completed it.  Many thanks
to Lincoln for providing the substatial base from which this work
was developed.
