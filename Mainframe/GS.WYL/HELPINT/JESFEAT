$SHUTDOWN Command
This command has beend added to the system to help in shutting the
system down.  It will stop or cancel various components of the
system, including the interactive systems.  Since the command will
kill all WYLBUR lines, it should not be entered untill you are ready
to take the system down.  Currently the command will not take down
ALTMS.  To do this, you still have to reply 'STOP TLMS' to the ATLMS
reply message.  Also, this command will not take JES2 down.  To do
this, you still have to use the $PJES2 command, after all active
jobs and system tasks have terminated.
