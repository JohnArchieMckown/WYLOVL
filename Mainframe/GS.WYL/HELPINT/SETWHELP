Required Privileges:  SYSTEMS

The SET WHELP command refreshes the HELP Directory Table that is kept in
memory.  Whenever the data set WYL.GA.PUB.HELPDIR is replaced, this command is
automatically issued.  You would only use this command to update the HELP
Directory Table if it is shared between multiple systems.
