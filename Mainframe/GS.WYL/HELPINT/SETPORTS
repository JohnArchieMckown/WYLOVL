.* DESCRIPTION
Required Privileges:  OPERATOR or SYSTEMS

The SET PORT command temporarily alters the current port information block for
a particular line.  Some of the options also change the status of the port
itself, or of the charging algorithms applied to the port.  Any permanent
changes should be put into the MILTEN Ports Definition Table.

.* SELECT 'SET PORT Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION PORT-ID,N,TID,UUU,GG.UUU,'NAME'
.ix port-id 'on SET PORT Command'
port-id\\\\\\\\\is the line address.  Type HELP PORT-ID for a description of
                port-id.

.* OPTION MULTIPLE
.optix MULTIPLE
MULTIPLE\\\\\\\\specifies that the command applies to every port of an
                abbreviated group or front end (i.e., SET PORT 11 MULTIPLE
                NODIAL).

.* OPTION TRAN,NOTRAN
.optix TRAN
.optix NOTRAN
                [Obsolete]
TRAN|NOTRAN\\\\\TRAN specifies that the port is connect via the TRAN switch.
                NOTRAN specifies that the port is not connected via the TRAN
                switch.

.* OPTION DIRECT,NODIRECT
.optix DIRECT
.optix NODIRECT
DIRECT|NODIRECT\DIRECT specifies that the port is a directly connected port
                and MILTEN should not drop the port when the session ends.
                NODIRECT specifies that the port is not a directly connected
                port.

.* OPTION LEASED,NOLEASED
.optix LEASED
.optix NOLEASED
LEASED|NOLEASED\LEASED specifies that there are to be no session connect
                charges (bulk rate).  NOLEASED specifies that there should be
                session connect charges.  These options affect the charging
                algorithm.

.* OPTION DIAL,NODIAL
.optix DIAL
.optix NODIAL
DIAL|NODIAL\\\\\DIAL indicates that port is a dial-up port.  NODIAL indicates
                that the port is not a dial-up port.

.* OPTION TELENET,NOTELENET
.optix TELENET
.optix NOTELENET
TELENET|NOTELENET
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\TELENET specifies that the port is connected via Telenet.
                NOTELENET specifies that the port is not connected via
                Telenet.  These options affect the charging algorithm.

.* OPTION ID
.optix ID
ID='NCC-location'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the NCC (Network Control Center) location that the
                Data Communications group has assigned to the port.  The NCC
                location can be up to 20 characters long.

.* OPTION LOC
.optix LOC
LOC=location\\\\specifies the location of the port that can be up to 20
                characters long.

.* OPTION ATTACHED,DETACHED
.optix ATTACHED
.optix DETACHED
ATTACHED|DETACHED
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ATTACHED specifies that the port is to be attached and
                sessions can use the port.  DETACHED specifies that the port
                is to be detached and any new sessions are to be disallowed.
                These options actually affect the port's status.

.* OPTION VERIFY
.optix VERIFY
VERIFY\\\\\\\\\\displays the changes and prompts the user to verify any
                changes.  A positive response (Y, YES, OK) accepts the
                changes.
