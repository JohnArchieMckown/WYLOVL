.* FUNCTION
The SET MASTER command adds or changes the attributes for an
account.  If a new account is to be created, the parameters for the
new account are defaulted to those of the template account in the
group (gg.PUB).  Thus, by setting the permanent options for the
group public account, the Accounting office or the Group
Administrator can control the defaults a new account in his group
will receive.

The group administrator (a user with ADMIN privileges) can handle
some of the account maintenance functions for accounts in his
group.  The group administrator can issue the following commands
(described in the WYLBUR Manual) for any account in his group
without having to supply the keyword:

  SHOW OPTIONS gg.uuu
  SET AUTO gg.uuu    -and-  SHOW AUTO gg.uuu
  SET JOB gg.uuu     -and-  SHOW JOB gg.uuu
  SET OUTPUT gg.uuu  -and-  SHOW OUTPUT gg.uuu

                specified then "gg.PUB" is assumed.  (If there is no
                "gg.PUB" account then some general assumptions are
                made.)
