.chapter 'Global Options'
.ix 'global options'
Global options are options you can specify once during a WYLBUR session rather
than for every command to which they apply.  WYLBUR specifies default values
for the global options (that is, they are in effect "by default"), but you can
change them with a SET command.  For example, the default line length used by
WYLBUR is 72 characters.  You may change this to, say, 133 characters, with
the SET LENGTH command.  During the rest of your terminal session, the default
line length in any command that includes a LENGTH option would be 133 rather
than 72 (unless you override it).  For instance, if you issue the command
JUSTIFY 10/15, WYLBUR justifies lines 10 through 15 to a line length of 133.

You can display the current value of any of the global options with the
appropriate SHOW command.  For example, the command SHOW LENGTH, displays the
current value of the line length.

The following table summarizes some of the global options.  Each command is
described in detail in Part II.
