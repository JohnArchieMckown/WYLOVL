* 4/15/84  SET SPIFILE COMMAND PROVIDES MORE ORVYL FILE SECURITY

A new set of ORVYL commands, SET SPIFILE, SET NOSPIFIL and SHOW
SPIFILE, can be used to block read access to SPIRES files by
non-SPIRES ORVYL programs.  Specifically, the SET SPIFILE command,
whose syntax is:

     SET SPIFILE orvyl.dataset.name

tells ORVYL not to allow access to the named ORVYL data set by any
program other than the public SPIRES programs (including SPIBILD,
SPICOMP, SPISRCH, SPIUTIL, and batch SPIBILD) by any user other than
the file owner.  Access by non-SPIRES programs (as well as batch
SPIRES and batch FASTBILD and the test versions of all SPIRES
programs) is blocked.

Note that write access to all data sets except the DEFQ by
non-SPIRES programs has always been blocked by default, as has read
and write access by users who do not go through SPIRES security.
For more information on ORVYL data set security, EXPLAIN SET SPIFILE
COMMAND.
