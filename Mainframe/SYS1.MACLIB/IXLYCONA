                         attributes specified. This may be the result  *06894610
                         of the initial allocation size being too      *06894620
                         small, the maximum structure size being too   *06894630

                         scenario is that the initial structure size   *06894650
                         was calculated based on a CF with a CFLEVEL   *06894660
                         different from where the structure was        *06894670

CONARSNREBLDDUPLEXOTHER EQU 16 Reason: A previous duplexing rebuild    *06901100
                         was stopped by an operator, the CFRM policy   *06902400

                         placed in this facility because the operator  *06907600
                         requested that it be moved out of the         *06908900
                         facility by stopping the previous rebuild.    *06910200
                         Action: Make sure there is another suitable   *06911500

CONARSNFACILITYPOPCFNOTSUITABLE EQU 17 Reason: Facility was not        *06914100

CONARSNIMPLIEDREBLDOTHER EQU 18 Reason: Facility was not selected      *06933100
                         because it holds the rebuild old structure,   *06933200
                         and since there is no policy chg pending, the *06933300
                         rebuild assumes that a MOVE of the structure  *06933400
                         is required                                    06933500

                         an original connector or for the current set  *06933800

CONARSNINSUFFUSERLIMIT EQU 21 Reason: Facility was not selected        *06934400

CONARSNSTRLIMITSTOOSMALL EQU 22 Reason: Facility was not selected      *06934700
                         because its structure limits (e.g., number of *06934800
                         castout classes, storage classes, list        *06934900
                         headers, or lock users) are less than those   *06935000
                         in use in the old structure                    06935100
CONARSNBADALLOCATERESULTS EQU 23 Reason: An attempt to allocate a      *06935200
                         structure in the facility resulted in a       *06935300
                         structure with attributes (e.g., size or      *06935400
                         object counts) less suitable than the old     *06935500

                         entries, elements, list headers, etc), the    *06935900
                         operation failed, or it returned a computed   *06936000
                         maximum structure size that was larger than   *06936100
