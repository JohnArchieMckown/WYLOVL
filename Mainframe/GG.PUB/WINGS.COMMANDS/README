The following memo describes commands that may be used to invoke certain new
features in WINGS.  These features will eventually be used by WYLBUR and will
replace the corresponding "OLDIBM" code in WYLBUR.  This code should be
considered to be in alpha-test mode.  Please report bugs to Mark Lawrence.

Commands are available to perform the ALLOCATE, SCRATCH, and SHOW DIRECTORY
functions.  You can use DEFINE commands like the following:

def walc as 'xc wyl.gg.pub.wings.commands#allocate/name='
def wscr as 'xc wyl.gg.pub.wings.commands#scratch /name='
def wdir as 'xc wyl.gg.pub.wings.commands#showdir/name='

These commands are saved as wyl.gg.pub.wings.commands#defines.  This note is
saved as wyl.gg.pub.wings.commands#readme.

The following options may be specified for the ALLOCATE, SCRATCH, and SHOW
DIRECTORY commands.  Some options are not relevant to some commands.

Please note that the interface described here is not intended to be an
interface for general users; it is in fact the interface between WINGS and
WYLBUR, and is describe here so that systems programmers may exercise the new
code.  I have no objection to passing this information to selected users, as
long as you are confident that the user is a good alpha-tester, with all that
implies.

Options may not be abbreviated.

NAME (included in the sample defines) is the file name, either qualified or
unqualified.

USER, GROUP, ACCOUNT may be used to qualify the name in the normal way.

RECFM, LRECL, BLKSIZE may be used with ALLOCATE.

PRIQTY, SECQTY, DIRQTY are used with ALLOCATE.  If DIRQTY is omitted, a
sequential data set is allocated.  If PRIQTY is omitted, a file the size of
the current active file is allocated.  If SECQTY is omitted, default secondary
is zero (see note below).

ALOCUNIT={TRK|CYL|KB} Specifies the units of PRIQTY and SECQTY in ALLOCATE.
KB is the default.  The current implementation interprets "KB" as "blocks of 1
KB", which over-allocates.  This will be corrected to mean "kbytes, using a
good blksize" in the near future.

VOL specifies a volume, overriding the catalog for SHOW DIR or SCRATCH, and
defining a target volume for ALLOCATE.  For ALLOCATE, if VOL is omitted then
the file will be allocated on the LIB volume if possible.

DATACLAS, MGMTCLAS, STORCLAS may be specified with ALLOCATE, but in our
current environment will usually cause an allocation failure.

WHOLEPDS={YES|NO} is used with SCRATCH (NO is the default).  WHOLEPDS=YES must
be specified to scratch an entire library.

The following options apply only to SHOW DIRECTORY:

FROM=name      Limits the directory search to names collating greater than or
               equal to the specified name.
TO=name        Limits the directory search to names collating less than or
               equal to the specified name.
LIKE=string    Limits the directory search to names beginning with the
               specified string.

               All three of these may be specified on one command, as long as
               they are consistent with each other, although it is usually
               pointless to specify LIKE with FROM and TO.

FORMAT={TERSE|HEX|ALL}  Controls the display of directory data.

         TERSE (default) shows only name (and title for WYLBUR-type entries).
         HEX   shows TTRC and a hex dump of the user data field.
         ALL   shows last update date/time and userid, as well as the title.

Some things to note about the output of SHOW DIR:

1.  The ALL format is different from the current SHOW DIR ALL format; it shows
    date/time as YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM instead of the current HH:MM MM/DD/YY
    format.  This format is tentative and subject to change.  I'm also
    considering adding an option to display in the old format.

2.  In the current version, the number of directory blocks allocated and used
    is reported, regardless of the FORMAT option.  The current SHOW DIR
    command will not report this information at all.  I will change this so
    that FORMAT=TERSE does not display this information.

3.  I'm contemplating adding a "create date" stamp to the WYLBUR directory
    entries; this would require further changes in the format of SHOW DIR
    output.  I'm also considering displaying the timestamp as hh:mm:ss, since
    the information actually has a resolution of about one second (2**10
    microseconds, really).  Comments are welcome.


Other non-transparent changes:

1.  Current ALLOCATE command provides a secondary allocation value, but
    current SAVE logic will not use it.  The new ALLOCATE defaults to zero
    secondary, and I have added an EXPAND={YES|NO} option to the internal OPEN
    command used for SAVE.  EXPAND=YES will allow use of an existing secondary
    value; it should also be possible to provide an overriding secondary value
    on the SAVE command.  These require changes on the WYLBUR side to become
    effective.  My intention is that EXPAND=YES be the default, and that those
    who don't want their libraries to grow should allocate them with no
    secondary.  I have a program that can be used to set the secondary
    allocation value of an existing library to zero.  Further discussion is
    probably warranted here.

2.  SHOW DIR SCRATCH is not implemented in WINGS.  If anyone thinks we really
    need this, they can write an execfile.

3.  SHOW DIR TABLE is not implemented in WINGS, it could be done in an
    execfile or in WYLBUR.

4.  SHOW DSN SCRATCH will not be implemented in WINGS.
