                       <.b+>Using Lindy<.b->

Lindy is a Vax/Unix system that is primarily used as a front-end
computer to provide network mail support.  It is up pretty much all
the time, and user files are backed up about once a month.

To login to Lindy, when you get the "enter class" prompt type
"lindy" (all in lower case).  If you are not running at 9600 baud
then you will see a few characters of garbage, and you will need to
press RETURN until you get the message:

      Welcome to Stanford 4.2 Vax/Unix, Lindy

      login:

at this point type your account, (usually your initials).  Then
answer the prompt:

      Password:

with your password.  The next prompt you should get is:

      Lindy>

You are now logged in!

It is important to remember that case (as in uppercase or lowercase)
matters to Lindy.  A file named "SAMPLE" and a file named "sample"
are two different files to Unix.  Also, a command called "finger"
and a command called "FINGER" are different commands.  The general
convention in Unix is to put everything in lower case, (commands,
all your file names, etc.)

Here is a brief list of Unix commands with their corresponding
WYLBUR commands:


    Lindy                             WYLBUR
 -------------------------         -----------------------------
 finger                            SHOW LINES
 finger uuu                        SHOW LINE gg.uuu

 ls                                SHOW DSNAMES/SHOW CATALOG

 passwd                            SET PASSWORD

 more filename                     LIST FROM filename

 mail xxx                          MAIL TO xxx
 mail                              SHOW MAIL

 man subject (<-- "man" means      HELP subject
                show the manual
                for xxxx)
 learn                             HELP, kind of... try learn!

 imprint filename                  PRINT FROM filename

 logout                            LOGOFF


<.u+>Using TeX<.u->
Once you have a text file on Lindy with TeX control information in
it, you can go through the following sequence:

    Lindy> tex sample
    [A bunch of TeX messages come out.  This process takes your
     file, called "sample.tex" and makes a file called "sample.dvi"
     which is the output file.]

    Lindy> iptex sample
    [This program takes the file "sample.dvi" and queues it for
     print on the Imagen print in Cypress.  It stands for "Imagen
     Print Tex" -- "IPTEX".]

<.u+>File Transfer<.u->
It is a fairly simple procedure to transfer a file from another
machine.  Use the program called "FTP" (file transfer program).  For
example, if I had a file called <G.NIZ>SAMPLE.TEX at Score and I
wanted to copy it to Lindy, I would issue the commands:


    Lindy> ftp score
    220 SCORE FTP Server process now ready. (Something like that.)
    Name (su-score.arpa:niz): g.niz   <-- my Score account
    Password (su-score.arpa:niz):     <-- my Score password
    331 User name ok. Password, please.
    230 User G.NIZ now logged in.
    ftp> get                          <-- I want a file
    (remote file) sample.tex          <-- the name on Score
    (local file) sample.tex           <-- the name I want it called
                                                         ...on Lindy
    200 File transferred, it took xxx seconds.
    ftp> quit
    Done.
    Lindy> more sample.tex            <-- list the file at the
    ....                                                 ...terminal
