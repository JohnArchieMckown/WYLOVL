Hibal folks,

Re: New ASMEDIT

I wrote a new ASMEDIT (in HIBAL) a couple of weeks ago.  The source
is currently saved as WYL.GG.JDN.ASMEDIT.  The new version is
"Asmedit 3", and can be obtained by using the STEPLIB:

         //STEPLIB DD DSN=WYL.GG.SYS.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR

If you want to use the previous version (Asmedit 2.98) then specify
"PGM=ASMEDIT2" with the STEPLIB to WYL.GG.SYS.LINKLIB.  On the
HIBALxx procs you can specify "ASMEDIT=ASMEDIT2".

What's new?

I hope that you will find the new output format to be more compact
and readable...  it reduced the size of the WYLBUR listings by about
35%!

It generally uses one line per statement (showing as much code
as possible, and appending a "_" if it can't fit all the generated
code on the left side).  In addition, the Wylbur line-number
(columns 73/80) replaces the statement number.

A single line with just an "*" on it separated by two code lines now
gets replaced with a blank line.

ASMEDIT control lines can be in upper or lower case.

There is a new *BOX statement:

         *box
         *
         *   This is a routine.
         *

which produces...

         *************************************************
         *                                               *
         *   This is a routine.                          *
         *                                               *
         *************************************************
         <... one blank line ...>


In addition, if you have comments:

         *-
         *-           Mini-comment.
         *-

You will get an indented boxed comment:

                      *******************
                      *  Mini-comment.  *
                      *******************

This is nice for HIBAL because your code (including comments will
conform to the indentation).  Thanks to Parker for this idea.

And finally, a single line with just "*-" will produce a dashed
separator line.

There are two new debuging ASMEDIT control cards "*NOEDIT" and
"*EDIT".  In *NOEDIT mode no reformatting is done.  Generally,
"*GEN" is sufficient.

Please let me know if there are problems.  Thanks.

P.S.  I wrote a short exec to change Wylbur subroutine headers to
use the *BOX and *- style comments.  It is saved as
WYL.GG.JDN.LIB#HIFIX.
