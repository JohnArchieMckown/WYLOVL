        <.b+>Communicating Across The Network<.b->


[At the time of this writing this support is still considered
experimental and therefore subject to change without notice.]

The NET procedures documented here provide a mechanism for communicating to
other computers across the network.  Among other things, these procedures
facilitate access to computers on the internet via TCP/IP.  This is an
advanced use of extended EXECs.  The SYSCALL command is used in extended
EXECs to call these system procedures.

The terminology used here is briefly listed below:


net         a "net" is established between two sessions to allow
            communications over TCP/IP.  The connection may exist
            between two different computers or the same computer.
            A TCP/IP connection consists of "my IP address,my TCP
            port number" on one side and "your IP address,your TCP
            port number" on the other.

netno       a number associated with the net.  Each net is
            assigned a number when it is first opened.  This number
            must be used with all subsequent calls to identify the
            net.  The function calls are listed below.

return      each net call returns a return code.  If the call
code (rc)   executes successfully, the return code is set to 'OK'.
            A list of return codes is included at the end of this
            document.

The operations you can perform on a net are NET_OPEN, NET_CLOSE, NET_READ,
NET_READFILE, NET_WRITE, NET_WRITEFILE, NET_CONTROL, and NET_STATUS.

<.page>
<.b+>SYSCALL NET_OPEN (netno, option-string, rc)<.b->

Opens a TCP/IP connection to the IP address and port specified.
The computer which resides at the IP address is considered the
host.

netno   a numeric variable into which the net number will be put upon
         completion of the open.  The variable may have any name, but must
         exist before the syscall to NET_OPEN.  You use this variable to
         specify the net number on subsequent calls to this net.

option-string
         a string, enclosed in quotes, specifying any or all of the
         following options:

         WAIT=n          wait for "n" seconds for a partner to connect.  After
                         "n" seconds, terminate with a return code of "TIMEOUT".
                         The default (without the WAIT option) is to wait
                         indefinitely.

         NOWAIT          immediately return, this can be used for polling
                         the host computer.

         HOST            the internet name (LINDY.STANFORD.EDU) or address
                         (36.54.0.11) of the host computer with which to
                         establish a connection.

         PORT            the port number to connect on the host computer.

         CHAR            perform character i/o over the net.  This seems
                         mainly useful where terminal i/o may be performed
                         such as the RN command or the MAN command.

         LINE            perform i/o using a full line.  Geared toward the
                         case where i/o is to and from the active file.

         INDATA=[CRLF | LF]
                         indicate what marks the end of a line for
                         incoming data.  By default a CRLF (x'0d25')
                         marks the end of a line.

         OUTDATA=[CRLF | LF]
                         indicate what marks the end of a line for
                         outgoing data.  By default a CRLF (x'0d25')
                         marks the end of a line.

         PRIVILEGED      Specifies that your port address is to be a
                         "privileged" port number (a number between
                         0 and 1023).  Only authorized execs can
                         specify this option; if a normal user exec
                         specifies this option it will be ignored.

         VTAM            ? A VTAM session.
         IAC             ?
         NOIAC           ?
         TERMINAL        ? A terminal connection.
         PASSIVE         ?

rc       a string variable into which the return code will be put on
         completion of the OPEN.  A return code of "OK" means that the net
         was successfully opened.  The variable may have any name, but must
         exist before the syscall to NET_OPEN.

<.page>
<.b+>SYSCALL NET_READ (netno, option-string, read-string, rc)<.b->

Reads (receives) information from the net.

netno   specifies the net-number of an open net.  (This can be
         the variable used in NET_OPEN.)

option-string
         a string, enclosed in quotes, in which you can specify the
         WAIT=n option, which waits until there is data to be read.

         WAIT=n          wait for "n" seconds for the host to respond.  After
                         "n" seconds, terminate with a return code of "TIMEOUT".
                         The default (without the WAIT option) is to wait indefinitely.

         NOWAIT          immediately return.

         a string variable into which a line of text will be returned.

rc       the variable into which the return code is put.
         'OK' indicates a successful completion


<.b+>SYSCALL NET_READFILE (netno, option-string, read-count, rc)<.b->

the current active file.

         the variable used in NET_OPEN.)

option-string
         a string, enclosed in quotes which may contain the following
         options.

         WAIT=n          wait for "n" seconds for the host to respond.  After
                         "n" seconds, terminate with a return code of "TIMEOUT".
                         The default (without the WAIT option) is to wait indefinitely.

         NOWAIT          immediately return.

         COUNT=n         The maximum number of lines which can be read into
                         the active file.  If the maximum is reached
                         terminate with a return code of "COUNT EXHAUSTED".

         START=ln        The line number in the active file to start reading
                         the lines.

         EOF='<string>'  a string which acts as a delimiter as the end of the
                         file.  The read terminates with a return code of "EOF"
                         when a line matches the string.  Note that the string
                         must be on a line by itself with no other text.

         able to receive data.

         WAIT=n          wait for "n" seconds for the host to respond.  After
                         "n" seconds, terminate with a return code of "TIMEOUT".
                         The default (without the WAIT option) is to wait
                         indefinitely.

         a string or string variable containing the string to be
         sent over the net.  If necessary concatenate CRLF (x'0d25') or
         just LF (x'25') in accordance with the INDATA and OUTDATA parameters

<.b+>Return codes from SYSCALL Procedures<.b->

The SYSCALL NET macros return the following return codes:

    'OK'                call completed successfully

    'ATTN'              an attention occurred during a net operation.

    'RESET'             the host is not responding

    'TIMEOUT'           SYSCALL timed out without processing.  Controlled
                        by the WAIT option on most NET_ calls.

    'MSG BUFFER FULL'   the message buffer is full -- you must
                        wait until your partner has READ some
                        messages before you can send more.

    'END OF FILE'       a read received and end of file indication.

    'NO PARTNER'        your partner has not opened the net.

    'TOO BIG'           the text you are trying to send is too big
                        for the buffer.

    'NOT OPEN'          the specified net is not open.

    'BAD NET NUMBER'   the specified number is not a valid net
                        number.

    'NO DATA'           there is no data to be read.

    'NET CLOSED'       the specified net has been closed.

    'INVALID OPTION'    the order of the parameters on the SYSCALL
                        are incorrect, or the specified option is
                        not valid on that procedure.

    'NOT IMPLEMENTED'   option not implemented.

    'ERROR'
                        these error messages indicate an internal
                        error in the procedure and should never
                        appear.
