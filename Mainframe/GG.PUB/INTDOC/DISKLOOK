DISKLOOK consists of four modules assembled and link-edited separately.  That
is, each source member produces a load module (which may contain more than one
CSECT and may have some static linkage to other modules, such as IOPROGM's
parser).  At execution time, DISKLOOK links to the other modules dynamically.
Source members are in WYL.GA.MCL.UTILITY.SRC and are:

  DISKLOOK -- main program
  GTDSCB   -- read VTOCs
  DSKALOCD -- dynamically allocate a volume
  ACCTCONV -- convert an "account" or "userid" to dataset qualifier(s)

JCL is in WYL.GA.MCL.LIB:

ASMDISKL assemble and link DISKLOOK, private loadlib
UP#DISKT move private copy into system TEST library
UP#DISKL move system PROD copy to BACK, TEST version to PROD
ASMACON  assemble and link ACCTCONV into system test loadlib
ASMACONX assemble and link ACCTCONV into private loadlib
ASMGDSCB assemble and link GTDSCB

At present the DSKALOCD source contains the asm&link JCL as well.

The version of ACCTCONV in the source lib is a test version not yet in
production; I was working on it to handle TSO-style userids as well as
WYL.GG.UUU style.  At any rate you shouldn't need to change it.

User documentation is in DOC#DISKLOOK PUBLIC.

Loadlibs are SYS4.APF.*.LINKLIB where * is PROD, TEST, or BACK.

When working on UCB stuff, be aware that source comments may still show some
obsolete or unused options.  Back in MVT days, this program could run without
doing an OPEN (built its own DEB).  There may still be residues of that code
left here and there (but not really used now).
