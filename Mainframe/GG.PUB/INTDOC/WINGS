Production load library is SYS2.WINGS.PROD.LOAD; test library is
SYS2.WINGS.TEST.LOAD, back is SYS2.WINGS.BACK.LOAD.  WINGS is a started task,
so proc is in SYS1.PROCLIB.

Production source is WYL.GG.WYL.WINGS.SOURCE, maclib WYL.GG.WYL.WINGS.MACLIB.

Various JCLs and stuff are in WYL.GG.WYL.WINGS.PROD.LIB.  There are also various
JCLs and execfiles in WINGS.SOURCE in members with names beginning with a dot.
These should be considered to be of historical interest only; any that I use
are in WINGS.LIB A number of useful commands/xprocs are in
WYL.GG.WYL.WINGS.COMMANDS, for example, I have defined

DB - xcall wyl.gg.wyl.wings.commands#db /...

which I use to debug WINGS.  The debugger can be used to cancel and restart
WINGS servers.

Typically there is a WINGS and a TESTWING running.  For any given WYLBUR, the
choice is determined by the WFPATH setting, i.e., SET WFPATH TESTWING sets
TESTWING as the server for whichever WYLBUR the command was issued from (for
ALL users of that WYLBUR).  To set the path only for your session, use SET
FPATH.

If WINGS is hung, the best recovery path is to start another one.  After
waiting a few minutes, the old one can be cancelled.  If individual servers
are hung, they can be cancelled and restarted using the debug commands.

The listings are normally on the shelf behind my terminal, in three binders
(OLD, PROD, and TEST).
