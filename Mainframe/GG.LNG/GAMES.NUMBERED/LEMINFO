REM WYL.GA.PAB.BASIC.GAMES#LEMINFO, CREATED 04/14/76                       0.
               LEM -- A LUNAR LANDING SIMULATION                           1.
                                                                           2.
                                                                           3.
YOU ARE THE PILOT OF A LUNAR LANDER (LEM).  INITIALLY YOUR LEM IS          4.
SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE LUNAR SURFACE AND IS HURTLING STRAIGHT      5.
DOWN TOWARDS IT, PICKING UP SPEED AS IT FALLS, WITH ITS ROCKET             6.
ENGINES TURNED OFF.  YOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO MAKE A SOFT LANDING ON THE       7.
MOON.  THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO BRAKE YOUR FALL WITH IS YOUR             8.
ROCKET ENGINE.  YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHEN TO TURN IT ON AND HOW MUCH         9.
THRUST TO USE.  ONCE A SECOND YOU GET A CHANCE TO CHANGE YOUR MIND        10.
AND USE A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF THRUST.  AT THE END OF EVERY SECOND OF      11.
YOUR FLIGHT THE COMPUTER WILL TELL YOU HOW HIGH YOU ARE, HOW FAST         12.
YOU ARE FALLING, AND HOW MUCH FUEL IS LEFT.                               13.
                                                                          14.
1. ABOUT YOUR ENGINE.   YOUR ENGINE HAS TWO LIMITATIONS: THERE IS A       15.
   MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THRUST IT CAN EXERT, AND THERE IS A LIMITED          16.
   AMOUNT OF FUEL ON BOARD.  ONCE YOUR FUEL IS GONE YOU FALL LIKE A       17.
   BRICK.  YOU HAVE ENOUGH EXCESS TO GIVE A SAFETY FACTOR, BUT NOT        18.
   ENOUGH TO BE SLOPPY.                                                   19.
                                                                          20.
2. HOW TO SPECIFY YOUR THRUST.   THE FORCE OF YOUR THRUST IS DETERMINED   21.
   BY THE AMOUNT OF FUEL BURNED EACH SECOND IN YOUR ENGINE.  AT THE END   22.
   OF EACH SECOND OF YOUR FLIGHT YOUR TERMINAL WILL EXPECT AN INPUT       23.
   IN THE COLUMN LABELLED 'NEXT BURN'. YOU MUST THEN TYPE THE NUMBER OF   24.
   UNITS OF FUEL YOU WANT BURNED DURING THE NEXT SECOND.  MORE FUEL       25.
   EQUALS MORE THRUST.                                                    26.
                                                                          27.
3. DEFINITION OF 'UNIT OF FUEL'.  THE EFFECT OF BURNING ONE UNIT OF       28.
   FUEL PER SECOND IS TO REDUCE YOUR ACCELERATION TOWARDS THE MOON        29.
   BY ONE FOOT PER SECOND EACH SECOND.  SINCE LUNAR GRAVITY CAUSES        30.
   YOUR LEM TO ACCELERATE 5 FT/SEC EACH SECOND, THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU    31.
   BURN 5 UNITS OF FUEL PER SECOND LUNAR GRAVITY WILL BE CANCELLED AND    32.
   YOUR SPEED WILL NOT CHANGE DURING THAT SECOND.  TO SLOW DOWN, YOUR     33.
   BURN MUST BE LARGER THAN 5 UNITS/SEC.  LESS THAN 5 UNITS               34.
   MEANS A SPEED-UP.                                                      35.
                                                                          36.
4. HOW SOFT IS 'SOFT'?   YOUR LANDING WILL BE CONSIDERED SOFT IF YOUR     37.
   SPEED AT TOUCHDOWN IS 5 FT/SEC OR LESS.  IF YOU HIT TOO HARD, ALL IS   38.
   NOT LOST.  THE PROGRAM CAN BE RESTARTED WITH THE OLD INITIAL VALUES F  39.
   HEIGHT, SPEED, AND FUEL SUPPLY AND, UNLIKE REAL LIFE, YOU CAN TRY      40.
   AGAIN.  TO DO THIS RESPOND WITH A '3' WHEN A VALUE OPTION IS REQUESTE  41.
   IF YOU RESPOND WITH A '2', THEN NEW VALUES WILL BE TRIED.              42.
                                                                          43.
5. IF IT'S HARD TO LAND ON THE MOON YOU SHOULD TRY IT ON EARTH.  AND YOU  44.
   CAN IF YOU WANT TO.  SUPPLY A '2' FOR THE LOCATION OPTION IN           45.
   ORDER TO CHANGE TO EARTH GRAVITATION.  SINCE GRAVITATIONAL ACCELERA-   46.
   TION ON EARTH IS 32 FT/SEC/SEC, YOU MUST BURN MORE THAN 32 UNITS OF    47.
   FUEL PER SECOND TO SLOW DOWN.                                          48.
                                                                          49.
6. HELPFUL (?) TABLES.   YOU MAY FIND IT HELPFUL TO HAVE SOME INFORMA-    50.
   TION ON THE WAY A BODY FALLS FROM REST ON THE MOON (OR EARTH).  IF     51.
   YOU RESPOND TO THE TABLE OPTION BY TYPING '1', YOUR TERMINAL WILL PRO  52.
   DUCE A TABLE SHOWING, AT ONE SECOND INTERVALS, THE DISTANCE A BODY     53.
   HAS FALLEN BELOW ITS INITIAL HEIGHT AND THE SPEED IT HAS REACHED.      54.
                                                                          55.
7. FOR THE NOVICE.   IF YOU HAVE NEVER USED THIS PROGRAM BEFORE YOU       56.
   SHOULD EXPERIMENT WITH A STANDARD SITUATION FIRST.                     57.
   BY SUPPLYING A '1' FOR THE VALUE OPTION, YOU WILL ALWAYS GET           58.
   THE SAME INITIAL VALUES.  ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE STANDARD GAME     59.
   YOU CAN (A) IMPRESS YOUR DATE WITH YOUR SKILL, AND (B) MOVE ON TO      60.
   MORE INTERESTING THINGS.                                               61.
                                                                          62.
8. HAPPY LANDINGS.                                                        63.
     NOW TYPE 'CLEAR TEXT' THEN 'CALL BASIC'                              64.
     THEN 'USE BASIC.GAMES#LEM ON PUB003 ACCOUNT PAB$GA'                  64.1
       LASTLY, TYPE 'GO' TO BEGIN THE SIMULATION.                         65.
