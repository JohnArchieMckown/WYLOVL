This folder (directory) contains three primary folders.
1.  BASMAC  -- The Stanford BASIC compiler macros.
2.  BASSRC  -- Source code for the BASIC compiler.
3.  GAMES.NUMBERED -- Sample BASIC programs.

GAMES.NUMBERED contains several BASIC programs, with line numbers
in columns 73/80.  These were saved this way because most systems
do NOT treat text files with imbedded line numbers, as was done in
Wylbur.  Since statements refer to line numbers, it was necessary
to preserve them in the data.  Some kind of translation of number
in statements (which match 73/80 numbers) to sequential line numbers
needs to be done.  We leave that as an exercise to the reader.

The other folders contain the BASIC compiler source (BASSRC) and
macros (BASMAC).  BASUTES is an old document describing the pieces.
Good Luck.
