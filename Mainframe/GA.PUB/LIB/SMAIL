SMAIL is a WYLBUR EXEC file that assists you in sending mail to accounts that
you specify, and optionally files the mail into  your  CHRON  file  for  later
reference.   Before  calling  on  SMAIL you must have collected the message in
your Active File.

To use it first collect in your active file the message to be sent.  Then give
the command SMAIL  and  a  return,  (CR).   SMAIL  will  prompt  you  for  the
recipient's account code, for the subject of the message, for a copy list, and
for  a  file  heading if you wish to file the message in your CHRON file.  You
must enter a recipient's code and the subject.  The copy list and file heading
are optional.  SMAIL also provides you with a local directory service in which
you may include the names and corresponding account codes of  frequently  used
recipients, and a distribution list facility.

The following briefly describes  the  prompts  and  possible  responses.   All
responses  may  be  in upper or lower case and must end with a carriage return
(CR).  If you "break out" of the program, to continue simply type CONT (CR).

To display this description  enter  SMAIL ? (CR)

: To:        (Purpose: To enter the recipients accounts)
To the prompt  : To:  you may reply with one of the following.
  (a)  Reply with a list of account codes and (CR).
       Example  :To:  HK.ABC GD.EES
  (b)  Reply with a distribution list name (5 or 6 characters), the
       first 4 of which must be the letters 'DIST' in upper or lower case.
       Example  : To:   Dist.A
       In this case SMAIL will search your personal directory for
       the Dist.A entry and if found will replace Dist.A with
       the list of accounts that comprise it.  If not there, it
       will allow you to enter the list for future reference.
  (c)  A combination of account codes and distribution lists.
       Example  : To:  GD.ESW Dist.A Dist12
  (d)  The name of the intended receiver followed by a "?".
       Example   : To:  Ed Shaw?
       SMAIL will search your directory and provide you with
       Ed Shaw's account if it is there.  If not there, it will allow
       you to enter it for future reference.
  (e)  The name of the distribution list followed by a "?".
       Example   : To:  Dist.B?
       SMAIL will search your directory and display the
       accounts that comprise Dist.B list.  If not there, it will
       allow you to enter the list for future reference.  This
       list is a dataset called MAILLIST.  You can edit it
       separately with WYLBUR.

: Subject:  (Purpose: To enter the subject of the message)
To the prompt  :Subject: you MUST enter a subject of up to approximately
       30 characters which is used in the mail header.
       Example  : Subject:  Notice of Staff Meeting on 11/22/80

: Send copies to:  (Purpose: To enter the list of accounts copied)
To the prompt  : Send copies to: you may give a carriage return if
       no copies are to be sent.  Otherwise you may give a list of
       account codes, distribution lists, or combinations of both.
       Refer to the : To:  description for more information.

: File under heading:  (Purpose: To cause the message to be filed)
To the prompt  : File under heading:  you may give a carriage return
       if you do not wish to file your mail.  Otherwise either give a
       heading (up to 12 characters) which will be used for later
       retrieval searching, or give a "*" which will use the message
       subject as the file heading.
       Example.  : File under heading:  1981 Budgets

SMAIL will then mail the message to the accounts desired after first adding to
the end of the message the To:  list and the cc:   list.   It  will  file  the
message if requested and leave your original message in your Active File.

Short Forms
SMAIL allows you to bypass some  or  all  of  the  prompts  by  including  the
necessary information in the call to SMAIL.  For example, 

    SMAIL to hk.deb gd.csb/Budget Increases for 1981/gd.mmr/Budgets

will send the message to accounts HK.DEB and GD.CSB.  It will use the title
"Budget Increases for 1981", will send a copy to GD.MMR, and will file it
under the heading Budgets in your CHRON file.

The order is important, with the fields separated by the "/".

     SMAIL to Accounts/ Subject / copied list / File heading.

You do not have to include all of the information when you enter SMAIL to  ...
You  may  stop  the  sequence  at  any  time.   SMAIL  will prompt you for the
remaining information.

     SMAIL to ax.gts/New Hire

will prompt you only for the copy list and the file header, whereas

      SMAIL to ax.gts/New Hire//

will do no further prompting since you have indicated no copy list and
no filing.

On any of the prompts, you may enter the remaining information (in  the  order
specified  above)  by using the "/" separators.  For example, you may reply to
the :  To:  prompt with
    :  To:  GD.EES GD.MMR/ TFM Meeting/Dist.B

If you wish to get a printed copy of  the  message,  give  the  command  PRINT
DOCUMENT after the message has been mailed.
