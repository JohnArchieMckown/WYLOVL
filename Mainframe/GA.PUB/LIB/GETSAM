; The GETSAM EXEC file is very simple.  It takes advantage of the
; TRANSPARENT option on the SAVE Command to put the SAMSON program
; image files onto the user's diskette.
;
; The EXEC file gives all of the appropriate warnings and interactions
; to try to prevent the user from doing something wrong.  If you are
; already familiar with what is going on (and you probably are if
; you are reading the EXEC File code), not that all the EXEC file
; does is execute four commands, namely:
;
;      use samexe.v2#xxsamson public  ;Get SAMSON.EXE program image for
;                                the appropriate micro (HP or IBM)
;      save c:samson.exe transparent ;Save on user's disk
;      use samexe.v2#xxterm public    ;Get SAMSON.TERM program image
;      save c:samson.term transparent ;Save on user's disk
;
;  This EXEC file works for either the IBM PC version of Samson or
;  the HP TouchScreen Version.  If you are using an IBM PC, you also
;  have the option of downloading the driver files and command files
;  for the Tektronix emulator program, provided in Samson Version 2.1.
