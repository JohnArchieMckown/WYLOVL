To use the LOOK command, first load your CHRON file into the  Active  File
with  the  USE  command.   Then  enter  "LOOK Subject" where Subject is the
character string which will be  searched.   The  first  character  must  be
alphabetic.   The  mail header lines will be searched for the occurrence of
the string, and the  corresponding  headers  will  be  displayed  with  the
associated  line  numbers.   Since there may be multiple results, enter the
line number for the desired message.

When your CHRON file has been split, with older mail saved in another file,
e.g.  CHR.SEP80, the header lines are retained in your CHRON file.  In this
case you may choose to load  the  saved  file  into  the  active  file  and
reexecute the LOOK command.
