Keyboard Information

The arrow keys move the cursor as indicated, and the HOME key moves the cursor
to and from the HOME location in Page mode (same as CTRL-A).

The numeric keypad layout is:
                                  +---------------------------+
                                  |  <=  |  =>  |  |<  |  >|  |
                                  |------+------+------+------|
                                  | Down |  Up  | Oops | Ins  |
                                  |------+------+------+------|
                                  | Prev | Next | DelL | DelW |
                                  |------+------+------+------|
                                  | Coll |Split | Join |      |
                                  |-------------+------| Home |
                                  |  Continue   | DelC |      |
                                  +---------------------------+
In addition, the function keys F0 through F9 on the top of the keyboard have
the same functions assigned to them as the numeric keys 0-9 on the keypad.
This allows you to use the numeric keypad for typing numbers without losing
the function keys.
