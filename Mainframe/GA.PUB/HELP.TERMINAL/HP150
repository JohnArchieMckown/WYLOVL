Keyboard Information

If you are using an HP150 with version 2 of Samson, then set your terminal
type to HP150PC.  Type HELP TERMINAL HP150PC for information.

Page WYLBUR uses already defined function keys on the HP150 keyboard.  If you
use Page WYLBUR frequently, you may want to relabel some of the keys.  Here
are the function keys with their corresponding key sequences in Page WYLBUR:

   KEY               SEQUENCE            FUNCTION

   Clear line        DEL E               Deletes to the end of the line
   Delete line       DEL L               Deletes entire line
   Insert line       ESC SPACE           Puts you in collect mode
   Insert Character  ESC I               Puts you in insert mode
   Clear Display     ESC V               Redisplays the screen
  *Select            ESC                 Works like the ESCAPE key in all
                                         sequences and should be used instead
                                         of ESCAPE
   Home              CTRL-A              Moves cursor to and from the
                                         command line (toggle)
   Delete char       DEL C               Deletes the character the
                                         cursor is on
   Insert char                           Turns on INSERT mode for one
                                         character
   Previous          ESC P               Displays previous page
   Next              ESC N               Displays next page
   shift ^           ESC U               Scrolls up four lines
   shift v           ESC D               Scrolls down four lines

 * Notice that on the HP150, the SELECT key should replace the ESCAPE key
   in ALL ESCAPE key sequences.  You may want to label this key edit to
   help you remember.

When you set up your terminal for use with Page WYLBUR you should specify
XON/XOFF for both the receive pacing (recvpace) and the transmit pacing
(xmitpace) fields on the port configuration screen.  Also make sure that you
have specified 7 data bits and even parity on the same screen.  Consult your
terminal manual for more information.
