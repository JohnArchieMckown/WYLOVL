.cm  JESDOWN  Added 08/10/81 by LSO, updated 10/28/82 by EAB
The error message "Unable to send JES2 command, path not active." is given
when a JES (Job Entry System) command (e.g.\LOCATE, HOLD, RELEASE) has been
issued and JES2 is currently unavailable.  Under normal circumstances, this
condition does not occur.  You can issue the SHOW JES command to check on the
status of JES2.
