.cm  LONGJOB  Added 03/28/81 by LSO, updated 08/24/82 by EAB
The error message "EXPANDED JOB CARD TOO LONG" is given when the job card
exceeds column 72, after being expanded by WYLBUR to include the job name and
account.  Split the job card at column 71, add a comma at or before column 71.
Then, insert a // at the beginning of the text that was split and moved to the
next line.
