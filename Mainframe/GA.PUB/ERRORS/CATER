The error message "Error #<n>.  Command incomplete." is given when an internal
error has occurred while processing a data set.  This condition is usually
accompanied by a system message explaining that there is a problem with the
volume.  If the problem persists, report it via the SUGGEST command with the
subject WYLBUR (e.g., SUGGEST WYLBUR).
