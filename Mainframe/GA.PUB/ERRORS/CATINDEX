.cm  CATINDEX  Added 03/22/81 by LSO, Updated 10/28/82 by EAB
The error message "Dsname is index." is given when a data set is already
cataloged that has the same dataset name, plus a data set name level that is
lower than that of the data set you tried to catalog.  For example, you tried
to catalog WYL.E1.ABC.BOOK when WYL.E1.ABC.BOOK.CHAP1 is already cataloged.
You can issue a SHOW CATALOG command (e.g., SHOW CATALOG FOR BOOK) to get an
index of catalog entries for the data set.
