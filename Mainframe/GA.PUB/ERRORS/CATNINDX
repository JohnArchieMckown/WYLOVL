The error message "Index does not exist." is given when you try to catalog a
data set with an indexed data set name that does not exist.

Under normal circumstances, this condition should not occur.  However, when
using IBM utility programs to create the higher indexes of a catalog entry, it
is possible to generate this error.  Refer to the IBM utility and catalog
management document for further information.
