The error message "CVOL not available." is given when the catalog control
volume for the volume you specified is not available.  (Each volume has its
catalog entries saved on a catalog control volume.) Under normal
circumstances, this condition should not occur.  If the problem persists,
report it via the SUGGEST command with the subject WYLBUR (e.g., SUGGEST
WYLBUR).
