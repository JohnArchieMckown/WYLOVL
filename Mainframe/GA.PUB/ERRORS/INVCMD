.cm   INVCMD  Added 03/29/81 by JDN/LSO, updated 08/19/82 by EAB
The error message "x: INVALID COMMAND" is given when "x" is not a recognized
system command.  This can happen when the command is not spelled correctly.
For a list of valid commands, type "HELP COMMANDS".  For a description of a
particular command, type "HELP command".

Note that when ORVYL is unavailable, certain valid ORVYL commands will also
produce this error message.  You can issue the SHOW SYSTEMS command to see if
ORVYL is available.
