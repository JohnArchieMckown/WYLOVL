The error message "<dsname> DSORG or RECFM not valid for WYLBUR." is given
when the data set you specified has an invalid data set organization or record
format.  This message is usually given when you attempt to save into a
sequential data set as if it were a library.  For example, SAVE BOOK#CHAP1
where BOOK is sequential.

The only data set organizations that are valid for WYLBUR usage are PS
(sequential) and PO (library).  The valid record formats for WYLBUR are U
(edit), F/FB (fixed), V/VB (variable).  Use the "SHOW DSNAMES LIKE dataset
ALL" command to display the data set organization and record format
information.
