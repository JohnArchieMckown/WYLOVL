The error message "<dataset> can't find space on <volume>" is given when the
system is unable to save the data set on the volume you specified because
there is insufficient space.  Use the "SHOW TRACKS ON volume" command to
display the actual number of tracks remaining on that volume.  You can find an
alternate volume by issuing the SHOW VOLUMES command.
