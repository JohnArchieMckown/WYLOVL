The error message "EXEC pointer not set." is given when an EXECUTE command is
executed in your EXEC file and the CURRENT line pointer for the EXEC file is
set to -1 (its default value).  This error can occur when you use the POINT
command in an EXEC file (usually for EXEC file labels).  For example, if the
command POINT 'string' EXECUTE is executed in an EXEC file and 'string' does
not exist CURRENT will be set to -1.

The command SHOW CURRENT EXECUTE displays the value of the CURRENT line
pointer in the EXEC file.  The command "EXECUTE line-number" (e.g., EXECUTE
FIRST) sets the CURRENT line pointer to line-number and resumes the execution
of the EXEC file at that line.
