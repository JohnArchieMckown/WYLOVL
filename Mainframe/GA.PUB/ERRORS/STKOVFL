The error message "Stack overflow.  Command aborted." is given when you issue
a command that requires more work area than is available.  This condition
should rarely occur.  If it continues to occur, collect a message in your
active file that includes the command you issued and sent it to ITS via a
SUGGEST command with the subject WYLBUR (i.e., SUGGEST WYLBUR).
