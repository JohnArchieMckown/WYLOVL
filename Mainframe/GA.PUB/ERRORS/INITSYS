The system is currently unavailable to the user community.  This usually means
that scheduled hardware and software maintenance is taking place.  If the
system is scheduled to be available and the "logon not allowed..." message is
given, please wait for the problem to be resolved (at which point the system
will automatically proceed with the logon prompts).  You can call 497-0431 for
system status information.
