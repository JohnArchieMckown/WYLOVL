The error message "<x>:  invalid characters in name." is given when you issue
a command like RUN or PRINT that includes a prefix or jobname option
containing invalid characters.  Only alphabetic, numeric, and national (@,$,#)
characters are allowed and, in some cases the first character must be an
alphabetic or national character.
