The error message "WYLBUR out of pages." is given when all of WYLBUR's external
pages are assigned.  This message should not occur under normal circumstances
(it means that a system parameter is too small).   When it does, wait a few
minutes (to allow time for other users to release pages assigned to them) and
re-issue the command.
