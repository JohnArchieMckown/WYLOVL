The error message "MEMBER SPECIFICATION INVALID" is given when you issue a
SHOW PROTECT command for a member of a Partitioned Data Set (i.e., library).
Data set protection is only available for the entire Partitioned Data Set or a
sequential data set.  Re-issue the command without the member specification.
