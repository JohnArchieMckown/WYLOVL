.cm  WRITERR  Added 03/28/81 by LSO, updated 09/30/82 by EAB
The error message "Data set write error.  Command aborted." is given when an
error occurs while writing a data set to disk (i.e., when you issue a SAVE
command).  Try reissuing the command.  If you still get the error message, try
saving the data set on a different volume.  To report the error to CIT,
collect text in your active file explaining the command (or commands) you
issued to get the error and send that explanation to ITS via a SUGGEST command
with the subject WYLBUR (i.e., SUGGEST WYLBUR).
