The error message "Multiple access privileges specified" is given when you
specify more than a single data set access level (e.g., SET PROTECT BOOK FOR
GROUP XA READ WRITE).  Re-issue the command with a single data set access
level (e.g., SET PROTECT BOOK FOR GROUP XA READ).  Type HELP SET PROTECT for
more information on data set access levels.
