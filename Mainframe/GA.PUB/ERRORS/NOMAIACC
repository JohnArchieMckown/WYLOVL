The error message 'Missing "TO account" on MAIL command.' is given when you
issue a MAIL command without a receiving account.  Re-issue the MAIL command
and include a "TO account" option, where "account" can be a single account or
a group of accounts enclosed in parentheses.  Type HELP MAIL TO for a complete
description of the TO option.
