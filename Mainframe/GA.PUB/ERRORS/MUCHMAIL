.cm  MUCHMAIL  Added 02/24/81 by LSO, Updated 08/24/82 by EAB
The error message "Mail not sent.  Too much mail, starting at line <n>." is
given when your active file contains too much mail.  Everything up to line 'n'
can be sent, so you can either specify a range option and send the mail in
several pieces, or you can delete the lines from line 'n' to last in order to
mail the complete active file.
