You must tell the system the brand of terminal you are using so that terminal
specific operations will work correctly.

Issue the command:

       SET TERMINAL name

to identify the terminal type.  If you are using Samson with a microcomputer
functioning as a terminal then you will be able to use the MICRO command after
you have identified the type of microcomputer you are using.

Here is a list of the microcomputer terminal types supported by Samson.

    Name         Brand of terminal
    ----         -----------------
    IBMPC        IBM Personal Computer with monochrome display.
    IBMPCC       IBM Personal Computer with color display.

Type "HELP TERMINAL TYPES" for a complete list of supported terminal types.
