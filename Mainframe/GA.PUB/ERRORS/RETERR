.cm  RETERR  Added on 10/28/82 by LSO
The error message "No EXEC file, can't set RETURN." is given when you specify
both the CLEAR and the RETURN options on an EXEC command.  Usually, this
message is given when you attempt to use command retry on an EXEC command with
the CLEAR and RETURN options.  The RETURN option can not be processed because
the EXEC file has already been cleared.
