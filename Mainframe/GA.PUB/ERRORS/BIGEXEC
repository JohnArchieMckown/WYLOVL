.cm  BIGEXEC  Added 01/01/78 by JDN, updated 08/16/82 by EAB
The error message "FILE TOO BIG -- NO EXEC" is given when the file is too
large to fit in the EXEC file space.  The EXEC file space can currently
contain about 500-600 lines (depending on how long the lines are).  Since the
command was interrupted when the EXEC file space was full, the command "LIST
LAST EXEC" will show you the last line that fit in the EXEC file.
