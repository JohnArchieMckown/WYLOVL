The error message "<volser>: volume-owner permits not enabled" is given when
you issue a SET PROTECT command that includes OWNER and VOLUME options and the
volume owner data set SYS1.ACSVOP is missing from the specified volume.  Send
a SUGGEST with subject WYLBUR (i.e., SUGGEST WYLBUR) asking that a volume
owner data set be added to that volume.
