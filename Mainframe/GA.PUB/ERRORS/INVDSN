The error message "<dsname>: invalid dsname." or "<dsname>: invalid characters
in dsname." is given when the data set name you specified does not conform to
the standard OS data set naming conventions.  Non-standard dsnames can be used
if the name is enclosed in quotes.  The case of the text inside the quotes IS
significant (e.g., "4CLASS" is NOT the same as "4class").  The use of
non-standard dsnames is not recommended since these data sets are more
difficult to access from the batch (OS) system.  Type HELP DSNAME for a
description of the OS data set naming conventions.
