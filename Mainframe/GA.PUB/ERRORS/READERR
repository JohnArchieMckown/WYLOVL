.cm  READERR  Added 03/28/81 by LSO, updated 09/30/82 by EAB
The error message "Data set read error.  Proceeding." is given when an error
occurs while reading a data set (i.e., when you issue a USE, COPY FROM, or
PRINT FROM command).  Try issuing the command again.  If the error message is
repeated, collect text in your active file explaining what command (or
commands) caused this error and send that explanation to ITS via a SUGGEST
command with the subject WYLBUR (i.e., SUGGEST WYLBUR).
