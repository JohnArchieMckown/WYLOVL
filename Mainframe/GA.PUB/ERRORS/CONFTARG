The error message "Multiple permit targets specified" is given when you
specify more than one account for a data set protection (e.g., SET PROTECT
BOOK FOR GROUP XA XB READ).  Re-issue the command with a single account
specification (e.g., SET PROTECT BOOK FOR GROUP XA READ).  Type HELP SET
PROTECT for more information about how to specify data set protection.
