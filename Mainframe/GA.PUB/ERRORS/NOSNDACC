The error message "Missing account(s) for SEND." is given when you issue the
SEND command without a receiving account.  Re-issue the SEND command and
include an account option where "account" can be a single account or a group
of accounts enclosed in parentheses.  Type HELP SEND OPTION ACCOUNT for a
complete description of the account option.
