The error message "ACTIVE file is too big." is given when the command has
stopped because the active file contains too many characters.  The active file
can contain approximately 1000 pages of text (assuming the lines are about 70
characters long and 60 lines per page).  The exact active file limit is 2.7
million characters (so long lines will take up more space than short ones).
