CONCATENATE enables or  cancels the formation of  output lines by
concatenating  input lines  and truncating  at  the nearest  word
boundary to fit on the output line.

<.B+>ON:  <.B->Output lines will be created  by adding words from the input<.NORMAL>
   lines until a word  is found which will not fit  on the output
   line.   The resulting output line  will therefore have as many
   words as  possible without exceeding the  line-length restric-
   tion  (or column-length  restriction,   if in  multiple-column
   mode).
<.B+>OFF:  <.B->Suppresses  the concatenation action,   which results  in a<.NORMAL>
   "one line in,  one line out" effect that may exceed the length
   of the  output line,   depending on the  lengths of  the input
   lines.   If justification (.JU) is still enabled, extra blanks
   will then  be added between  words to  extend the line  to the
   right margin.

This control word causes a break.   An omitted operand is treated
as  "ON".    Concatenation  is  "ON"   at  the  start  of  SCRIPT
processing,  and can only be suppressed by the .CO or .FO control
words with an "OFF" operand.  Multiple blanks that occur together
within an  input line  will all be  retained in  the concatenated
output line unless  the concatenation process "breaks"  the input
line at that point when adding words to the output line.
