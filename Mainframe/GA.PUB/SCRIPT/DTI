TRANSLATE ON INPUT allows the user to specify an escape character
and a translate table to be used on input lines.

This control word does not cause a break.

<.B+>SET <char>:  <.B->In all subsequent input text and control lines,  the<.NORMAL>
   character immediately  following the  escape character  "char"
   will  be  translated  according to  the  .TI  translate  table
   currently in effect, and the escape character removed.  If .TI
   is used without any operands, the translate table specified by
   the TRANSLATE  option when SCRIPT  was invoked will  be reins-
   tated  and any  previously-defined  escape  character will  be
   nullified.   If SET is specified without a "char" operand, the
   current escape character  will be nullified but  the translate
   table  will remain.    When there  is no  escape character  in
   effect, no input translations are performed.
<.B+><s1 t1> <s2 t2> ...:  <.B->specifies  "source" characters to be trans-<.NORMAL>
   lated to "target" characters.
<.B+>s <<.U+>s<.U->|t>:   <.B->This form of the  control word allows a  single source<.NORMAL>
   character to  be translated into  itself if no  "target" char-
   acter is specified.

Many  of  the commoner  uses  of  .TI  can be  more  conveniently
achieved through the  use of the &x' function.    The .TI control
word is occasionally of use when output must have a character set
larger than the input character set.  For example, a 029 keypunch
lacks the lowercase  alphabetics but using .TI  and .TR translate
tables "$A" could print as uppercase  and "A" as lower.   See the
TRANSLATE ".TR" control  word for more information  on specifying
the input translate table.
