<.B+><MAC|SUB|GML|ALL> <<.U+>ON<.U->|OFF>:   <.B->MAC displays  each line  of control<.NORMAL>
   words and text  as it is executed from a  Macro.   These lines
   are flagged  with '*M*'.   SUB  displays each line  of control
   words and  text if it contains  a set symbol that  is changing
   the original input.  The original line is marked with the file
   name and record  number and all substitutions in  the line are
   flagged with '*S*'.   A set symbol  that begins with a control
   word separator  will be  flagged with '*T*'  to show  that the
   input is being truncated and a logical new line started.   GML
   displays the  transformation of a Generalized  Markup Language
   tag into a macro.   These lines are flagged with '*G*'.   Each
   may be turned ON or OFF  separately.   ALL combines the effect
   of MAC, SUB and GML.
<.B+><ON|OFF>:  <.B->ON combines  the effect of MAC and  SUB.   OFF cancels<.NORMAL>
   the effect of MAC, SUB, and GML.
<.B+><SNAP>:  <.B->displays the name and value of all Set Symbols currently<.NORMAL>
   defined.   Local Symbols and their  values are displayed after
   the name of the file in which they are defined.   The names of
   all System Set Symbols and their values are displayed last.  A
   character value of a Symbol is displayed within single quotes.
   A subscripted  Symbol is  displayed as  a subscript  in paren-
   theses following the unsubscripted  Symbol name.   The Symbols
   are not displayed in any predictable order.

This control  word does not cause  a break.   If no  operands are
specified, no action is performed.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .IT SUB
    .se i = 0
    .se i = &i + 1
    .se *roman = &r'&i
    .IT OFF
    This example will display a trace  of the substitution of all
    Symbols.
(2) .IT SNAP
    This will show all Global,  Local  and System Set Symbols and
    their values.
