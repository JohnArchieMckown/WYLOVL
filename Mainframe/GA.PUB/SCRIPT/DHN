HEADNOTE formats a block of text that  will be printed at the top
of the text area on all subsequent pages.

If neither EVEN  nor ODD is specified,  the  operation applies to
headnotes for both even- and odd-numbered pages.

<.B+><EVEN|ODD> <BEGIN|END>:  <.B->BEGIN  and END define the  start and end<.NORMAL>
   of the headnote.  The formatting environment is saved by BEGIN
   and restored by END.   The headnote block will be formatted to
   occupy the entire line length,   NOT the column length;  head-
   notes  are always  in single-column  mode.   (Any  outstanding
   Conditional or  Floating text  blocks will  print following  a
   headnote,  and in the single- or multiple-column mode in which
   they were created.)
<.B+><EVEN|ODD> DELETE:  <.B->Deletes the specified headnote.<.NORMAL>
<.B+><EVEN|ODD> DUMP:  <.B->Forces the immediate  printing of the specified<.NORMAL>
   headnote, whether currently at the top of a page or not.

This control word does not cause a break.   No operand is assumed
by default.

    This  example defines  a headnote  consisting  of a  boxed-in
    title that will print at the tops of all subsequent even- and
    odd-numbered pages until re-defined or deleted,  or until the
    end of SCRIPT processing.
