SET LEADING is supported only  in conjunction with output devices
which can  place text  anywhere on the  page.   It  specifies the
vertical  spacing,  from  baseline to  baseline,  for  subsequent
output.

This control word causes a break.   An operand must be specified;
"v" must be  a positive numeric value representing  the number of
"device units" for the vertical leading.  If specified as "+v" or
"-v",  the value  will added algebraically to  the current value;
the result must  be positive.   The vertical  leading operand may
also be specified  in absolute units,  such as  inches or points.
Any  such operand  will be  converted  to an  integral number  of
device units.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) This  control word  will  immediately  send the  new  leading
    information  to the  output  file.   If  the  document is  in
    multiple columns or within a text block such as a footnote at
    the time  then the change  of leading  will not occur  at the
    desired place.   The  leading information is repeated  at the
    top of  each output  "page" so that  information will  not be
    lost when using the FROM/TO options.   This temporary measure
    is merely  a means to  transmit leading information  from the
    input document to the typesetter post-processor program.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .sl 10
    defines the  output leading  to be  10 points  if the  output
    device is PHOTO; 10/300ths of an inch for IP300, QMSlaser and
    X2700; and 10/240ths of an inch for IMP10 and I3820.
(2) .sl p12
    defines the output leading to be 0 picas and 12 points.  This
    is the  same as  12/72 or  1/6th of  an inch  for any  output
    device.
