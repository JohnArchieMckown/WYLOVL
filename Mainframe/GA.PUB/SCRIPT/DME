This control word does not cause  a break.   If an operand "line"
has been specified, it will be processed as an input line immedi-
ately on return  to the higher-level file or macro.    If the .ME
control word is used in  the highest-level file,  SCRIPT advances
to the top of the next page  and prints any stacked output before
termination of all processing.
