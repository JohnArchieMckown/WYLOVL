LINE LENGTH defines the horizontal size  of the output line to be
used in "formatted" mode.

This control word  causes a break.   If used  without an operand,
the value  is taken from the  value of the LLength  SCRIPT option
(60, if none was specified).  An operand of the form "+h" or "-h"
adds this value algebraically to the current line length, so long
as the resulting value is 2 or greater and not more than 240.  If
the text  area is subsequently  divided into multiple  columns by
using the SET operand of the  .CD control word,  the total length
of  the  multiple-column  output   lines  plus  the  inter-column
"gutters" will add up to the .LL value.

   Almost all line printers and  many fixed-pitch terminals print
at 10 characters per horizontal  inch.   For such output devices,
the  default  value  of  60 used  in  combination  with  ".AD 10"
produces a 1.5-inch left margin and a 1-inch right margin.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .ll 65
    This sets the line length to 65 characters.
(2) .ll 6.5i
    This sets the  line length to six and one  half inches.   The
    number of characters would depend  on the value specified for
    the Characters Per Inch (CPI) option when SCRIPT was invoked.
