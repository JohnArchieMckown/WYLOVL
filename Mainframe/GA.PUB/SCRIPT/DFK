FLOATING KEEP  enables the user  to create  a block of  text that
will print together, either immediately or at the top of the next
column (or page, if in single-column mode).

<.B+><BEGIN|END <<.U+>0<.U->|m>>:   <.B->These operands are  equivalent to  those for<.NORMAL>
   the .CC  control word,  with the  exception that if  the block
   will not  fit in the  current column,   then it is  queued for
   output into the text area at the  top of the next column,  and
   the remainder of the current column  is filled with the output
   produced by  the text  and control words  that come  after the
   ".FK END".   Blocks created by .FK  may therefore be "floated"
   to a position later than where they were defined in the input.
<.B+>DUMP <n>:  <.B->forces the immediate output  of all (or the first "n")<.NORMAL>
   Floating Keep  blocks that  have not  yet been  output.   Each
   outstanding block of text will print at the top of a column if
   there is insufficient room left in the current column.

This control word causes a break.  An operand must be provided as
none will be assumed.  The default length adjustment for "END" is
zero.   See  the description  under .CC for  the list  of control
words that  may not  be used  within the  BEGIN/END range.    The
&SYSFKC System  Set Symbol  can be examined  after the  ".FK END"
control word to determine the count of lines in all Floating Keep
blocks currently waiting to be output.
