LEADING BLANK is generated internally by  SCRIPT to cause a break
for each input line that starts with one or more blanks.

An  input text  line that  begins with  one or  more blanks  will
normally cause a  break in the output,  and the  next output line
will start with the leading blank(s).  The break is actually done
by the ".LB"  control word that is generated  and executed before
the line containing the leading  blank is processed.   The gener-
ated ".LB" control word has the  same function as the Break (.BR)
control word.

   To alter  the function of  this generated ".LB"  control word,
you may use .DM to define a  macro named "LB".   This macro might
be defined to do nothing,  or it  might create a new paragraph by
issuing a .SK  control word,  or whatever else  is appropriate to
your needs.   If a "LB" macro is defined, the original input line
will be processed immediately afterwards.  The leading blank will
still be present but this will  not cause a break.   The original
text line with a leading blank  could be processed differently by
using ".RV symbol FILE" and  manipulating the original text  in a
Set Symbol.

   This control word causes a  break.   When generated internally
by SCRIPT, it has no operand line.  It is not generated to create
a break when ".LI ON" is in effect.

    This is the first paragraph of formatted text.
    It does not start with any leading blanks.
         This is the second paragraph of formatted text.
    It starts with five leading blanks
    and creates a blank line.

    This example produces the following output:

    This is the first paragraph of  formatted text.   It does not
    start with any leading blanks.

         This is  the second  paragraph of  formatted text.    It
    starts with five leading blanks and creates a blank line.
