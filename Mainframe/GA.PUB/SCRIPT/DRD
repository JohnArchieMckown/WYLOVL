READ  TERMINAL reads  input  lines  from the  terminal,   thereby
enabling the  user to  type lines into  the output  during SCRIPT
processing.

This control word causes a break.  If the operand is omitted then
1 is  assumed.   When the .RD  control word is  encountered,  "n"
lines are  read from the terminal  but are not  processed,  other
than that they do  add to the count of lines  on the output page.
Pressing the ATTENTION or BREAK key  terminates the .RD.   It can
also be  terminated by typing a  "null" line,  but the  null line
will count as one line on the output page.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) This control  word may  be useful  to allow  addresses to  be
    inserted in form  letters or to allow the user  to change the
    typing element.
(2) If output is not to the terminal,  SCRIPT will insert <.U+>n<.U-> <.U->blank<.NORMAL>
    lines in the output.
(3) If output is  not to the terminal <.U+>and<.U-> <.U->the  .RD is encountered<.NORMAL>

    effect, spaces will not appear at the top of the next column.
    If however,   output is  to the  terminal and  the other  two
    conditions are met, spaces <.U+>will<.U-> <.U->appear at the top of the next<.NORMAL>
    column.
