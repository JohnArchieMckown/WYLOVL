SAVE ENVIRONMENT saves  the current formatting environment  to be
restored later with a Restore Environment.

In order to design a modular SCRIPT input file,  it may be neces-
sary  to  alter one  or  more  formatting characteristics  for  a
section or chapter.  For example, a new absolute INDENT value may
be desired without  knowing the value of the  existing INDENT and
that value must be restored before returning control.

<.B+>envname:  <.B->The operand specifies a name  for the environment to be<.NORMAL>
   saved.  The saved environment may be restored later by Restore
   Environment with a matching  "envname" operand.   Environments
   that are saved with a name may  be restored more than once and
   may be saved again by specifing the same name.   The "envname"
   may be up to sixteen characters in length and it is treated as
   if entered in uppercase.

      If the "envname" operand is  not specified,  the Save Envi-
   ronment control word will save the current formatting environ-
   ment in a push-down stack of up to ten levels, to be popped up
   later with a  Restore Environment also used  with no "envname"
   operand.    Note that  Save Environment  does  not change  any
   current values.

This control  word does not cause  a break.   Any  pending Indent
Line (.IL), Offset (.OF) or Undent (.UN) will be saved.   If this
is not desired, you must issue your own Break (.BR) before saving
the current status.

   The operands  currently in  effect for  the following  control
words are saved/restored:
