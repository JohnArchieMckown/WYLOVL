This control  word does  not cause  a break.    The current  font
status is  saved in a  push down stack that  may be up  to twenty
levels deep.

   If no font name is specified  as an operand,  the current font
status is stacked and remains in effect.  More than one font name
may be specified:    the first that matches a  Defined Font (.DF)
name will be used.   A single equal sign '=' at the end of such a
list will stack the current font status in effect.

   A  font  name that  has  been  begun  is terminated  with  the
Previous Font (.PF) control word.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) The System  Set Symbol &SYSBFONTS  contains the names  of the
    stacked font names in effect.  These names are separated by a
    blank with the most recent first.
(2) This control word is treated as  a comment for output devices
    that do not support fonts.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .bf head text
    This would stack a defined font name with the name of 'head'.
    If 'head'  does not exist,   then one  with a name  of 'text'
    would be stacked.  An error will occur if neither is defined.
(2) .bf head text =
    Now if neither 'head' or 'text'  is a defined fontid,  a copy
    of the current font definition will be stacked.
(3) .bf
    With no  operand a  copy of  the current  font definition  is
    stacked.
