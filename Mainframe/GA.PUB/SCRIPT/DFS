This control word causes a break.   Up to thirty-two footings may
be defined and printed at the bottom of each page.  An operand of
the  form "+n"  or  "-n" adds  this  value  algebraically to  the
current Footing  Space,  so  long as the  resulting value  is not
negative.   See the .BM description  for the relationship between
.FS, .FM, and .BM.
