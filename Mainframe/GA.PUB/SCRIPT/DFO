This control word creates a break.   The "OFF" operand is equiva-
lent to the  control words CONCATENATE OFF and  JUSTIFY OFF.   An
omitted  operand is  treated  as "ON",   which  is equivalent  to
CONCATENATE  ON and  JUSTIFY ON.    The  other possible  operands
specify CONCATENATE ON and the appropriate mode of JUSTIFY.   See
the .CO and .JU descriptions for details.
