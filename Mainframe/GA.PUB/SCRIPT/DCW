CONTROL WORD  SEPARATOR defines the  character that SCRIPT  is to
recognize as a "logical line end"  so that multiple control words
may be entered on one physical input line.

This  control  word does  not  cause  a break.    All  subsequent
control-word input lines are examined  for the control word sepa-
rator.    If found  then  the physical  input  line is  logically
divided into two input lines,  the  second of which starts at the
first column  after the  separator.   The  control-word-separator
scanning  rule is  then applied  to this  resulting second  input
line.   The initial  default control word separator  character is
the semi-colon (;).  Any character or two-digit hexadecimal value
may be specified.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) The last "logical" input line may be a text line.
(2) If substitution (.SU) of Set Symbols is ON and the input line
    is a control-word line,  the substitution scan will terminate
    at the first  control word separator.   The  remainder of the
    line will be  substituted when it in turn it  is processed as
    an input line.
(3) Scanning for the  control word separator may  be suspended on
    an input control line if a  single quote (',  the apostrophe)
    immediately follows the control-word indicator.   This allows
    the control-word separator  to be used as  operand text.   It
    also allows an  entire input line to be  substituted with set
    symbols.
(4) If the operand is omitted,  the existence of and scanning for
    a control-word separator is terminated.   Therefore, multiple
    control  words will  not be  recognized  on subsequent  input
    lines, nor may a control word be followed by text on the same
    input line.
(5) Disabling the separator character is the same as ".CW 00".

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .'bd This is text; it contains a semi-colon.
    produces:  <.B+>This is text; it contains a semi-colon.<.NORMAL>
    The control word modifier (') suspends control-word-separator
    scanning and  allows semi-colons to  be entered in  the oper-
    ands.   The same input line without the control word modifier
    would produce:  <.B+>This is text<.NORMAL>
     it contains a semi-colon.
(2) .sr i = &i + 1;The value of I is "&i".
    The value of "i" is incremented by one and the result is used

    in the text input line that follows.
(3) .sk;.of 4;(a) This is text in a list.
(4) .cw #;.rt top /left;/center;/right;/#.cw ;#.sk;.cm
    This example makes the separator  "#",  defines a TOP running
    title containing semi-colons,  redefines  the separator to be
    ";", and then uses it.
