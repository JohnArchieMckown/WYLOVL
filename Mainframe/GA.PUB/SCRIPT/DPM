PAGE MARGIN positions the left margin  of the formatted text with
respect to the physical left margin of the output device.

<.B+><<.U+>0<.U->|h1|+h1|-h1>:  <.B->A  value of  the form  "h1" positions  the first<.NORMAL>
   character of the  output line "h1" spaces to the  right of the
   first possible print position of  the output device.   A value
   of  the form  "+h1"" adds  "h1""  spaces to  the current  page
   margin value and a value of the form "-h1" subtracts it.
<.B+><<.U+>0<.U->|h2|+h2|-h2>:  <.B->If  a second operand  is specified,  it  will be<.NORMAL>
   taken as  the Page Margin  for all even-numbered  pages.   The
   first operand will apply to all subsequent odd-numbered pages.
   If the  second operand is omitted,   the even margin  is taken
   from the first operand.

This control word causes a break.   The page margin values remain
in  effect  for all  subsequent  output  lines until  altered  by
another ".PM" control word.  If .PM is specified with no operands
at all,  the page margin value  is assumed from the initial value
of the ADJUST option, normally zero.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) Specifying Page  Margin values  is something  that should  be
    done only at the start of the input file; in most cases, they
    should  not be altered thereafter.
(2) The Page Margin (.PM)  and ADjust (.AD)  control words affect
    the same internal values.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .pm 1.5i
    sets a left page margin value of one and one-half inches.
(2) .pm 1.0i .5i
    sets a  page margin of one  inch on odd-numbered pages  and a
    page margin of one-half inch on even-numbered pages.
