<.B+><.U+>The Levels of Hyphenation<.NORMAL>

<.B+>OFF:   <.B->No hyphenation  at all  will  be performed  and that  only<.NORMAL>
   blanks between words  are to be considered for  the purpose of
   concatenating text.
<.B+>USER:  <.B->This is one level higher in that words containing hyphens,<.NORMAL>
   such  as "brother-in-law",   may be  broken after  a "-"  when
   concatenating text.  It also causes a hyphen at the end of any
   input line to be treated as a conditional hyphen.   The condi-
   tional hyphen  will be  discarded if there  is space  for more
   text on the current output line  and will remain as entered if
   the line can hold no more.
<.B+>ON:  <.B->Enables the automatic hyphenation of words that are too long<.NORMAL>
   to fit on the output line.х

<.B+><.U+>SETting Limits for Automatic Hyphenation<.NORMAL>

For all of the Hyphenation "SET" operands,  a value of zero means
"the largest possible value".

<.B+>SET THRESH <<.U+>5<.U->|n|+n|-n>:  <.B->Defines  the hyphenation threshold.   At<.NORMAL>
   least this number of  spaces must remain at the end  of a line
   to be  formatted before hyphenation  will be  attempted.   The
   value must be positive and has an initial and default value of

х The algorithmic  hyphenation rules  employed have  been adapted
  and  extended from  a program  package called  HYPHENATION/360.
  See the IBM Application Description Manual, form E20-0257,  for
  a clear description (in ten pages) of the algorithms employed.

   5.
<.B+>SET MINPT <<.U+>3<.U->|n|+n|-n>:  <.B->Defines the  minimum number of characters<.NORMAL>
   that must appear before the  hyphen.   The initial and default
   value of 3 means  at least three characters at the  start of a
   word will be kept together.
<.B+>SET ENDPT <<.U+>3<.U->|n|+n|-n>:  <.B->Defines the  minimum number of characters<.NORMAL>
   that must be left after the  hyphen.   The initial and default
   value of  3 means at  least three characters  at the end  of a
   word will be kept together.
<.B+>SET SUP <<.U+>3<.U->|n|+n|-n>:   <.B->Defines the maximum number  of consecutive<.NORMAL>
   output lines that will  be eligible for automatic hyphenation.
   After "n" consecutive hyphenated lines  on the same page,  the
   next output line will not be hyphenated.
<.B+>SET UPPER ALL:  <.B->All words containing  letters and the user delim-<.NORMAL>
   iters '-' and  '/' are eligible for hyphenation,   even if the
   word is all uppercase.
<.B+>SET UPPER ON:  <.B->Words in which  all the letters are uppercase will<.NORMAL>
   not be  eligible for  hyphenation.   This  is the  initial and
   default value;  proper names and the  first word of a sentence
   may be  hyphenated,  but  special terms  such as  "FORTRAN" or
   "SYSPUB" will never be hyphenated.
<.B+>SET UPPER  OFF:  <.B->Only words  that contain only  lowercase letters<.NORMAL>
   are eligible for hyphenation.
<.B+>SET  USER ON:   <.B->Compound words  are eligible  for hyphenation  at<.NORMAL>
   points other than the compound break point (at a "-" or "/" in
   the word).   The compound break point would only be used if it
   were the best break for the  current length of line.   This is
   the initial and default value for "SET USER".
<.B+>SET USER OFF:  <.B->When a compound word is being examined for hyphen-<.NORMAL>
   ation points,  only the compound break  points in the word may
   be used.   Therefore,  a word such as "extra-special" may only
   be broken at the "-".

<.B+><.U+>Suppressing Hyphenation Temporarily<.NORMAL>

<.B+>SUP:  <.B->Suppresses automatic  hyphenation to the "OFF"  level until<.NORMAL>
   the next  break occurs.   This  is useful to  effectively turn
   hyphenation off until the end of  a paragraph,  at which point
   the current setting is restored.

<.B+><.U+>The Hyphenation Exception Dictionary<.NORMAL>

SCRIPT uses both algorithmic  and exception-dictionary techniques
to hyphenate words.  The exception-dictionary technique is essen-
tial, since the algorithms do not work successfully for all words
in the  language.и The "user"  exception dictionary  is something
_____________________

и SCRIPT  is distributed  with  a  built-in dictionary  of  known
  "exception" words,   and it is possible  to add to  or override
  this internal dictionary via a "user" dictionary.  The built-in
  exception dictionary has been created  from a "user" dictionary
  via ".IM SYSHYPH".  Beware -- each exception word in the "user"
  dictionary  requires sixteen  bytes,   so  the 3000+  words  in

that must be  constructed during SCRIPT processing  via the oper-
ands discussed below.

<.B+>ADD:  <.B->Inserts a word into the "user" exception dictionary.аю This<.NORMAL>
   is sometimes  necessary to distinguish  between words  such as
   the noun "pres-ent"  and the verb "pre-sent".   A  word may be
   specified without break points, such as "Waterloo", to prevent
   it from being broken across output  lines.   A word already in
   the dictionary  may be added  again,  as these  duplicates are
   entered in a "last in, first out" order.
<.B+>CHANGE:  <.B->Operates  as "ADD" if  the alphabetic characters  of the<.NORMAL>
   word operand do not match any  current entry.   If the charac-
   ters do match  an entry,  that entry is replaced  with its new
   break points.
<.B+>DELETE:  <.B->To  "DELETE" a word,   the letters  of the word  and its<.NORMAL>
   break points must  match.   (Words cannot be  DELETEd from the
   built-in internal dictionary.)
<.B+>TEST:  <.B->To find  all the hyphen break  points of a word,   use the<.NORMAL>
   "TEST" operand.  SCRIPT will display the input word and all of
   its break points at the terminal.
<.B+>PURGE:   <.B->Deletes  all   the  entries  in  the   "user"  exception<.NORMAL>
   dictionary.
<.B+>DUMP:   <.B->Displays  all  words  in  the  current  "user"  exception<.NORMAL>
   dictionary at the terminal.   Note that  the words do not list
   alphabetically but in order by  frequency of letter occurrence
   in English.

This control word does not cause  a break.   There are no default
operands.  The initial setting of the hyphenation level is "USER"
with no entries in the "user" exception word dictionary.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .HY ADD scripture
    Never hyphenate any occurrence of the word "scripture".
(2) .HY ADD pres-ent
    A happy birthday present.
(3) .HY CHANGE pre-sent
    The University of Waterloo has presented ...
(4) .HY off;.* I'd rather do it myself.

  SYSHYPH would require over 44K of main storage.

аю When running with  multiple passes,  you should  construct any
   large "user" exception dictionary only  on the first pass,  as
   the exception dictionary is not cleared between passes.
