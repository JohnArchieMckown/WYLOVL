"Option" specifies which  special character or characters  are to
be defined.  Any operands that follow specify the values of those
characters.   All character  operands may be entered  as a single
character or as  a pair of hexadecimal digits.   In  all cases an
"OFF" operand disables  the feature and a  missing operand reins-
tates the default  value.   The default and "OFF"  values for the
characters  are specified  under the  various character  options.
The character options that may be specified are:

<.B+>BS  (backspace):   <.B->defines a character to  be treated as  a back-<.NORMAL>
   space character in input text and control words.   The initial
   default value and  the "OFF" value is hex 16,   the real back-
   space character,   which is always  recognized as  a backspace
   character even  when .DC BS has  been used to  define another.
   The &SYSBS  Set Symbol  returns the  current user-defined  tab
   character, or hex 16 if none has been defined.
<.B+>CONT  (continue):   <.B->defines a character  for continuing  an input<.NORMAL>
   line without an intervening blank.  If an input text line ends
   with the continue character,  the following input text line is
   placed immediately following.    A control word that  causes a
   break will  clear an  outstanding continue  character and  the
   character will  not appear  in the  output.   The  initial and
   "OFF" value for continue is a blank (hex 40).   The Set Symbol
   &SYSCONT returns the current continue character.
<.B+>CW  (control word  separator):  <.B->defines a character  for entering<.NORMAL>
   multiple control words on one  input line.   Text lines (lines
   that do  not begin with a  control word indicator)   are never
   affected by this  character.   The initial control  word sepa-
   rator character  is a  semicolon (;).   The  "OFF" value  is a
   hex 00.   The  Set Symbol &SYSCW  returns the  current control
   word separator character.
<.B+>GML  (Generalized Markup Language  tag indicator):  <.B->the character<.NORMAL>
   that precedes a GML Tag.   The initial and "OFF" value for GML
   is a blank (hex 40).  The default character, if none is speci-
   fied,  is  a colon (:).   The  &SYSGML Set Symbol  returns the
   current GML character.
<.B+>HYPH   (hyphenation  character):   <.B->defines the  character  to  be<.NORMAL>
   placed at the end of words hyphenated by SCRIPT.   The default
   and initial Hyphenation Character is a minus (-, hex 60).  The
   "OFF" value is a blank.

<.B+>LI  (control word indicator):  <.B->defines the character that identi-<.NORMAL>
   fies special control records when it occurs at the start of an
   input line.    If the character occurs  once then it may  be a
   macro invocation or a native  control word.   If the character
   occurs twice in a row then it may only be a control word indi-
   cator.   The initial  control word indicator is  a period (.).
   The "OFF" value is a blank.  The &SYSLI Set Symbol returns the
   current control word indicator.
<.B+>LINB  (Nobreak  control word  indicator):  <.B->defines  the character<.NORMAL>
   that identifies an input line as a control word but suppresses
   the break action of that control word.   The initial and "OFF"
   value is a blank.  The &SYSLINB Set Symbol returns the current
   nobreak control word indicator.
<.B+>MCS  (GML  Markup/Content Separator):  <.B->the character  that termi-<.NORMAL>
   nates a GML Tag and its  attributes.   The initial and default
   character, if none is specified,  is a period (.).   The "OFF"
   value for  MCS is a blank  (hex 40).   The &SYSMCS  Set Symbol
   returns the current MCS character.
<.B+>PIX   (Primary IndeX  reference  entry  indicator):  <.B->defines  the<.NORMAL>
   character that, when used as the first or only character in an
   "alternate reference entry" with the .IX control word,  causes
   that index  entry to appear  at the  beginning of the  list of
   reference entries.   This character does  not get added to the
   reference entry.   The default and initial primary index char-
   acter is an asterisk (*).   The  "OFF" value is a blank.   The
   &SYSPIX Set  Symbol returns  the current  primary index  char-
   acter.
<.B+>PS  (Page Symbol):  <.B->defines the character  that is to be replaced<.NORMAL>
   by the  current page number in  title control words.    It may
   also  be used  in Set  Symbol assignments.    The default  and
   initial page symbol character is  the percent (%).   The "OFF"
   value is a blank.   The &SYSPS  Set Symbol returns the current
   page symbol character.
<.B+>PUNC   (Spell Punctuation):   <.B->define characters  that  are to  be<.NORMAL>
   considered as part of a word if  they occur in the middle of a
   word,  but are to  be ignored if they occur at  the end.   The
   initial default PUNC character is  the single quote.   See .DC
   WORD also.
<.B+>RB  (Required Blank):  <.B->defines a character  that is to be treated<.NORMAL>
   as a  required blank (will appear  as a blank on  output,  but
   will not be recognized as an interword blank).  This is useful
   for  keeping text  together  on one  line.    The initial  and
   default value for a required blank is hex 00.  The "OFF" value
   is  a  blank.   The  &SYSRB  Set  Symbol returns  the  current
   required blank character.
<.B+>STOP  (full-stop  punctuation):  <.B->defines the characters  that are<.NORMAL>
   recognized as  "full stops" when they  occur at the end  of an
   input text line.   Two intervening blanks will be placed after
   such characters, before the next word on the output line.  The
   initial and  default list  of stop  characters are  the period
   (.), question (?), exclamation (!) and colon (:).  When SCRIPT
   is invoked with the PHOTO option, "OFF" is default.

<.B+>SUB (SUBscript characters):   <.B->defines the characters that  are to<.NORMAL>
   be used for the Subscript Function (&s').   Character operands
   are specified in pairs,  with  the first specifying the normal
   input character and the second specifying the output character
   to  be generated  when  the input  character  is  used in  the
   operand of the  Subscript Function.   The initial  and default
   Subscript characters  are defined in  the ALA  print character
   assignments.   See  the Appendix on  "Print Trains"  for those
   character  assignments.    The "OFF"  operand  translates  all
   Subscript Function characters to themselves.
<.B+>SUP (SUPerscript  characters):  <.B->defines  character pairs  ("from"<.NORMAL>
   and "to") to be used with the Superscript Function (&S').  The
   default character  assignments are those  of the  TN character
   assignments.
<.B+>TB  (TaB character):  <.B->defines a character that will be treated as<.NORMAL>
   a tab character in input text and control words.   The initial
   default value  and the  "OFF" value is  hex 05,  the  real tab
   character,  which is always recognized as a tab character even
   when .DC TB has been used to  define another.   The &SYSTB Set
   Symbol  returns the  current user-defined  tab character,   or
   hex 05 if none has been defined.
<.B+>TI   (Translate on  Input):   <.B->defines  an escape  character  that<.NORMAL>
   causes the character immediately following it to be translated
   according to the .TI translate table currently in effect.  The
   initial default  value and the "OFF"  value is a  blank.   The
   &SYSTI Set Symbol returns the current escape character.
<.B+>WORD  (Spell Word Delimiters):  <.B->define  characters that are never<.NORMAL>
   considered as part  of a word.   By default,   only the alpha-
   betics are valid characters and everything else will terminate
   a word  for purposes  of Spelling  Verification.   The  single
   quote (see .DC PUNC) is valid within a word.   Any given char-
   acter may be  either a Spell Punctuation character  or a Spell
   Word Delimiter character, but not both at the same time.
<.B+>XTEXT  (Transparent  Text):  <.B->defines the character  that delimits<.NORMAL>
   text that is transparent for purposes of justifying lines when
   it immediately follows the escape character.  Such transparent
   text  will follow  <escape><xtext> and  is  terminated on  the
   right by  an <xtext> character or  the end of the  input line.
   Any text except the <xtext> character itself,  including other
   escapes and  backspaces,  may  appear between  the delimiters.
   The initial default value and the "OFF" value is a blank.  The
   &SYSXTEXT  Set Symbol  returns  the  current transparent  text
   character.

This control word does not cause a break in any of its forms.
