EMPTY PAGE,  EXECUTE MACRO:   EMPTY  PAGE controls suppression of
empty  pages  (pages that  contain  nothing  in the  text  area);
EXECUTE MACRO treats the operand line  as a macro,  even if Macro
Substitution (.MS) is OFF.

Neither form of this control word causes a break.

<.B+>.EM <<.U+>YES<.U->|NO|OFFNO>:   <.B->The situation can  often arise in  which an<.NORMAL>
   empty page  is created (a page  that contains only  top and/or
   bottom running titles).   By default, SCRIPT does output these
   pages.  Specifying .EM YES allows SCRIPT to print them, .EM NO
   specifies that they are not to be printed, and .EM OFFNO spec-
   ifies that they are <.U+>not<.U-> <.U->to be printed and that the page number<.NORMAL>
   is <.U+>not<.U->  <.U->to be incremented.    ".EM YES" is the  initial value.<.NORMAL>
   Empty pages  will be printed  unless ".em no"  is encountered.
   If the operand is omitted then "YES" is assumed.
<.B+>.EM  .macro <parameters>:   <.B->If  the operands  are  missing it  is<.NORMAL>
   treated as EMPTY  PAGE (See above).   If the  first operand of
   the ".EM" control  word begins with a  control word indicator,
   then that first operand is treated  as a Macro or Remote name.
   Optional  keyword and  positional  parameters  may follow  the
   macro name.   The local set symbol &*0  is set to the count of
   positional parameters and &*1, &*2, etc. contain their values.
   The symbol  &* contains the  entire parameter  list.   Keyword
   parameters are accessed as set symbols by the keyword name.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .EM .TEST parm1 KW1=parm2
    A macro named TEST is invoked; &*0 is set to 1, &*1 is set to
    "parm1",   &KW1  is  set  to  "parm2",   and  &*  is  set  to
    "parm1 KW1=parm2".
(2) .EM .SK 1
    A macro named  "SK" is invoked.   A native  control word will
    never be assumed; If the specified macro has not already been
    defined, an error will result.
