This control  word does  not cause a  break.   The  first operand
specifies which  workfile is to  be used (from  1 to 9);   if not
specified,  "1" is assumed.   The first occurrence of .PU control
word for the file  causes the file to be opened.    If the "line"
operand is omitted then the output file will be closed.  An IMBED
(.IM) or APPEND (.AP)  with a numeric filename will close a work-
file created with .PU before processing the file as input.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) In the OS/VS batch environment,   workfiles must be allocated
    with a DDname of "SYSUSR0n", where "n" ranges from 1 to 9.
(2) In CMS,  workfiles  are allocated for you with  a "fileid" of
    "SYSUSR0n SCRIPT",  but this may be  overridden with your own
    FILEDEF with the PERM option before invoking SCRIPT,  or with
    a FILEDEF in  a SYSTEM (.SY)  control word  within the SCRIPT
    file.
(3) The  default   file  attributes  are   RECFM=VB,   LRECL=136,
    BLKSIZE=800.  A fixed file may also be created, in which case
    the defaults are RECFM=FB, LRECL=80, BLKSIZE=800.
(4) If the file is defined with  a DISPosition of MOD then output
    records will be added to the end of the file.  If the file is
    not defined  with a  DISPosition of  MOD then  output records
    will replace the file.
