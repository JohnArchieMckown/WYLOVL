When the SPELLCHK option has been specified,  input text is veri-
fied against words  found in a "dictionary"  of correctly spelled
words.   Since  this dictionary does  not contain all  words from
every specialized discipline,  the Dictionary Update control word
allows the  correct spelling of more  words to be  defined.   The
words specified  are treated as root  words and are  eligible for
prefix and suffix  removal as described under  Spelling Verifica-
tion (.SV).

   The case, upper and lower, of operand words is honoured in the
process of spelling verification.   If an operand word is entered
all in uppercase  then it will only match an  input word entirely
in uppercase.   If the operand is entered with an initial capital
letter, it will match an input word entirely in uppercase or with
an initial capital,   but will not match the word  entered with a
lowercase first  letter.   An operand  word entered  in lowercase
will match any form of that word in the input.

<.B+>ADD word  word ...:  <.B->The ADD  function of Dictionary  Update adds<.NORMAL>
   the  specified  word  or  words  to  the  user  dictionary  of
   correctly  spelled  words.    If the  word  has  already  been
   defined, no action is performed.
<.B+>DEL word  word ...:   <.B->The DELETE  function removes  the specified<.NORMAL>
   word or words from the  dictionary of correctly spelled words.
   If such  a word  does not  exist in  the user  dictionary,  no
   action is performed.

   This control word does not cause a break.   It will be treated
as a comment if the SPELLCHK  option has not been specified.   In
addition,  Spelling  Verification is only  performed on  the last
pass of  the input so  Dictionary Update  is always treated  as a
comment for input passes other than the last.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .DU ADD ascii EBCDIC
    "ASCII",  "Ascii",  "ascii" and "EBCDIC" will be verified but
    "Ebcdic" and "ebcdic" will fail.
(2) .DU ADD Pennsylvania
    the  word specified  will be  valid  only if  entered with  a

    capital first letter.
