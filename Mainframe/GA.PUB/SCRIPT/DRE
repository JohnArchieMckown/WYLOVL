This control word does not normally cause a break.   However,  if
the number of multiple columns currently  in effect is changed by
restoring the environment,   a break is created.    Also,  if the
Format Mode (.FO)  or text alignment  (.CE,  .LA,  .RI)  would be
changed, a break is created.

<.B+>envname:  <.B->The operand specifies a name  for the environment to be<.NORMAL>
   restored.  The environment to be restored must have been saved
   previously  by  Save  Environment with  a  matching  "envname"
   operand.    Environments that  are saved  with a  name may  be
   restored more than once.   The "envname"  may be up to sixteen
   characters in length and it is treated as if entered in upper-
   case.

      If the  "envname" operand  is not  specified,  the  Restore
   Environment control word will  restore the formatting environ-
   ment from a push-down stack of up to ten levels created by the
   most  recent  Save  Environment  control  word  used  with  no
   "envname" operand.   An error message  will result if there is
   no corresponding Save Environment control word preceding.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) This control  word is  useful when you  wish to  preserve the
    environment because  you are going  to do something  that may
    change it,  such as imbedding another file about which little
    is known:
         .sa;.im unknown;.re
(2) Environments can be created by name:
         .fo off;.in .5i;.hy off;.tp 1i 2i
         .sa Heading
    and restored later:
         .re Heading
