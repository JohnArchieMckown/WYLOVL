TOP MARGIN specifies  the number of lines to be  left between the
top of the output page and the first line of the text area.

     |  .TM  |    <<.U+>6<.U->|n|+n|-n>                              |<.NORMAL>

<.B+><<.U+>6<.U->|n>:  <.B->At the top of all  subsequent output pages (including the<.NORMAL>
   current page, if empty), "n" lines will appear between the top
   of the page and the first line of the text area.
<.B+><+n|-n>:  <.B->this value  will be added algebraically  to the current<.NORMAL>
   top  margin value,   so long  as  the resulting  value is  not
   negative.

This control word  causes a break.   If used  without an operand,
the value of the TMargin option  will be taken,  normally 6.   If
the Heading Margin is "hm",  the  Heading Space is "hs",  and the
Top Margin "tm", then the top of each page will contain:
(1) "tm" - "hm" - "hs" blank lines, followed by
(2) "hs" top-title lines, followed by
(3) "hm" blank lines.

The Heading Margin plus Heading Space must always be less than or
equal to the Top Margin.
