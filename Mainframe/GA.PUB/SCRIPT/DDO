DO may  be used following  a Then or  Else control word  to allow
multiple input lines to be conditionally processed.

This control word may only be used  as the object of a Then (.TH)
or Else  (.EL)  control word.   The  input control word  and text
lines from  the .DO to  the next corresponding  ".DO END" control
word are all  treated as the object  of the Then or  Else and are
processed  or  ignored  depending  on  the  truth  value  of  the
preceding .IF control word.

   Further Ifs within a Do group  are valid,  as are Imbeds (.IM)
and Execute  Macros (.EM).   This control  word does not  cause a
break,  although control  words within the Do group  may create a
break.  If no operand is specified then BEGIN is assumed.

(1) .if '&copy' = 'F'
    .th .do begin
    .   .rt top //FINAL COPY//
    .do end
    .el .do begin
    .   .rt top //DRAFT COPY//
    .do end
    This will define one of two Top Titles depending on the value
    of "&copy".
