EXECUTE CONTROL WORD treats the operand  line as a native control
word even if a macro is defined with the same name.

This control word does not cause  a break;  however,  the control
word in its operand field may.  The first operand must start with
a control word  indicator character,  normally period  ".".   Two
control word indicator characters in a  row before a control word
provide the same function of disabling macro calls.

    .cc 3
    .dm SK end
    This  ensures that  there are  always at  least three  usable
    lines  remaining  in  the  text  area  after  a  SKIP.    The
    ".ec .SK &*" could have been coded as "..SK &*" instead.
