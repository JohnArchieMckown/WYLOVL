RUNNING TITLE defines a three-string title  line to be printed at
the top and/or bottom of even- and/or odd-numbered pages.

<.B+><<.U+>TOP<.U->|BOTTOM>:  <.B->Normally the  title is to be printed  at the "TOP"<.NORMAL>
   of the  page in the Heading  Space area,  but "BOTTOM"  may be
   specified to  cause the  title to print  in the  Footing Space
   area at the bottom of a page.
<.B+><<.U+>ALL<.U->|EVEN|ODD>:  <.B->Normally the titles apply  to "ALL" pages,  both<.NORMAL>
   even and odd.   (An odd-numbered page is bound on the left, an
   even-numbered on the right.)  "EVEN" or "ODD" may be specified
   to cause the titles to apply to only those pages.
<.B+><<.U+>NOFILL<.U->|FILL>:  <.B->The  s2 character string  is normally  centred on<.NORMAL>
   the page between the  s1 string on the left and  the s3 string
   on the right.  If "FILL" is specified the s2 string is treated
   as a tab fill  string placed between s1 on the  left and s3 on
   the right.   If s2 is omitted,  it  will be treated as a blank
   fill string.
<.B+><<.U+>1<.U->|n> /s1/s2/s3/:  <.B->The value "n"  (1,  if omitted)  specifies the<.NORMAL>
   title line number  in the Heading Space  (.HS)  and/or Footing
   Space (.FS)  area.   Title line number 1  is at the top of the
   Heading Space  and at the bottom  of the Footing  Space.   The
   values of s1, s2,  and s3 are character strings not containing
   the delimiter character "/".   The  delimiter character can be
   any character not contained in any of the three strings.   Any
   of the strings may be omitted, but all four delimiters must be
   included to indicate missing strings, such as /s1//s3/.

When the title lines are printed,   the current Page Symbol (.PS)
character in any title is replaced  with the current page number.
This  control word  does not  cause  a break.    The default  TOP
running   title    on   all    pages   after    the   first    is
".rt TOP ALL 1 ///PAGE %/" and  the default BOTTOM  running title
on all pages is ".rt BOTTOM ALL 1 ////".

   For output devices that support fonts,  the running titles are
always displayed in the font that is  in effect when the title is
defined.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) The  following will  define  a running  top  title that  will
    appear on  all pages  hereafter,  provided  that the  Heading

    Space value is greater than or equal to one.
       .rt top /SCRIPT Reference Manual//page %/
    As long  as the .PS character  is "%",  the page  number will
    appear in the top title each time SCRIPT prints it at the top
    of a page.
