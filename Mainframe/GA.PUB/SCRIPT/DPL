PAGE LENGTH specifies  the physical size of the  output page,  in
terms of the number of lines on the page.

This control word causes a break.   The initial and default value
is the value of the PLength  SCRIPT option (if not specified when
SCRIPT was invoked,   then 66 if the EIGHT option  was not speci-
fied,  or  88 if EIGHT was  specified).ац An integer  operand "n"
changes the value to "n lines on the physical page".   An operand
of the  form "+n" or  "-n" adds  this value algebraically  to the
current page length,   so long as the resulting  value is greater
than the TOP MARGIN (.TM) plus BOTTOM MARGIN (.BM).

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) To be used properly (if at  all),  .PL should be specified at
    the beginning  of your  input file,   and then  never altered
    thereafter.  Use of .PL for any other purpose than specifying
    the actual <.U+>physical<.U-> <.U->size of the  output paper may yield inap-<.NORMAL>
    propriate results;  .TM and .BM should be used to control the
    placement of the text area on the physical page.
(2) If the  Page Length value is  "very" large so that  there are
    more than 999 lines  between the last line of text  on a page
    and the start  of Footnotes or the Bottom  Margin area,  only
    one  blank line  will  be left.    This  could  be used  when
    producing output on one "long", single page.

ац For any  output device  that prints  at 6  lines per  vertical
   inch,  an 8.5x11"  page has 66 lines  on it.   At 8  lines per
   inch, it has 88 lines.
