This control word does not cause a break.  The operands and other
considerations are identical to those for the other control words
that emphasize text.  See .BD for details.

(3) .us on
    This is a simple test of underscoring some
    input text.
    .ud on 40
    And now we will underscore the interword blanks,
    but justification can continue.
    Since the period is not underscored there
    are still blanks between sentences.
    .ud on . ?
    Now even the sentences will be joined because
    the special characters period and question mark
    are also underscored.
    How does it look?
         Note that leading blanks on a line are not
    underscored.
