INDENT RIGHT  indents the  end of the  output line  the specified
horizontal position with respect to  the line-length (.LL)  value
(or .CL in multiple-column mode).

This control word causes a break.  The initial Right Indent value
is zero.  If the operand is omitted zero is assumed.   An operand
of  the form  "+h"  adds to  the current  Right  Indent and  "-h"
subtracts from it.    This indentation remains in  effect for all
subsequent output lines until another  .IR or .IN is encountered.
".IR"  or ".IR 0"  will cancel  the right  indentation and  cause
output to be formatted to the original right margin.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .in 4
    The first paragraph demonstrates the normal width
    of formatted text.
    It extends to the current Line Length.
    .ir 4
    The second paragraph demonstrates the width of formatted
    text with a Right Indent specified.
    Note that the Left Indent is unchanged.
    .ir;The third paragraph again demonstrates the normal
    width of formatted text.

This example produces the following output:

    The  first   paragraph  demonstrates  the  normal   width  of
    formatted text.  It extends to the current Line Length.
    The second paragraph demonstrates  the width of formatted
    text with a Right Indent  specified.   Note that the Left
    Indent is unchanged.
    The third  paragraph again demonstrates  the normal  width of
    formatted text.
