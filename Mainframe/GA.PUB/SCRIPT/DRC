REVISION CODE  allows selected input text  lines to be  marked in
the page margins  with a user-defined revision  code character or
string.

This control word does not cause a break.  It is used to define a
character or string to mark formatted  output and to identify the
input  text that  is  to be  marked with  revisions  in the  page
margins.

<.B+>n:  <.B->defines the revision code number.   It must be specified, and<.NORMAL>
   may range from 1 to 99.   Therefore,  up to 99 revision levels
   may be defined and used in a document.
<.B+>n <char>:   <.B->is the  definition of  a revision-code  character for<.NORMAL>
   revision "n" sections.  Only a single character operand may be
   specified.   If  no character operand  is specified,   a blank
   character is assumed.
<.B+>n  'string':  <.B->is  the definition  of a  revision-code string  for<.NORMAL>
   revision "n" sections.   The string may be up to 10 characters
   in length, and must be delimited before and after.
<.B+>n ON:   <.B->marks the start of  a revision "n" section.    All output<.NORMAL>
   lines thereafter  will have  the previously-defined  revision-
   code string or character printed  in the page margins,  beside
   the formatted text.
<.B+>n  OFF:  <.B->terminates  the  printing  of the  revision-section  "n"<.NORMAL>
   string or character on output lines.
<.B+>n ON/OFF:   <.B->indicates both the  start and  the end of  a revision<.NORMAL>
   section "n".   The formatted output text generated by the next
   input text line will be marked with the corresponding revision
   code character or string.
<.B+>* <char|'string'>:  <.B->will mark the output from the next input text<.NORMAL>
   line with the specified character or string.  If the character
   or string  is omitted,  a blank  character will be  used.   It
   works like the "ON/OFF" operand  except the revision marker is
   specified with the control word.
<.B+>SET <LEFT|RIGHT>:   <.B->defines whether  revision markers  are to  be<.NORMAL>
   printed in the left page margin (one blank before the start of
   output text)  or in the right page margin (one blank after the
   current Line  Length).   The  default is  "LEFT" which  may be
   overridden with  a last "LEFT|RIGHT"  operand on  the revision
   code definition.   This in turn may  be overridden with a last
   "LEFT|RIGHT" operand  in a control  word which  begins revised

   input text.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) A revision-code  character or string  cannot contain  the tab
    character.
(2) If a revision  code character or string has  not been defined
    for revision section "n" before an ON,  ON/OFF or "*" operand
    can be used  for section "n" then a  blank revision character
    is assumed.
(3) Revision sections can be nested one within another,  but they
    must be  terminated in the reverse  order to which  they were
    started.  Put another way, only the most-recently-begun revi-
    sion section may be terminated.

   It is the user's responsibility to  set the ADJUST value large
enough to allow for the  printing of any revision-code characters
or strings on  the LEFT.   They will be  right-adjusted one blank
from the end of  the ADJUST space,  and will be  truncated on the
left if insufficient space is available.   If the ADJUST space is
less than 2 when a revision section is started, space is made for
revision characters by shifting all output lines up to two spaces
to the right until the revision section is terminated.
