LEADING TAB  is generated internally by  SCRIPT to cause  a break
before processing  an input  line that  begins with  one or  more
leading tabs.

This control word causes a break.  An input text line that begins
with a tab will normally cause a break in the output (see .BR for
details).  The break is actually caused by the ".LT" control word
that is generated and executed by SCRIPT before the text with the
leading tab  is processed.   You can  alter this by using  .DM to
define a "LT" macro to do whatever is appropriate for your needs.
If a  "LT" macro  is defined,   the original  input line  will be
processed immediately afterwards;  the leading tab(s)  will still
be present  but will not cause  a break unless something  in your
macro causes  one.   When  generated,  this  control word  has no
operand line.    It is not generated  by SCRIPT to cause  a break
when ".LI ON" is in effect.

    The above example produces the following output:
                   twenty .............forty
