Defines an "n"-line Bottom Margin.   An  operand of the form "+n"
or  "-n" adds  this value  algebraically to  the current  Footing
Margin setting,  so long as the  resulting value is not negative.
This control word causes a break.  If the operand is omitted, the
value of the FMargin SCRIPT option  will be taken (1 by default).
The initial and default Footing Margin is 1 if the FMargin option
was not specified.   See the .BM description for the relationship
between .FM, .FS, and .BM.
