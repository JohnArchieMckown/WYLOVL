ADJUST positions the beginning of the output page with respect to
the physical left margin of the output device.

<.B+><<.U+>0<.U->|h|+h|-h>:  <.B->A value  of the form "h" positions  the first char-<.NORMAL>
   acter of the output line "h" spaces  to the right of the first
   possible print position of the output device.   A value of the
   form "+h"  adds "h"  spaces to the  current adjust  value.   A
   value of the  form "-h" subtracts "h" from  the current adjust
   value.
<.B+><EVEN|ODD>:  <.B->If "EVEN"  is specified as the  first operand,  then<.NORMAL>
   even-numbered pages will be adjusted by the sum of the current
   adjust value plus the specified value.  The "ODD" option works
   in the same way for odd-numbered pages.

This control word  causes a break.   The adjust  value remains in
effect for all  subsequent output lines until  altered by another
".AD" control word.   If .AD is  specified with no operands,  the
adjust value is assumed from the  initial value set by the ADJUST
or CENTER options, normally zero.  The default for an EVEN or ODD
Adjust is always zero.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) Specifying ADJUST  values is  something that  should be  done
    only at  the start of the  input file;  in most  cases,  they
    should not be altered thereafter.
(2) The current adjust  value may be accessed via  the &SYSAD Set
    Symbol.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .ad 1.5i
    sets an adjust value of one-and-one-half inches.
(2) .if &SYSAD LT 5 .th .ad 5
    ensures  that  the current  adjust  value  is at  least  five
    spaces.
