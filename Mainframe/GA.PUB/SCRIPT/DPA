This control word causes a break.    When it is encountered,  the
rest of the current page is skipped, any saved footnote lines are
printed,  the Footing Space lines are printed,  and a new page is
begun.

<.B+><<.U+>YES<.U->|NO|ODD|EVEN>:  <.B->YES terminates the current page,  even if the<.NORMAL>
   current page is empty.  The number of the new page will be one
   greater than that of the page on which the .PA occurred.   YES
   is equivalent to  a .PA with no operands.    NO suppresses the
   page eject.  ODD positions to the top of the next odd-numbered
   page if not already there.   EVEN  positions to the top of the
   next even-numbered page if not already there.
<.B+><n|+n|-n <m|+m|-m>>:   <.B->An operand of the  form "n" will  make the<.NORMAL>
   new page  be numbered  "n".   A  "+n" will  make the  new page
   number be "n" greater than the number of the page on which the
   .PA occurred,  and  "-n" will make it be "n"  less.   A second
   operand of  the form "m" may  optionally be specified  to make
   SCRIPT number and count pages in the form "n.m",  incrementing
   "m" on each page instead of "n".   Thus a chapter or an update
   to be page-numbered 3, 3.1, 3.2, ... would be started by spec-
   ifying ".PA 3 0".

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) If the  STOP option  was specified  when SCRIPT  was invoked,
    then each time the bottom of  a page is reached,  SCRIPT will
    eject the  page and  pause to  allow you  to insert  the next
    sheet of paper.
(2) If the current page is empty  and ".EM NO" is in effect,  .PA
    has no effect other than causing the page number to be incre-
    mented or reset.   Consequently,  top  running titles are not
    printed until there is a line about to be printed in the text
    area.   This allows you to do  the "page eject" and THEN make
    whatever changes are required to the page-layout environment.
(3) When numbering pages with a decimal portion,  the even or odd
    attribute is  determined by summing  the two portions  of the
    page number.  Thus 3.0 is odd and 3.1 is even, 4.5 is odd and
    4.6 is even.
(4) If the current page number is "3.4"  then a .PA with no oper-
    ands word would place the output at the top of page "4".
