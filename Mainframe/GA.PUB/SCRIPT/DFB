FLOATING BLOCK  allows the user to  create an "in-core"  block of
text that will not be printed until the user chooses to print it.

<.B+><BEGIN|END <<.U+>0<.U->|m>>:  <.B->When the ".FB BEGIN"  control word is encoun-<.NORMAL>
   tered,  the values of all relevant print control variables are
   saved and SCRIPT prepares to accept Floating Block text.  When
   the ".FB END" control word is  encountered,  a break is caused
   for text within the block and  the former values are restored.
   If an integer "m" is specified,   it is added algebraically to
   the count of the number of lines in the block.   If not speci-
   fied,  the default is zero.   More than one Floating Block may
   be created before being output.
<.B+><DUMP <n>>:  <.B->causes the first "n" Floating Blocks to be output to<.NORMAL>
   the text area.    If "n" is not specified,   then all existing
   Floating Blocks are output.

This control word causes a break only with the "DUMP" operand.  A
first operand must be provided as none will be assumed.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) See the discussion under the .CC control word for the list of
    control words that may not be used within the BEGIN/END range
    of a .FB block.
(2) The  &SYSFBC System  Set  Symbol can  be  examined after  the
    ".FB END" control word to determine the count of lines within
    all outstanding blocks.   The SYSFBF System Set Symbol can be
    used  to  determine  the  count of  lines  within  the  first
    outstanding block.
