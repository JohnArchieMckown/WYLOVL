This control word causes a break.

<.B+><<.U+>1<.U->|n|* <<.U+>CONTENTS<.U->|line|/>>:  <.B->The  table-of-contents workarea indi-<.NORMAL>
   cated  by the  most  recent ".DH SET"  is  printed.   The  "n"
   operand specifies the  number of pages to be  reserved for it.
   If it consumes other than "n" pages, a gap or overlap in page-
   numbering will  occur.   A default of  1 page is used  if this
   operand  is not  specified.   An  operand of  "*" causes  page
   numbering to proceed  sequentially;  this is the  operand that
   you will probably use most often.

      The "line" operand will be used to create the title for the
   table of contents.   If not specified, the title <.U+>CONTENTS<.U-> <.U->will<.NORMAL>
   be used.   It is handled by  SCRIPT by internally generating a
   "pseudo .HL 1" control word with the title as operand,  and is
   therefore printed with whatever .HL operands are in effect for
   level-one headings.   This pseudo head-level becomes the first
   entry in  the Table  of Contents  and normally  causes a  page
   eject if not already  at the top of the page.    If the "line"
   operand is a  single slash character '/' then  no head-level 1
   is processed before printing the table-of-contents workarea.
<.B+>ADD <m ...  >:  <.B->causes  the table-of-contents workareas specified<.NORMAL>
   by <m ... > to be added  to the current workarea.   Attempting
   to chain the current workarea to  itself will result in a null
   operation.
<.B+>DELETE:  <.B->deletes  the current table-of-contents  workarea without<.NORMAL>
   printing it.

The  contents  of  the   table-of-contents  workarea  is  printed
according to the formatting environment in effect at the time the
.TC is encountered,  NOT what was in effect when lines were added
to the workarea.   The .TC control word is not allowed within the
BEGIN/END range of any control word  that creates an in-core text
block.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.U-> <.U->Since the  Table of Contents for this  manual is created<.NORMAL>
using table-of-contents  workarea "0",  the following  example is
preceded and  followed by a  ".DH SET 9" and  ".DH SET 0" respec-
tively, to keep it separate from the manual's Table of Contents.

  .dh set 9
  .dh 4 tc
  .h1 1.0 This is a level-one heading
  text lines, etc.
  .h2 1.1 This is a level-two heading
  text lines, etc.

The above sequence of control words and text produces the results
on the the following pages.  The "text lines, etc" sequences have
been replaced  by descriptions  of the  appropriate heading-level
control words.

<.U+>1<.U->.<.U+>0 THIS IS A LEVEL-ONE HEADING<.NORMAL>

A level-one heading has the following default characteristics:

-    Starts at the top of a new page.
-    Is right justified if it falls on an odd-numbered page.
-    Is typed in uppercase and underscored.
-    Is followed by five spaces.

<.U+>1<.U->.<.U+>1 THIS IS A LEVEL-TWO HEADING<.NORMAL>

A level-two heading has the following default characteristics:

-    Has three line skips before it.
-    Is typed in uppercase and underscored.
-    Is followed by two spaces.

1.1.1 THIS IS A LEVEL-THREE HEADING

A level-three heading has the following default characteristics:

-    Has three line skips before it.
-    Is typed in uppercase letters.
-    Is followed by two spaces.

<.U+>1<.U->.<.U+>1<.U->.<.U+>1<.U->.<.U+>1 This is a level-four heading<.NORMAL>

A level-four heading has the following default characteristics:

-    Has three line skips before it.
-    Is underscored.
-    Is followed by two spaces.

                                                 <.U+>EXAMPLE CONTENTS<.NORMAL>
