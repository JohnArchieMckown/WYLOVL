input line is encountered.

This control word does not cause a break.  Any operands specified
will be ignored.   Any pending input continuation will be cleared
if the previous input line ended with a continuation character.

   A null input record may result from Terminal input (.TE), from
a macro definition line  or as a result of substitution  of a set
symbol that has  a null value.   If some other  effect is desired
for null input records then you may  define a macro named "NL" to
perform whatever is required.

   An input line  that contains at only a blank  are processed by
the  Blank Line  (.BL)   control word.    A  null  input line  is
different from a blank input line.

(1) .dm NL /.br/
    Once this macro has been defined,  any null lines encountered
    in the  input will cause the  NL macro to be  invoked,  which
    will cause a break.
(2) .dm NL /.br/.cc 2/
    Each time a null input line is encountered, the NL macro will
    cause  a break  and make  sure that  there are  at least  two
    usable lines remaining in the text area.
