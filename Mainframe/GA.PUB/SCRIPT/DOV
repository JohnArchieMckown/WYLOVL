This control word  does not cause a break.    Every occurrence of
blank in the subsequent text input  lines will be replaced by the
corresponding character in the "string", up to the maximum length
of  the "string"  and  the input  text  line.    An "ON"  operand
continues the process indefinitely.   An "OFF" operand terminates
the  process.    A  "DELETE" operand  purges  the  entire  queue.
Multiple Input Overlay  strings are queued.   See  Output Overlay
(.OO) for more information.
