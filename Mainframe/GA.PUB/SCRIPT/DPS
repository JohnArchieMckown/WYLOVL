PAGE NUMBER SYMBOL defines the character that SCRIPT is to recog-
nize in running titles as the character that is to be replaced by
the "print-image form" of the current page number,  including any
prefix and/or suffix set by the .PN control word.

This control word does not cause a break.   The initial character
is the percent sign (%).   OFF, or no operand at all, will termi-
nate recognition of the page number symbol.  ON will set the page
number symbol to the initial value of "%".

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) Once a  character is specified,   the previous  character (if
    any)  will no longer have any special significance in running
    titles and  will just be treated  as part of the  title text.
    Therefore,  running titles  may have to be  re-defined at the
    same time.
(2) The current  Page Symbol  character will  be recognized  as a
    "variable" whose value is the print-image form of the current
    output page number by the .SR control word.
      .se pagenumber = %
    will  assign the  set symbol  'pagenumber' the  value of  the
    current printable page number.
