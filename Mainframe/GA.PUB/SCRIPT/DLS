LINE SPACING causes  zero or more "conditional  skip" blank lines
to be produced after each output line in the text area.

<.B+><<.U+>0<.U->|n|+n|-n>:   <.B->After each  subsequent output  line,  SCRIPT  will<.NORMAL>
   internally  generate  a ".SK n C".    Therefore,   consecutive
   output lines created  by text will be separated  by (at least)
   "n" blank lines.   If a SKIP (.SK) or SPACE (.SP) control word
   is used to create blank lines between text, the maximum of the
   .SK or .SP value and the  "conditional skip" .LS value will be
   used.   The operand may be signed,   in which case the current
   line space value is incremented or decremented.
<.B+><ON|OFF>:  <.B->ON  implies one  line or  Double Spacing  (.DS).   OFF<.NORMAL>
   implies zero lines or Single Spacing (.SS).

This control word causes a break.   An omitted operand is treated
as Single Space.   ".SK" and ".SP" control words encountered with
".LS n" in effect  will produce "n" times the  specified skips or
spaces.   SKIP and SPACE control  words specified with the "Abso-
lute" operand will always produce "n"  blank lines in the output.
A ".FN BEGIN" sets the  .LS value to 0 at the  start of the foot-
note.   Numeric operands of .CC and .CP are not multiplied by "n"
when ".LS n" is in effect.
