SET SYMBOL allows the user to assign a character or numeric value
to a Set Symbol.    It is an alternate to .SR  that will function
even when .SU is OFF.

This control word does not cause a break.   Substitution is auto-
matically applied to the operands to replace any Set Symbols with
their values,   and the result  is then  processed as if  the .SR
control word had  been used instead.   For  details and examples,
see the .SR description.
