This control word causes a break.    If Multiple Column is not in
effect when  this control word is  encountered,  a break  will be
caused,  and no other action.    If a multiple-column environment
was in  effect when the .SC  is encountered,  the output  to that
point will be  formatted according to the  current Column Defini-
tion and Balance Column control words,  and the Line Length (.LL)
will be restored before proceeding.

    (.CD) control word.
(2) This control  word is illegal  within the BEGIN/END  range of
    any control word that creates an in-core text block.
