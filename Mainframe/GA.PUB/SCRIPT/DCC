CONDITIONAL COLUMN positions output to the top of the next column
if insufficient lines remain in the  current column (or page,  if
in single-column mode).

If no operand is specified,  this control word will cause a break
and then, if the output is not already positioned at the top of a
column, it will position to the top of the next column.

<.B+>n:   <.B->With a  numeric  operand,  a  check is  made  for "n"  lines<.NORMAL>
   remaining in the current column.   If "n" lines do not remain,
   a COLUMN  BEGIN is  performed,  which  also makes  the current
   column ineligible for balancing.   If "n" lines do remain,  no
   action  is performed,   but if  BALANCE COLUMNS  is "ON"  then
   output in the  current column may be split  by later balancing
   of column  text.   If "n"  is not  positive then no  action is
   performed.
<.B+><BEGIN|INLINE>:  <.B->starts a "conditional column" block.  If started<.NORMAL>
   with "BEGIN",  this control word  causes a break.   If started
   with "INLINE",  it  does not (any not-yet-printed  output line
   will become the first line of  the block).   All output there-
   after becomes part of this "block".
<.B+>END <<.U+>0<.U->|m>:   <.B->terminates a  "conditional column"  block.   If  the<.NORMAL>
   block was started with "INLINE", no break is caused; the block
   does not include  the current not-yet-printed output  line (if
   any).    The "END"  operand may  be further  qualified with  a
   numeric operand "m".   This value is added to the count of the
   number of output  lines in the block before  SCRIPT decides if
   the block  will fit in  the current column.    If insufficient
   lines remain in the current column,Æ  SCRIPT ejects to the top
   of the next column before printing the block.   Otherwise, the
   block prints immediately.    If a "conditional" SKIP  or SPACE
   terminates the block,  the conditional SKIPs or SPACEs are put
   into effect AFTER the block is output.

"In-core" text blocks are created  via begin/end sequences of the
.CC, .CP, .FB, .FK, and .FN control words.   These control words,
_____________________

Æ The number of lines between the  current position in the column
  and the first line reserved for footnotes (if any)  or the last
  line of the text area (if no footnotes are currently waiting to
  print).

control words that cause column or page ejects, and control words
that alter the columns-per-page environment (.CD, .MC,  .SC)  may
NOT occur WITHIN an in-core block.
