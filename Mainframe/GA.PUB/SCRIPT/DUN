UNDENT causes the  next output line to start  the specified hori-
zontal distance to the left of the current left Indent value.

This control word causes a break.   It produces a one-output-line
effect only.  If used with no operand, "zero" will be assumed.  A
relative change as in "+h" or  "-h" changes the previously speci-
fied Undent or Indent Line (.IL).

   The Undent  remains in effect  until the next  Undent,  Indent
(.IN) or Indent Line (.IL) control word.

   The undentation may not exceed  the current indentation.   The
.UN and  .OF control words achieve  the same visual  effect;  the
choice between  the two is largely  a matter of  personal prefer-
ence.
