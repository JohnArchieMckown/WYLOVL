CENTER centers the  specified number of text  input lines between
the  margins  currently defined  by  the  left and  right  indent
values.

<.B+><<.U+>1<.U->|n>:  <.B->The next "n" input text lines will be centered on output.<.NORMAL>
<.B+><ON|OFF>:  <.B->ON causes all text lines  thereafter to be centered on<.NORMAL>
   output.   OFF terminates the centering  effect initiated by ON
   or "n".
<.B+>line:  <.B->The result of the specified input "line" will be centered.<.NORMAL>
   The "line" can be either simple text or a control-word line.

This control  word causes  a break.   Any  leading blanks  at the
beginning of a text input line to be centered will be included in
the count of characters to be  centered.   If the input text line
is longer than the output line  length,  that leftmost portion of
the input line that will fit on the output line will be centered,
and the remainder of the input line  will be centered on the next
output line(s).  The effect of CENTERing is terminated by the OFF
operand or by  the next occurrence of  Concatenate (.CO),  Format
(.FO), Left Adjust (.LA) or Right Adjust (.RI).

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .ce This will be centered.
    produces:
                       This will be centered.
(2) .ce .us Underscored text to be centered.
    produces:
                  <.U+>Underscored text to be centered<.U->.<.NORMAL>
(3) .ce 3;first line
    .sk;second line
    third line
    produces:
                             first line

                             second line
                             third line
(4) Do  not attempt  to  use a  numeric  expression  as a  "line"
    operand,  because it  will be taken as an  "n" operand.   For
    example,  ".CE (1988)" will center the  next 1988 input lines
    of text and not the  string "(1988)".   Use ".CE 1;(1988)" or
    ".CE;(1988)" instead.
