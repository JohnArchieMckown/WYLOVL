INDEX ENTRY controls the formatting of the entries for each level
of headers in an index structure.

<.B+><.U+>Printing the Index<.NORMAL>

<.B+>H character:   <.B->An Index Entry control  word is generated  with an<.NORMAL>
   'H'  operand before  each new  first character  for the  first
   level headers.   The  new character follows as  the second and
   last operand.   The new character is displayed,  followed by a
   blank line.
<.B+>1|2|3 string:  <.B->The control word is generated before printing each<.NORMAL>
   header level in the index structure.    The first operand is a
   numeric indicating  which header level and  references follow.
   The header level  string itself follows.   Each  level sets an
   indentation from  the left  margin to  show the  level of  the
   index header.

<.B+><.U+>Customizing the Index Format<.NORMAL>

Four macros may be defined to control how the index levels are to
be formatted.
(1) IEH is invoked when the first  character of a level one index
    header changes.    At is invoked  with one operand,   so that
    Local Symbol  &* may be used  to access the new  character is
    now beginning.
(2) IE1 is invoked before a level-one index header.
(3) IE2 is invoked before a level-two index header.
(4) IE3 is invoked before a level-three index header.

In the latter  3 macros,  the Local Symbol &*  contains the index
header to follow.   The string  "&SYSIXREF." is placed between an
index header and its reference data if reference data is present.
The initial  value for  this System  Set Symbol  is ", "  (comma-
blank) but may be redefined by the user.   Therefore substitution
(.SU) must be ON when printing the index.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) For compatibility with previous versions of SCRIPT the native
    Index Entry control word will generate a macro call to macros
    SYSIX0, SYSIX1,  SYSIX2 and SYSIX3 if they are defined.   The

    implementation is identical to  previous versions except that
    the System Set Symbol &SYSIXOP is no longer supported.  Refer
    to Local Set Symbol &* in macros IE1,  IE2 and IE3 if this is
    required.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) The following shows how index structure 1 can be printed:
    .dm IEH /.in/.sk/.cc 5/.bd 1/  &*/
    .dm IE1 /.in 3/.of 3 no/
    .dm IE2 /.in 6/.of 3 no/
    .dm IE3 /.in 9/.of 3 no/
    .se SYSIXREF = ' ... '
    .co;.ju no
    .ix . DUMP
