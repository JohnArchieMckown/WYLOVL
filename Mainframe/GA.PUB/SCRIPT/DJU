JUSTIFY causes output  lines to be padded  with inter-word blanks
to the right margin.

<.B+>OFF:  <.B->suppresses  the justification process.   If  CONCATENATE is<.NORMAL>
   OFF,  input lines will be copied to output lines on a "one for
   one" basis;  if CONCATENATE is ON, the output line will retain
   its "ragged right"  style from the point  in the concatenation
   process at which SCRIPT decides it  cannot get any more on the
   output line.
<.B+>ON:  <.B->On output devices that  support "proportional spacing",  the<.NORMAL>
   inter-word  blanks will  be  equal between  all  words on  the
   output line.   On other  devices,  the following justification
   algorithm is  used until  no blanks  remain to  be distributed
   between the words:  one extra blank is first placed after each
   period, exclamation mark, or question mark in the output line;
   then an extra  blank will be placed  after any colon  or semi-
   colon, and then after any comma or right parenthesis;  if more
   blanks must still be added they are distributed at equidistant
   places between words.
<.B+>HALF:  <.B->produces an effect between "ragged right" and "full justi-<.NORMAL>
   fication"  by only  distributing half  of the  blanks that  it
   would under "ON".
<.B+><LEFT|RIGHT|CENTRE|CENTER>:  <.B->causes the  output line to  be left-<.NORMAL>
   justified, right-justified or centered.
<.B+><INSIDE|OUTSIDE>:  <.B->INSIDE causes  odd-numbered pages to  be left-<.NORMAL>
   justified  and  even-numbered  pages  to  be  right-justified;
   OUTSIDE does the opposite.

This  control word  causes a  break.   ON  is in  effect until  a
".JU OFF" or  ".FO OFF" is encountered.    An omitted  operand is
treated as "ON".   The FORMAT control word combines the functions
of CONCATENATE and JUSTIFY.
