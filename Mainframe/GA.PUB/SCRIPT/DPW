This control  word does not cause  a break.   If used  without an
operand, a default value of zero is used instead.   An operand of
the  form "+h"  or  "-h" adds  this  value  algebraically to  the
current page width, so long as the result is not negative and not
more than 20 inches.

   The purpose of Page  Width is to define the size  of the paper
on which  the text  will be  printed,  so  that physical  markers
"could" be  added to the text  as it is printed.    These markers
would  be  used to  properly  align  the  pages in  the  printing
process,  and would  not be seen by the reader.    The Page Width
control word  is treated as a  comment for most of  the supported
output devices.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .pw 85
    This sets the Page Width to 85 characters.
(2) .pw 8.5i
    This sets the Page Width to  eight and one half inches.   The
    number of characters would depend  on the value specified for
    the Characters Per Inch (CPI) option when SCRIPT was invoked.
