CONDITIONAL PAGE  positions output  to the top  of the  next page
column if  insufficient lines  remain in  the current  column (or
page, if in single-column mode).

The  operands of  .CP are  identical to  those of  .CC;  see  the
description of .CC for details.   The only difference is that .CP
operates on <.U+>pages<.U->  <.U->instead of columns.   If no  operand is speci-<.NORMAL>
fied,  .CP  will cause a  break and then,   if the output  is not
already positioned at the top of a <.U+>page<.U->,  it will position to the<.NORMAL>
top of the next <.U+>page<.U->, independent of whether single- or multiple-<.NORMAL>
column mode is  in effect.   It should therefore be  used only in
those circumstances  where it is desirable  to start a  new page.
In other cases, the .CC control word should be used instead.
