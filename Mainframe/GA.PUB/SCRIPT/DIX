INDEX  builds an  index  structure with  up  to  three levels  of
headers with references, or prints the index structure.

This control word does not cause a break.

<.B+><<.U+>1<.U->|n>:  <.B->specifies the index structure (from 1 to 9)  on which the<.NORMAL>
   operation is  to be performed.    If omitted,  structure  1 is
   used.

<.B+><.U+>Building the Index<.NORMAL>

<.B+>'s1' <'s2' <'s3'>>:  <.B->adds up to  three levels of index headers to<.NORMAL>
   the index structure.    The index headers may  be specified as
   undelimited strings,  or as delimited  strings if they contain
   embedded blanks.   The current output page number will be used
   as the reference entry.
<.B+><<.> <ref>>:  <.B->specifies  a "reference string" that is  to be used<.NORMAL>
   instead of  the current output  page number for  the reference
   entry.   If s3 (or s2 and  s3)  are omitted,  then the control
   word indicator (normally  period)  must be placed  between the
   index level(s)  and the reference operand.   If all four oper-
   ands are present,  the use of  the control word indicator as a
   separator is  optional.   Use  of the  control word  indicator
   means a reference must follow,  even  if null (see the Example
   below).

It is  possible to  designate one  or more  reference entries  as
<.U+>primary<.U-> <.U->reference entries,  so that they will appear first in the<.NORMAL>
list of reference entries for that index header entry, regardless
of where they appeared in the  input.   If the reference entry is
an asterisk,   then the current page  number will be used  as the
primary reference entry.   If the  reference entry is a character
string starting with an asterisk,   then the characters following
the asterisk will  be used as the primary  reference entry.   The
asterisk character  used to identify  a primary reference  may be
changed with a ".DC PIX" control word.

<.B+><.U+>Printing the Index Structure<.NORMAL>

<.B+>.  <DUMP|PURGE>:  <.B->PURGE causes the  index structure to be deleted<.NORMAL>
   without printing  it.   DUMP causes it  to be output  and then
   deleted.   The index  structure will be printed  in alphabetic

   order within levels.   For purposes of alphabetizing the level
   entries,  lowercase and uppercase letters are considered to be
   identical.

      Index references on  consecutive pages are joined  with the
   hyphen character '-'  and other references are  separated by a
   comma.   Only  internally generated page numbers  are eligible
   for joining, never a user reference string.   A null reference
   between two  references on consecutive  pages will  make those
   references ineligible for joining.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .ix 'level1' 'level2'
    adds a first- and a second-level  header and the current page
    number as the reference entry, to index structure 1.
(2) .ix 2 'level1' . 'see...'
    adds a first-level  header and the reference  string "see..."
    to index structure 2.
(3) .ix 'level1' . ''
    adds a first-level header and a null reference entry to index
    structure 1.
(4) .ix 'level1' 'level2' . *
    adds a first-  and second-level index header  to index struc-
    ture 1,  using the current page number as a primary reference
    entry.
(5) .ix 'level1' . '*text'
    adds a first-level index header  to index structure 1,  using
    the characters "text" as the primary reference entry.
(6) The index structure  is printed with the  DUMP operand.   See
    the Index Entry control word (.IE) for customizing the format
    of the result.
