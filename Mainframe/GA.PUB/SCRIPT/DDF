DEFINE  FONT defines  a  user font  name to  represent  a set  of
logical font  identifiers.   For  output devices  that support  a
range of pointsizes, the pointsize may also be specified.

This control  word does not cause  a break.   It defines  a "font
name" that  will represent a set  of up to four  font identifiers
and their pointsizes to be called on later.  A fontname may be up
to twelve  arbitrary characters  in length and  is treated  as if
entered in uppercase.

   The  logical font  identifiers and  their optional  pointsizes
follow.   The first is a Roman or  Normal font,  used by a normal
character in an input text record.  The second is an Italic font,
used whenever a character is underscored.  The underscoring might
exist in  the original input  or be  the result of  an Underscore
(.US) or Underscore and Capitalize (.UC) control word.  The third
is a Bold  font,  used whenever an input  character is overstruck
with itself.   This can be done with the Bold (.BD) control word.
The fourth automatic font is the Bold Italic font.  A Bold Italic
character is one  that is both overstruck with  itself and under-
scored, as happens with the Bold Italic (.BI) control word.

   The fontnames that correspond to  the automatic font selection
for an input  character are assigned by Define  Font.   The first
Define Fontname  becomes the default set  of fonts to be  used by
SCRIPT if none other has been specified by Begin Font (.BF).

   The construction of the logical  font definitions with .PH and
linking them to a Font Definition  can be tedious and error prone
to  a user  who knows  less  than everything  about a  particular
output device and its fonts.

<.B+>SYSAPS:  <.B->To  greatly simplify the  definition of  a set of  up to<.NORMAL>
   four logical fonts  in a Fontname,  a  sample interface driver
   file called SYSAPS  is provided for a Autologic  Micro 5 type-
   setter.   In it  simplest form,  you must imbed  SYSAPS with a
   type-style operand of four letters.  For example,
     .im SYSAPS FONT standard time
   brings in one logical font,   "Times-Roman".   The Fontname is
   "standard".  The pointsize is set to the default PSIZE option.
   To  define the  same  font with  a pointsize  of  8 you  would
   specify,
     .im SYSAPS FONT standard time 8
   If  your document  requires  more  than one  type-style,   the

   Italic, Bold and Bold-Italic font identifiers would follow the
   Roman specification.  For example,
     .im SYSAPS FONT standard time 8 time 8 time 8 time 8
   would define  a user  fontname of  "standard" containing  four
   Logical Fonts:   the first for ROMAN, ITALIC,  BOLD and lastly
   BOLD-ITALIC.

      The normal order  can be altered by  specifying a qualifier
   for the font name, as in:
     .im SYSAPS FONT heading times-bold-italic 12
   When the "heading"  fontname is used in Begin  Font,  all text
   whether underscored  or not  will appear  in TIMES-BOLD-ITALIC
   with a pointsize of 12.   Finally  a wide variety of fonts can
   be accommodated in a single Font Identifier as in:
     .im SYSAPS FONT fred gene-bold 8 cour-ital 8 bask-bold-ital 8
   to display  normal text in  GENEVA-BOLD,  underscored  text in
   monospace  COURIER-ITALIC,   bold  and   bold-italic  text  in
   BASKERVILLE-BOLD-ITALIC.

(1) This control word is treated as  a comment for output devices
    that do not support fonts.

This is  an alternate implementation  for the ".DF"  control word
that  is supported  by the  IP300,  I3820,   and QMSLASER  output
devices.

   This control word does not cause a break.   It defines a "font
name" that  will represent a set  of up to four  font identifiers
and their pointsizes.
<.B+>fontname:  <.B->A fontname may be up to twelve arbitrary characters in<.NORMAL>
   length and is  treated as if entered in uppercase.    It is by
   this name that  use of this Defined Font is  started using the
   Begin Font (.BF) control word.   The first fontname defined is
   immediately put into effect and cannot be removed.

<.B+>FONT fontid:  <.B->This parameter specifies the name of the font iden-<.NORMAL>
   tifier to  be used.    The "fontid" must  be defined  with the
   ".PH FONT" control word.   This operand  may be omitted and if
   so the "fontid" of the currently  active font will be retained
   when this  "fontname" is started  with the Begin  Font control
   word.
<.B+>CODEPAGE cp-id:  <.B->A  Codepage is a table which  maps input charac-<.NORMAL>
   ters to characters in a physical font.   A Codepage is defined
   with the ".PH CODEPAGE" control word.    If omitted,  then the
   Codepage associated with the fontid will be used,  and if that
   was not specified then the first defined "cp-id" is used.
<.B+><US|NOUS>:  <.B->Specifies that characters in  this fontname are to be<.NORMAL>
   underscored when printed.   If the output device cannot under-
   score text, this option is ignored.
<.B+><OS RPT n|OS CHAR c>:  <.B->OS RPT specifies how many times each char-<.NORMAL>
   acter is to be overstruck.   If the device supports offsetting
   of characters, it specifies the number of printer device units
   each character  is to be offset.    A value of  zero indicates
   that no overstriking is to occur.

      OS CHAR specifies  that each character is  to be overstruck
   with a particular printable character.
<.B+><v|+v|-v>:  <.B->A valid size specifies the pointsize of the character<.NORMAL>
   set to use.   A signed operand  will make a relative change in
   size to the pointsize currently in effect.
<.B+>/:  <.B->The  slash character separates  up to four  font definitions.<.NORMAL>
   The first is used for normal text,  the second for Italic text
   that is underscored  (.US)  on input.   The third  is for bold
   (.BD) text and the last for bold-italic (.BI) text.

   Resolution of the fonts to use is postponed until the fontname
is begun with the Begin Font (.BF) control word.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) This will define a user font  named "TEXT".   The normal text
    is printed  from a font identifier  "ROMAN" that has  a "STD"
    codepage to map  the input characters and the  italic text is
    printed from a  font identifier "ITAL" with  a "ASC" codepage
    to map the input.
