REMOTE defines  one or  more input lines  as a  "remote sequence"
that can  be invoked  automatically at  a specified  line on  the
output page, or under user control.

<.B+><*|n|name>:  <.B->can be a positive integer  from 1 to the Page Length<.NORMAL>
   value, or an asterisk (*),  which specifies "the first line of
   the text area",   or a positive integer greater  than the Page
   Length value but  less than 32767,  or an  identifier of eight
   characters or less.
<.B+><*|n|name> <m|SAVE|<.U+>NOSAVE<.U->>:   <.B->The input  lines between  the first<.NORMAL>
   .RM and the next  .RM are saved by SCRIPT.   The  next time an
   attempt is made to  print on line "n" of the  output page,  or
   when an Execute Macro (.EM .n) is encountered, the saved lines
   are  invoked  like a  macro  (see  .DM),  with  the  following
   possible exceptions.

      If NOSAVE  is specified as a  second operand or  assumed by
   default, the saved lines are deleted after the first use.   If
   SAVE is specified, the remote sequence is saved and invoked on
   output  line "n"  of every  column until  a ".RM n DELETE"  is
   received specifying the same line number.   If a number "m" is
   specified then the remote will  be deleted following its "m"th
   invocation.
<.B+><*|n|name> <m|SAVE|<.U+>NOSAVE<.U->> <<.U+>SAVE<.U->|NOSAVE>:  <.B->If a second operand is<.NORMAL>
   specified then  SAVE or  NOSAVE may  be specified  as a  third
   operand.   The SAVE third operand, which is default, saves the
   current page formatting options and  sets default page format-
   ting  options when  the remote  is entered  and then  restores
   these options  at the  end of  remote processing  following an
   implied break.  The NOSAVE third operand prevents current page
   formatting options  from being  maintained through  the remote
   processing and then restored at the  end of the Remote.   This
   is most useful when used with Execute Macro (.EM), allowing it
   to be used like a Local Imbed.
<.B+><*|n|name> DELETE:  <.B->deletes the specified remote.<.NORMAL>
<.B+>DELETE:  <.B->deletes  all currently-defined  remotes.   This  is also<.NORMAL>
   done automatically by SCRIPT between processing PASses.

This control word does not cause a break.  The first operand, the
name or number of the remote,   must be specified.   If the first
operand is an asterisk  "*" then the value of "n"  will be set to

the current TOP MARGIN plus one, i.e.  (<.U+>n<.U-> <.U->= TM + 1).   A numbered<.NORMAL>
Remote with a number greater than Page Length may only be invoked
with a Execute Macro (.EM)  control word.   A named Remote may be
invoked with a Execute Macro (.EM) or with a user control word of
the same name.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) <.U+>Any<.U-> <.U->lines whatever may appear  within the .RM (except another<.NORMAL>
    REMOTE ".RM") and are interpreted when the remote sequence is
    inserted.
(2) Since Remote lines  are saved away without  interpretation or
    examination,   it is  necessary  that  the terminating  ".RM"
    control word start in column one of an input line.
(3) Numbered remotes are  invoked automatically when line  "n" of
    the output  column is about to  be printed.   While  a remote
    sequence is  being used  for input,  no  other remote  may be
    automatically triggered.   If two or more remotes specify the
    same remote  name they are ordered  in a last in,   first out
    order  so  that only  the  newest  will be  triggered.    For
    numbered remotes,  they are queued first in,  first out order
    so that the oldest will be triggered first.
(4) A ".RM n DELETE"  deletes the first  sequence to  be selected
    for the specified remote identifier.
(5) You may  write your own versions  of SCRIPT control  words in
    terms  of other  control  words or  do  more checking  before
    issuing  the  intended command  by  naming  a remote  with  a
    control word.    Note that a  control word starting  with two
    control  word indicator  characters will  bypass the  initial
    search of named remotes.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) The following sequence places a figure at the top of the next
    column:
    .rm 7
    .in
       (Figure)
    .ce yes
    FIGURE ONE: Water Concentration in Lake Erie
    as a Function of GNP.
    .ce no
    .rm
(2) The following remote would define a user control word ADD:
    .rm ADD
    .sk 2;.cc 5
    .sr COUNT = &COUNT + 1
    .rm
    .ADD;.* this invokes the above remote
    .si ADD;.* this does the same
(3) Remotes defined with
    .rm NAME save nosave
    body of remote
    .rm
    are identical to macros (see .DM).
