THEN causes an input line  to be conditionally included depending
on the truth value of a previous IF control word.

This control  word does not cause  a break,  although  the "line"
may.   The "line" that begins  with the first non-blank character
after the .TH control word is processed only if the preceding .IF
was "true".  The line may include any control word except another
Then (.TH)  or an Else (.EL).   It may be another .IF,  and these
may be nested up to ten levels.  It may also be an Imbed (.IM) or
Macro Call,  in which case the current .IF status and its nesting
level will be saved and later restored when the current file nest
level is resumed.    If "line" is omitted then the  object of the
Then has no effect.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .if &sptype = page
    .   .th .pa
    .   .el .sk 2
    This example starts a new page or skips two lines,  depending
    on whether &sptype has the value "page".
(2) .if &i le 1
    .im afile
    This example will imbed file AFILE if the value of &i is less
    than  or equal  to one.    Note that  a .TH  control word  is
    assumed following a  .IF if the immediately  following record
    is not .TH or .EL.
