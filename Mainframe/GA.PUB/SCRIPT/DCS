CONDITIONAL SECTION  provides a  means of  creating a  section of
text  and/or control  words  that will  only  be included  during
SCRIPT processing under the specified condition.

<.B+><ON|OFF>:  <.B->ON  defines the  start of  a conditional  section that<.NORMAL>
   will never be processed by SCRIPT,  and OFF defines the end of
   that block.
<.B+>n <INCLUDE|IGNORE>:  <.B->"n"  specifies the number of  a conditional-<.NORMAL>
   section block (from 1 to 99)  that is either to be INCLUDEd or
   IGNOREd during SCRIPT processing.   INCLUDE is the initial and
   default state for all 99 block numbers.
<.B+>n <ON|OFF>:  <.B->ON defines the  start of a conditional-section block<.NORMAL>
   that  will  or   will  not  be  processed   depending  on  the
   INCLUDE/IGNORE  state  currently in  effect  for  "conditional
   section n" blocks.

This control word  does not cause a  break.   For each of  the 99
block numbers,   any number  of conditional  sections may  occur.
When SCRIPT  encounters the  ON  of  an un-numbered  conditional-
section  block or  of a  numbered block  for which  the state  is
IGNORE,  it  goes into a special  "read input and throw  it away"
mode until it finds the OFF of that block.
