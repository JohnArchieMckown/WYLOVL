LEADING SPACE  suppresses or allows  the printing of  blank lines
created by .SP at the top of an output column or page.

<.B+>ON:  <.B->At the start of SCRIPT processing,  .LE is ON:   blank lines<.NORMAL>
   generated by  .SP are never thrown  away if they occur  at the
   top of a column or page.    For example,  if a ".SP 10" occurs
   six lines  from the  bottom of the  page,  the  remaining four
   blank lines will be printed at the  top of the next page.   If
   the operand  is omitted  then "ON"  is assumed.    The initial
   value is also "ON".
<.B+>OFF:  <.B->causes such spaces to be thrown away at the top of a column<.NORMAL>
   or page,   even if they  occur within a  text block such  as a
   Conditional Column (.CC) or Floating Keep (.FK).

This control  word does not cause  a break.   Leading  spaces and
skips <.U+>are<.U-> <.U->allowed on the first  page of the output.   Thereafter,<.NORMAL>
blank lines  generated by  .SK are always  "thrown away"  if they
occur at the  top of a column or page.    This discussion applies
only to the  text area,  not to running top  titles or top-margin
blank lines.
