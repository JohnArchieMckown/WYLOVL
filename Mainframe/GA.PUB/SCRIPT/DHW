HYPHENATE WORD specifies conditional hyphenation break-points for
a word  that is then  formatted into  the text area  according to
those break-points.

The "text-line" operand starts one  blank after the control word.
If the "text-line" will fit on  the current output line,  it will
appear without the conditional hyphens.   Otherwise,  SCRIPT will
attempt to use  one of the conditional hyphens  as a break-point,
and the word will appear without the others.   Automatic Hyphena-
tion may be  ON or OFF at  the time this control  word is encoun-
tered.   The Hyphenation Exception Dictionary  is not affected by
this.   A compound word such  as "brother-in-law" must be entered
with double hyphens, indicating that a single hyphen must remain.
A  hyphen is  only  considered to  be a  hyphen  if preceded  and
followed by an alphabetic character.   This control word does not
cause  a  break.   If  the  operand  is  omitted,  no  action  is
performed.   If a word is  specified with no conditional hyphens,
then it  will not  be hyphenated if  automatic hyphenation  is in
effect.
