This control word does not cause  a break.   If specified with no
operand,  no  action is taken.   The  operand line is  not itself
formatted and does  not add to the  count of lines on  the output
page being formatted.  The comment line is immediately written to
the output file.   Thus if it were to occur within a paragraph or
within the BEGIN/END range of an "in-core" text block (.CC,  .FN,
etc),  the position of the comment  in the output would not agree
with its position in the input.   This would be most noticable in
multiple-column mode.   This control word  would normally be used
when  the  formatted output  is  to  be re-processed  by  another
program, an editor, or an intelligent output device.

    to be displayed because of FROM page options.
