NULL treats a line operand as input, either text or control word.

The ".  "  control word  is specified by  the control  word indi-
cator, immediately followed by one or more blanks.   Its function
is to  treat the  "line" operand  as SCRIPT  input.   The  "line"
operand starts with the first non-blank character and may be text
or another control word.

   This control word will not cause a break.   However, a control
word specified in the "line" operand  may cause a break to occur.
If the "line" operand is omitted, a blank input line is assumed.

   This  control  word has  two  uses.    The first  allows  text
followed by control  words to be entered on the  same input line.
The second  allows input  lines to  be indented  for readability.
While usually specified with a  "blank" control word,  the imple-
mentation of this control word allows  ".NU" (NUll)  to be speci-
fied.  The result is the same.

    is the same as:
       this is some text
       .sk
       and this is more.
(2) .dm TEST begin
    .if '&*1' = ''
    .   .th .do begin
    .       .fo;.sk;.cc 5
    .   .do end
    .   .el &*1
    .dm TEST end
    The NULL control word is very  useful for improving the read-
    ability of structured code.
