<.B+>line:  <.B->causes the specified "line" to be treated as text, even if<.NORMAL>
   it starts with the control word indicator.
<.B+><ON|OFF>:  <.B->If ON  is specified,  then all  subsequent input lines<.NORMAL>
   will be treated as text until a physical input line is encoun-
   tered that contains ".LI OFF" starting in column one.
<.B+><<.U+>1<.U->|n>:  <.B->causes  the next "n" input  lines to be treated  as text.<.NORMAL>

(1) An input record may begin with two occurrences of the control
    word indicator  character.   This indicates that  the control
    word which follows  always a native control word  and never a
    macro name.
(2) An input record  that begins with the  control word indicator
    character followed immediately by  a backspace character will
    always be treated as text.
(3) If the control  word indicator is followed by  a single quote
    ".'" then  any control  word separator  characters,  normally
    semi-colon ";", will be treated as any other character in the
    record.
(4) The control word  indicator is normally the  period "." char-
    acter.   It may be altered with the Define Character (.DC LI)
    control word.
