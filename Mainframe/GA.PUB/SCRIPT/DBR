BREAK forces the current partially-full  output line (if any)  to
be printed without justification (if on),   and a new output line
to be begun.

The optional  "line" operand starts  one blank after  the control
word and may be text or another control word.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) Many other  control words also cause  a Break.   No  Break is
    necessary when one of these  is present.   The description of
    each control word  indicates whether it causes  a break,  and
    summary lists are contained in other components of this docu-
    ment.
(2) A blank or tab in column one  of an input line has the effect
    of a Break  immediately before the line.    See Leading Blank
    (.LB) and Leading Tab (.LT) to control this automatic Break.
(3) If  CONCATENATE NO  is in  effect,   all lines  appear to  be
    followed by a BREAK.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) This is a text line
    .br
    followed by a .BR control word.
    produces:
    This is a text line
    followed by a .BR control word.

    Without the Break, it would print as:
    This is a text line followed by a .BR control word.
