BLANK LINE  is generated internally by  SCRIPT each time  a blank
record is encountered in an input file.

This control  word causes a  break.   Any operands  specified are
ignored.   The function  it will perform is equivalent  to a Skip
(.SK)  control word.   If some other  effect is desired for blank
input records then  you may define a macro named  "BL" to perform
whatever is required.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .dm BL /.cm/
    Once this macro has been defined, any blank lines encountered
    in the  input will cause the  BL macro to be  invoked,  which
    will  do nothing.    The  blank  input lines  will  therefore
    "vanish".
(2) .dm BL /.cc 2/.sk c/
    Each time  a blank input line  is encountered,  the  BL macro
    will  make sure  that there  are  at least  two usable  lines
    remaining in the  text area and will then  generate a "condi-
    tional skip".
