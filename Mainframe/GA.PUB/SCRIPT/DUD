subject to the actions of the control words that emphasize text.

<.B+><ON|OFF> c1 <c2  ...  >:  <.B->ON specifies the  characters (as single<.NORMAL>
   characters or  as their two-digit  hexadecimal representation)
   that are  to be automatically  emphasized in text  input lines
   being acted upon by the .BD, .BI,  .UC,  .US,  and .UP control
   words.   Conversely, OFF specifies which characters are not to
   be emphasized.
<.B+><SET|INCLUDE|IGNORE> char:  <.B->SET defines  a .UD "escape" character<.NORMAL>
   that will be  recognized in text input lines  being acted upon
   by the emphasis  control words.   The first  occurrence of the
   escape  character  within such  a  line  will "turn  off"  the
   emphasis action,   the next occurrence  in the same  line will
   "turn it on  again",  and so on  from left to right  along the
   line.  Alternatively, INCLUDE and IGNORE may be used to define
   separate escapes.    INCLUDE defines an escape  character that
   "turns  on" the  emphasizing action,   and  IGNORE defines  an
   escape character that "turns it off".  The escape character(s)
   enable selective  emphasizing of  parts of  input lines;   the
   escape character  itself is  removed from  the input  line and
   does not appear in the output.

This control  word does not cause  a break.   If no  operands are
specified,  any escape characters currently  in effect are nulli-
fied and  the characters  subject to  emphasis are  reset to  the
initial defaults.   The SET, INCLUDE,  or IGNORE operands without
an escape character nullifies the  corresponding escape.   At the
start of SCRIPT  processing,  no escape characters  are in effect
and  all  characters  except the  following  are  candidates  for
emphasis.

(1) .ud on 40 " ,

    .ud
    produces the following  result:   <.U+>By including a  ".UD ON 40"<.NORMAL>
    <.U+>before the Underscore control word,   the text and the blanks<.NORMAL>
    <.U+>between may  be underscored  and the  resulting output  lines<.NORMAL>
    <.U+>justified.   The technique of  placing underscores instead of<.NORMAL>
    <.U+>blanks between words will not allow the text to be justified.<.NORMAL>
(2) .us ,SPACE=(TRK,(1,1,1))
    produces:  ,<.U+>SPACE=<.U->(<.U+>TRK<.U->,(<.U+>1<.U->,<.U+>1<.U->,<.U+>1<.U->))<.NORMAL>
(3) .ud on ( ) ,;.ud off =

(4) .ud set !
    .us !,SPACE=(!TRK,(1,1,1)!)
    produces:  ,SPACE=(<.U+>TRK<.U->,(<.U+>1<.U->,<.U+>1<.U->,<.U+>1<.U->))<.NORMAL>
