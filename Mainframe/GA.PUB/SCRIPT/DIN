INDENT causes text to be indented with respect to the left and/or
right ends of the output line.

These indents remain in effect for all subsequent output lines,аб
until reset by the next occurrence of the .IN control word.

<.B+><<.U+>0<.U->|h|+h|-h|*>:  <.B->For the  first operand,  a value of  the form "h"<.NORMAL>
   indents the start  of all subsequent output "h"  spaces to the
   right of the start of the line.    An operand of the form "+h"
   adds "h" to the current left  indent.   An operand of the form
   "-h" subtracts  "h" from the current  left indent or  makes it
   zero if the  result is negative.   An operand of  the form "*"
   leaves the current left indent unchanged.
<.B+><<.U+>0<.U->|i|+i|-i|*>:   <.B->The second  operand specifies  a "right  indent"<.NORMAL>
   value.   A value of  the form "i" or "+i" will  move the right
   indent "i"  spaces to the right  of its current  position.   A
   value of the  form "-i" will move the right  indent "i" spaces
   to the  left of its  current position.    A value of  the form
   "0-i" will set the right indent "i"  spaces to the left end of
   the output line.   A value of  the form "*" leaves the current
   right indent unchanged.

This control word causes a break.  The initial value for the Left
and Right  Indent is zero.   Specifying  ".IN 0 0" or  ".IN" will
terminate any left and right indents currently in effect.  An .IN
will terminate  any Offset (.OF),   Indent Line (.IL)   or Undent
(.UN) currently in effect unless a first operand of "*" is speci-
fied.
