DEFINE MACRO defines  a sequence of input lines to  be invoked by
".name" as  a user-defined  control word or  as an  Execute Macro
(.EM) operand.

Such user  macros may  be used  for common  sequences of  control
words and text.  Keyword and positional parameters (&*, &*0, &*1,
etc.)  may be checked and substituted when the macro is invoked.

<.B+>name:  <.B->The user macro  is known by "name",  a one  to eight char-<.NORMAL>
   acter identifier.
<.B+>name  /line 1/line  2/.../line n/:   <.B->The "macro  body" of  "name"<.NORMAL>
   consists of  the input  lines that  are separated  by a  self-
   defining character shown in the command prototype as "/".
<.B+>name  <BEGIN|END>:   <.B->Longer  user  macros   are  defined  with  a<.NORMAL>
   "name BEGIN" at the  start and "name END" to  terminate.   The
   ".DM name END" must start in column one of the input line.
<.B+>name  DELETE:   <.B->A  user  macro   may  be  deleted  by  specifying<.NORMAL>
   "name DELETE" as an operand; "name OFF" is an alternate way to
   delete a macro.

This control word does not cause a break.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) The  invoking  of  defined  user macros  by  ".name"  can  be
    suppressed with the ".MS" (Macro Substitution)  control word.
    Invoking by ".EM .name" cannot be suppressed.
(2) The ".DM name END" operands  are verified for a  macro "name"
    that matches the ".DM name BEGIN".   ".DM" starting in column
    with no  operands will  also successfully  terminate a  macro
    definition.
(3) The user-defined macro may be invoked with a variable list of
    keyword and positional operands
      .name operand1 operand2
    that will assign to the local Set Symbols &*1, &*2, ...,  the
    value of  corresponding operands  in the  macro call.    Each
    operand may  be a  character string,   a delimited  character
    string,  or a numeric.   Numeric operands that do not consist
    entirely of digits will be treated as a character string.
      .name key1=value key2=value
    Operands that consist of a  valid Set Symbol name immediately
    followed by an equal sign will  assign the value on the right
    of the equal sign to the specified Set Symbol before invoking

    the macro.    If the Set Symbol  begins with an  asterisk the
    symbol will be local to the invoked macro.
