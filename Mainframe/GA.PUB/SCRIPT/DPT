This control word does not cause a break.   It provides an alter-
native and/or a supplement to the  .HL (Head Level)  control word
for adding  text and/or  control words  to the  table-of-contents
workareas.   The "line" operand starts one blank after the end of
the control word.   In this way leading blanks may be part of the
text added.   If the "line" operand  starts with the control word
indicator,  normally ".",   the operand line is  entered "as is".
Otherwise,  the "line"  operand is taken to be a  text input line
and is added with a tab (hex code 05) and the current output page
number appended.  If used within the BEGIN/END range of a control
word that creates  an in-core text block,  the  "line" operand is
not added  to the  table-of-contents workarea  until the  in-core
block is  being output to  the text area,   to ensure that  it is
added in  the proper  sequence and with  the proper  page number.
For  more  information,  see  the  examples  given with  the  .TC
description.
