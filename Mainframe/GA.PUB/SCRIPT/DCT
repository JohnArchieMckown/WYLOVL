CONTINUED TEXT causes the first character  of the next text input
line to be placed onto the  output line immediately following the
last character already  on the output line,   with no intervening
blank.

When concatenation is  in effect,  each new input  text record is
joined to  previous text with  an intervening blank.    Text that
occurs in a "line" operand with  this control word will be joined
to any previous text with no  intervening blank.   If no previous
text exists then  the "line" operand will be  processed as normal
text.   If concatenation (.CO)  is not  in effect then there will
never be any previous text to be immediately continued.  This can
be  contrasted with  the  Define  Character "continue"  character
(.DC CONT)  that is  used to continue a text line  with text that
follows.

   This control  word does  not cause  a break.    If it  is used
without an  operand line,  the  continuation of text  is disabled
even if the previous text was to be continued.
