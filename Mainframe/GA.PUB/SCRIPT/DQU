This control word  causes a break.   If used  without an operand,
YES is assumed.   NO causes only  a break.   YES causes immediate
termination of all input-file processing;  SCRIPT advances to the
top of  the next  page,  outputs any  in-core blocks  that remain
(footnotes, floating keeps, etc),  and then terminates input-file
processing for the current pass.
