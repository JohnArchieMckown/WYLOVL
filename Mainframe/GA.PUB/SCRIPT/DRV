READ VARIABLE allows the user to define  a value for a Set Symbol
by reading the  value from the terminal  or the next line  of the
input file.

This control word does not cause a break.  It first verifies that
"symbol" is a valid Set-Symbol variable name.

<.B+>symbol  <<.U+>TERM<.U->>:  <.B->If  TERM has  been  specified (or  if no  second<.NORMAL>
   operand was  specified),  it reads one  line of data  from the
   terminal and uses it as the right-hand side of a SET REFERENCE
   control line:
     .sr symbol = line
   No  message is  displayed at  the terminal  indicating a  READ
   VARIABLE  is being  done  (the user  may do  this  with a  .TY
   control word preceding the .RV).  If the user responds with an
   immediate Carriage Return or an  immediate Attention or Break,
   then no Set Symbol assignment is made.
<.B+>symbol FILE:  <.B->The next record in the  input stream is read and is<.NORMAL>
   used  as the  right  hand operand  of  a  SET REFERENCE  (.SR)
   control line.  If the control word is used in a file, the next
   input record of the file will  be the operand line.   However,
   if the control word is used within a Macro or Remote, the next
   input record  will be  the record  following the  line in  the
   higher-level file that invoked the Macro or Remote.  In either
   case,   the record  read  is not  processed  again when  input
   returns to  the file.   If  there are  no more records  in the
   current file then the  set symbol will be set to  null and the
   System Variable Symbol "SYSRET" is set to 4.  If that file was
   imbedded from  another file then  the next ".RV"  control word
   will read from the outer file.   When no more records exist on
   any input file  then the set symbol  will also be set  to null
   and the System Variable Symbol "SYSRET" is set to 8.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .rv test TERM
    If "NONE"  were entered  at the terminal  then this  would be
    equivalent to:
      .sr test='NONE'
(2) .rv array(1)
    If "3*99/5" were  entered at the terminal then  this would be
    equivalent to:
      .sr array(1)=3*99/5
