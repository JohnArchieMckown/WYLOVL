This control word does not cause  a break.   The initial value of
this control word is "OFF".   An omitted operand is equivalent to
"ON".  The .WD control word will cause a column eject to occur if
the first line of a multi-line paragraph  is to print on the last
line of the text area.   It will also cause a column eject before
the second-last line of  a paragraph if the last line  of a para-
graph would have appeared alone (widowed) at the top of a column.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) This control  word is still in  "under study" for  a rewrite.
    It sometimes causes a column eject one line prematurely.
(2) If a three-line paragraph would be printed with its last line
    on the next  column,  all three lines will be  ejected to the
    next column.
