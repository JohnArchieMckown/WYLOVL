OFFSET causes all  output lines after the next output  line to be
offset to the right of the current left INDENT value.

This control word  causes a break.   If no  operand is specified,
zero is assumed.    The .OF value is relative to  the left indent
defined by the last .IN control word encountered.   An operand of
the form "+h" adds the value  to the current offset.   An operand
of the  form "-h"  subtracts the value  from the  current offset.
The  offset remains  in effect  until  another .HI,   .IN or  .OF
control word is encountered.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) Consider the following input sequence:
      .OF h
      <text>
      .OF i
      <text>
    The second  offset will  be added to  the first  if "i"  is a
    signed integer.   If "i" is unsigned,  this addition will not
    occur.   Phrased differently:   if "i" is signed, all but the
    first line of the first section  together with the first line
    of the second  section will be offset "h" spaces  and all but
    the first line of the second section will be offset "h" + "i"
    spaces.
(2) An Offset following  another Offset with no  intervening text
    will override the first value.
(3) If HANGING INDENT is in effect,   an Offset control word will
    override the next time the HANGING INDENT is to be used.
(4) The System Set  Symbol &SYSOF will return  the current Offset
    value.

(1) A numbered list of points can be formatted with the following
    sequence:
        <last line of text before list>
       .in 5
       .of 4
       (1) <text>
       .of 4
       (2) <text>
          .

       .in
