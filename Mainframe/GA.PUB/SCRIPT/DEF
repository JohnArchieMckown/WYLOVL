END FILE causes immediate termination of the file currently being
processed and  resumption of the  higher-level file (if  any)  or
termination of processing (if none).

The  "file  currently being  processed"  can  be an  imbedded  or
appended file or a Macro or Remote.

<.B+><<.U+>YES<.U->|NO|CLOSE|NOCLOSE>:   <.B->If used  without  an  operand,  YES  is<.NORMAL>
   assumed, and processing of the current file is terminated.  If
   NO  is specified,   no  action  is taken.    CLOSE  terminates
   processing of the  file so that if it is  imbedded or appended
   again,  it  will be  processed from  the beginning.    NOCLOSE
   suspends processing of  the file so that if it  is imbedded or
   appended again,   processing will begin  immediately following
   the last ".EF NOCLOSE".
<.B+>SET <CLOSE|NOCLOSE>:  <.B->defines  CLOSE or NOCLOSE as  the action to<.NORMAL>
   be performed when this control word is used with no operand or
   a YES operand.   If NOCLOSE has  been "set",  then a ".EF" and
   ".EF YES" will behave as ".EF NOCLOSE".   The initial value is
   ".EF SET CLOSE".

This control  word does not  cause a break.    If .EF is  used to
terminate the highest-level  input file,  SCRIPT advances  to the
top  of  the  next  page and  prints  any  stacked  footnotes  or
"in-core" text blocks before termination of all processing.
