GOTO  transfers processing  to the  specified input  line in  the
current file or macro.

<.B+><label>:  <.B->The specified label will  be converted to uppercase and<.NORMAL>
   processing will  transfer to  the line  defined by  the corre-
   sponding SET LABEL (...) control word within the current input
   file or Macro.
<.B+><n|+n|-n>:   <.B->Alternatively,  an  absolute line  number or  signed<.NORMAL>
   relative  line number  may  be  specified.   In  either  case,
   processing will continue at the specified line.

This  control word  does not  cause  a break.    The transfer  of
control may be  forward or backward within a Macro  and within an
input file  that is  on a DASD  device (Disk),   but may  only be
forward  in an  input file  being  processed from  a Unit  Record
device (Card Reader).  If the GOTO control word is used within an
If or Nested If,  SCRIPT cannot  know where it will be positioned
in any If structure.   After a GOTO, SCRIPT will therefore assume
it is no longer in the range of any If structure.
