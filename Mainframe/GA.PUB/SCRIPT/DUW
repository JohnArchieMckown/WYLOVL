UNVERIFIED  WORD is  generated for  each input  text record  that
contains words that are not known to the Spelling Verifier.

When the SPELLCHK option has been specified,  input text is veri-
fied against words  found in a "dictionary"  of correctly spelled
words.   Any words in an input record that are found to be incor-
rect  are passed  as operands  of an  internally generated  ".UW"
control word.

   The word operands are stored  alphabetically in memory without
regard to  the case  of the  word.   The  file name  and sequence
number of the input record are stored with the word.  At termina-
tion,  the sorted list of words  with their file names and record
number references are  displayed to the error  file.   The refer-
ences are displayed with leading zeros removed and separated with
a blank.  Following the original word, possible correct spellings
are  suggested.   These  corrections  are  derived by  inserting,
deleting and exchanging letters in the problem word.

   This control word does not cause a break.   It will be treated
as a comment if the SPELLCHK  option has not been specified.   In
addition,  Spelling  Verification is only  performed on  the last
pass  of the  input so  Unverified Word  is always  treated as  a
comment for input passes other than the last.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) A ".UW" macro  could be written to trap  occurrences of miss-
    pelled words in  the input.   The macro will  be invoked with
    the misspelled words  as operands so one might  use the oper-
    ands for  a ".DU ADD" to  prevent subsequent errors  with the
    words.   A native ".UW" can be invoked from within this macro
    with Execute Macro ".EM" or "..UW".
(2) Unverified words  are maintained in working  storage.   Extra
    memory  should be  allowed for  when the  SPELLCHK option  is
    specified.
(3) The ".UW" control  word will not be generated  if the control
    word indicator character has been  disabled or for text under
    Literal control  ".LI".   Words found in  these circumstances
    are still added to the error listing.
