This control word does not cause a break.  The operands are iden-
tical to those for the APPEND control word;  see the .AP descrip-
tion for  details.   The number of  levels to which files  may be
imbedded is limited by the amount of storage available to contain
control blocks and buffers:   one file  may imbed another file or
itself, and then that file may imbed another file or itself,  and
then that file ...  this can continue until the stack of imbedded
files  becomes  so  large that  all  available  storage  contains
imbedded file control blocks and an error results.

(1) The word "imbed" does not exist in the English language.  Its
    usage  here merely  reflects the  ".IM"  control word.    The
    correct word for the function is "embed" but ".EM" was taken.
