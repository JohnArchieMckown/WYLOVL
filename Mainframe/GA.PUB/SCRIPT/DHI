HANGING  INDENT causes  all output  lines  after the  next to  be
indented the specified amount,  over  and above any existing left
indent created by the .IN control word.

This control word causes a break.   The initial and default value
is zero.   The operand may be  signed,  in which case the current
value is incremented or decremented appropriately.  The resulting
value may  never be negative or  exceed the length of  the output
line minus one (.LL  or .CL).   ON sets the value  to 0.5 inches.
OFF sets the value to zero.   Setting a hanging indent will clear
any offset  (.OF)  currently  in effect,   and vice  versa.   The
hanging indent  is automatically re-applied after  any occurrence
of  the  sequence  of  events that  also  triggers  a  "paragraph
indent"; see the .PI description for details.
