This control word causes a break.    No operand may be specified.
If this  control word  is encountered  while processing  the last
column on a page,  SCRIPT ejects to  the first column of the next
page.   Unlike the action of a  .CC (Conditional Column)  with no
operands,  a .CB will eject to the top of the next column even if
output  is already  positioned at  the  top of  a column.    This
control word is illegal in a Keep or Footnote.
