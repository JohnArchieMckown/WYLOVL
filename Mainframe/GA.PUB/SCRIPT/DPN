PAGE NUMBERING controls the setting,  incrementing and formatting
of page numbers.

This  control word  does not  cause  a break  (with the  possible
exception of NORM).   The initial and default value is ON,  which
causes page numbers to be incremented automatically and displayed
in any running title containing the Page Symbol (.PS)  character.
ARABIC  and NORM  are  also  in effect  at  the  start of  SCRIPT
processing.

<.B+>OFF:  <.B->suppresses  the display  of page  numbers in  running title<.NORMAL>
   lines.
<.B+>OFFNO:  <.B->suppresses both the displaying and automatic incrementing<.NORMAL>
   of page numbers.
<.B+>ARABIC:  <.B->causes page numbers to be displayed as Arabic numerals.<.NORMAL>
<.B+>ROMAN  <<.U+>LOWER<.U->|UPPER>:  <.B->causes  page numbers  to  be displayed  as<.NORMAL>
   lowercase or uppercase Roman numerals.
<.B+><PREFIX|SUFFIX  <string>>:  <.B->specifies  an  up-to-eight-characters<.NORMAL>
   "string" to  be displayed as  a prefix  or suffix on  the page
   number in running titles.   If no "string" is specified,  then
   it nullifies any previous prefix/suffix.
<.B+>FRAC:  <.B->causes fractional  incrementing of page numbers  to occur.<.NORMAL>
   The next page eject that goes from an even-numbered page to an
   odd-numbered page  will initiate page numbering  in increments
   of ".1" (for example, after page 4 will be pages 4.1, 4.2, and
   so on).
<.B+>NORM:  <.B->If  FRAC is  in effect,   a page  eject occurs  and normal<.NORMAL>
   integer numbering resumes.  If FRAC was not in effect, nothing
   is done.
<.B+><n|+n|-n <m|+m|-m>>:  <.B->An operand of the  form "n" will assign the<.NORMAL>
   number of the current page.  A "+n" will make the current page
   number larger by "n" and "-n" will make it smaller by "n", but
   never zero  or less.   A  second operand  of the form  "m" may
   optionally be specified  to number the pages in  a "n.m" form,
   incrementing "m" on each page instead of "n".   Thus a chapter
   or an update to be page-numbered  3,  3.1,  3.2, ...  would be
   started by specifying ".PN 3 0".

If  automatic  incrementing  is suppressed,   the  ".PA ODD"  and
".PA EVEN" control words  function exactly like .PA.    The "OFF"

and "OFFNO" operands will suppress  the default top running title
of "PAGE %";  in user-defined running top and bottom titles,  the
Page Symbol character will print as the null string.
