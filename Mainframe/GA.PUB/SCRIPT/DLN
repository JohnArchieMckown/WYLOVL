IMMEDIATE LINE positions subsequent output to start at the speci-
fied line of the text area, which may be further down the current
column or higher up on the next.

This control word causes a break.   An operand must be specified.
An operand  of "1"  specifies the  first line  following the  Top
Margin.   If a line higher in  the column than the current output
line is specified,  a "column eject"  is done first,  followed by
the required number of vertical spaces.    An operand of the form
"+n" spaces down on the current column and an operand of the form
"-n" spaces down on the next column.

   When  spacing,  numbered  Remotes are  not invoked.    Leading
spaces are allowed on a page whether  or not the .LE control word
has been specified.   This control word cannot be used within the
BEGIN/END range of any "in-core" block such as a .CC or .FN.

(1) .ln 22
    A break is caused and subsequent  output is positioned to the
    next occurrence of  line 22 in the text  area.   If currently
    above line 22,  this is accomplished by spacing down the text
    area to the 22nd line.   If currently below line 22,  this is
    accomplished by a  column eject  (a page  eject,  in  single-
    column mode)  and  then spacing down to the 22nd  line of the
    text area.
(2) .ln -5
    This ejects the current column (or  page)  and spaces to five
    lines higher than the former  position.   This would cause an
    error if  the former  position were not  at least  five lines
    down from the top margin.
