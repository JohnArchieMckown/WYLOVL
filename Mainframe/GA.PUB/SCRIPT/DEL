ELSE causes conditional processing of an input line, depending on
the truth value of a previous IF control word.

This control word does not cause  a break.   However,  a control-
word "line"  operand may.    This control word  may be  used only
immediately following  a .IF,  a  .TH or  a .TH .DO  group.   The
"line" that begins  with the first non-blank  character after the
.EL  control word  is processed  only  if the  preceding .IF  was
"false".   The line  may include any control  word except another
THEN (.TH) or ELSE (.EL).   The line may be another .IF and these
may be nested up to ten levels.  The object may be an Imbed (.IM)
or  Macro Call,   in which  case the  current IF  status and  its
nesting level will  be saved and later restored  when the current
file nest level is resumed.   When using a nested IF, the Else is
always matched to  the innermost unpaired Then.   It  may thus be
necessary to  enter an  Else with  no object  line to  define the
required branching  structure.   If  "line" is  omitted then  the
object of the .EL has no effect.
