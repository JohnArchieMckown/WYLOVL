OUTPUT OVERLAY causes  output lines to  be overlaid with  a user-
defined string.

This control word does not cause a break.

<.B+><<.U+>1<.U->|n|ON <string>>:   <.B->The following  output line,   or "n"  output<.NORMAL>
   lines,  will be  overstruck with the output  overlay "string".
   The "string"  is processed as  a No  Format input line  and is
   placed on top of the previous line.

      The "string" is defined starting  one blank after the first
   operand on the same line.   If  omitted,  the "string" will be
   the next input record.  The first operand specifies the number
   of times the  overlay operation is to be  performed.   An "ON"
   operand continues  the process  indefinitely.   More  than one
   Output Overlay "string" may be  specified.   These are printed
   in the order in  which they are defined.   If a  Skip or Space
   Conditional is  pending when the  overlay is defined  then the
   overlay will not print until after the blank lines are output.
<.B+><OFF|DELETE>:  <.B->An "OFF" operand terminates the first entry on the<.NORMAL>
   queue;  a "0" operand defines an  entry that is never used;  a
   "DELETE" operand purges  the entire queue.   An  entry that is
   deleted will  not be used  on an output  line that is  not yet
   full.   A  break may  be used  to terminate  the current  line
   before deleting the output overlay.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) to facilitate margin headers:
    .oo 1 Head One
    .oo 1
    Head Two
    .in 1.3i
    This is some text that will have a margin header
    defined in the left margin.  Those header lines
    read "Head One" and "Head Two".
    This  sequence  of  control  words   and  text  produces  the
    following result:

Head One     This is  some text  that will  have a  margin header<.NORMAL>
Head Two     defined in the left margin.  Those header lines read<.NORMAL>
             "Head One" and "Head Two".
