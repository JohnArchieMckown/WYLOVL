This control word causes  a break.   SKIPs that occur at the  top of an output
column or page will  not be printed;  this includes SKIPs at  the start of any
in-core text block that prints at the top of a column or page.

[0;1m<[1;4m1[0;1m|n>:  [0mIf used without an integer operand,  "1" will be assumed.   An operand[0m
   of zero (0) is equivalent to the .BR control word.  If the operand is minus
   one (-1),  the next input text line  will be overprinted on the last output
   line and will not count toward the number  of lines in the text area.   For
   values greater than zero, there will be "n" blank lines generated if Single
   Spacing (.SS or  .LS 0)  is in effect.    If Multiple Line Spacing  (.DS or
   .LS >0)  is in effect then "n" times  the line spacing plus one blank lines
   are generated.   For example, in Double Space mode a ".SK 2" generates four
   blank lines.
[0;1m<[1;4m1[0;1m|n> <A> <C>:  [0mThe "A" or "ABS" operand may be specified to generate only the[0m
   specified number of blank lines regardless of the current .LS value.

      The "C"  or "COND"  operand may  be specified  to define  a "conditional
   skip".   The  effect of a  conditional skip  depends on what  follows.   If
   followed by output lines generated by an SKIP or SPACE,  the result will be
   the larger of the two requests.  If either is a conditional space, then the
   result will be processed  as a SPACE and will generate  blank lines even at
   the top  of a column  or page.   If  followed by  a text output  line,  the
   "conditional skip"  line(s)  will be printed  before the text  output line.
   Conditional  skips are  also  ignored  at the  top  of  a column  or  page,
   including those that occur at the beginning of in-core blocks that print at
   the top of  a column or page.    If an in-core block  ends with conditional
   skips,  those conditional skips will be put into effect after the block has
   printed, rather than as part of the block.

When .SK -1 is used  to generate an overprint line,  the  visual appearance of
the result is dependent on whether the  output device has the ability to over-
print lines.    For output directed  to the line  printer,  and for  output to
online terminals  that have a negative  linefeed capability,  the  result will
appear properly.   For output devices that  cannot handle printing one line on
top of another the  overprint line will display on the  subsequent line,  even
though it will not add to SCRIPT's internal counting of the number of lines in
the text area for pagination purposes.
