This control word causes a break.  The operands and other consid-
erations are identical to those for the .CE control word; see the
.CE  description for  details.    Note  also that  any  "trailing
blanks" in a text operand "line" will be counted for the purposes
of right-adjusting on output.  Also, if the "line" is longer than
the length of the output line, it will be truncated.
