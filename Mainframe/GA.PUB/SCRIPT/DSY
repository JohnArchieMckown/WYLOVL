system for command processing.

This control word does not cause a break.  If no operand is spec-
ified,  no  action is  taken.   The .SY  control word  provides a
facility  for imbedding  operating-system  commands  in a  SCRIPT
file,  to be  executed each time SCRIPT is  invoked.   The System
Variable Symbol "SYSRET"  provides the return code  from the last
.SY command issued.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) Currently, this control word is supported for only the VM/CMS
    environment.   In  the OS/VS TSO  or batch  environments,  no
    action is taken.   Under CMS, only CP and CMS SUBSET commands
    may be issued.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .sy cp spool prt cont
    .if &SYSRET ne 0 .qq
    This example issues a CP command to SPool the virtual printer
    "CONTinuous".   If  the command  was not  successful,  SCRIPT
    terminates using ".qq".
