A blank is not required between the ... and the label.

<.B+>...label <line>:   <.B->Labels are used as  "target" lines for  the GO<.NORMAL>
   control word.  A label may consist of a maximum of eight char-
   acters,  and must be unique within the input file,  Macro,  or
   Remote in which it is  defined.   Labels are stored internally
   by  SCRIPT entirely  in  uppercase;   therefore,  "...hi"  and
   "... HI" are identical.
<.B+>...n <line>:   <.B->Numeric labels  are used to  verify that  the line<.NORMAL>
   really is  the "nth"  record in  the input  file,  Macro,   or
   Remote.   If the verification fails, SCRIPT generates an error
   message.

This control word does not cause  a break.   The optional text or
control-word "line",   starting one  blank after  the label,   is
processed  after  the label  field  is  scanned.   If  "line"  is
omitted, no other action is performed.   Control words within the
"line" operand may cause a break.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) ...skip .sk 2
    This defines a "SKIP" label on a "skip two" statement.
(2) ... 99 This had better be line ninety-nine.
    This verifies that  the line of text occurs in  input line 99
    of the current input file,  or results in an error message if
    not.
