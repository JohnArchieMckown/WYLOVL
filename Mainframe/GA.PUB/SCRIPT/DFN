FOOTNOTE allows you  to define the text for a  footnote that will
be printed at the  bottom of the text area.   It  also allows you
some  ability  to  control  the manner  in  which  footnotes  are
printed.

<.B+>BEGIN:  <.B->The current values of  all relevant control variables are<.NORMAL>
   saved,  and SCRIPT  goes into "single-spaced output"  mode and
   prepares to accept footnote text.  All text thereafter becomes
   part of the footnote.   Any formatting control word may appear
   within a footnote except another Footnote (.FN)  or Keep (.CC,
   .CP, .FK, .FB) control word,  a page eject (.PA),  or an Imme-
   diate Line (.LN).  Skips and spaces (.SK and .SP) in footnotes
   are normally  forced to single  space mode and  all formatting
   requests apply <.U+>only<.U-> <.U->to the footnote.Ç<.NORMAL>
<.B+>END:  <.B->The values  saved by the ".fn begin" are  then restored and<.NORMAL>
   formatting of "normal" output continues.
<.B+>THRESH <<.U+>ON<.U->|OFF|n>:  <.B->SCRIPT  has a "threshold" rule  that confines<.NORMAL>
   footnotes to  the bottom half of  the text area.    The THRESH
   operand allows you to manipulate this rule.   In the ON condi-
   tion (the initial value), the "threshold" rule is obeyed.   In
   the OFF condition, SCRIPT will use as much of the text area as
   it needs  in order  to print  any outstanding  footnote lines;
   when there are  enough outstanding footnote lines  to fill the
   entire text  area,  SCRIPT  will by-pass  the printing  of the
   footnote separator  lines and fill  the entire text  area with
   footnotes.   A numeric operand will  allow footnotes to occupy
   all but the top "n" lines of the text area.
<.B+>SET n:  <.B->define the number of lines  that are to separate the last<.NORMAL>
   line of "normal" text in the text  area from the first line of
   footnote text.  The initial value of "n" is three and "n" must
   be a numeric value from zero to thirty-two.
_____________________

Ç With the exception of the line-spacing mode, format controls in
  effect when  the ".fn begin"  is encountered  remain in  effect
  during formatting of the footnote unless explicitly overridden.
  For example, if indentation of the text has been requested with
  a .IN control word,  the footnote  will also be indented unless
  the .IN is altered within the footnote.

<.B+>SET n /s1/s2/s3:   <.B->defines line number  "n" (from one  to thirty-<.NORMAL>
   two) of the footnote separator, and the three strings that are
   to be printed on that line:   "s1" will be left-adjusted, "s2"
   will  be centered,   and "s3"  will  be right-adjusted.    The
   initial value for all separator lines  is blank except for the
   second,  which is a centered row  of dashes (-)  of length one
   third the line length.
<.B+>SUP <BEGIN|END|n>:  <.B->enables you to suppress the printing of foot-<.NORMAL>
   notes.   If SUP is followed by BEGIN,  then all footnotes that
   have not yet printed and all footnotes defined thereafter will
   not be allowed to print.   If SUP is followed by END, then all
   suppressed footnotes and all footnotes defined thereafter will
   become eligible to be printed.   If SUP  is followed by a non-
   negative integer "n",  then the  printing of footnotes will be
   suppressed for the next "n"  pages,  starting with the current
   page.

SCRIPT attempts to reserve enough room  at the bottom of the text
area to print the separator lines  and the footnotes.   If enough
room does not exist, footnotes will be continued at the bottom of
the text area of the next column or page.  This control word does
not cause a break.   An operand must be provided, as none will be
assumed.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) When ".fn begin" is encountered,  single-spacing (.ss)  is in
    effect.   The Line Spacing may be  altered and will remain in
    effect until the end of the Footnote.
(2) No more than the value of  the SCRIPT option FNSize (normally
    1000) footnote lines may be waiting for output at any time.
(3) If there are "n" footnote separator lines,  then no footnotes
    will appear  at the bottom  of the  page unless there  are at
    least n+1 lines available in the text area.  If footnotes are
    generated within n+2 lines of the bottom,  they will be saved
    for the next page.
(4) The text line that precedes a footnote definition will always
    be printed on the current page.  It can never be displaced to
    the next page by accumulation of footnotes.
(5) Footnotes appear at the bottom of  the text area,  NOT in the
    Bottom Margin area set by the ".BM" control word.
(6) See the description  under .CC for the list  of control words
    that may not be used within the BEGIN/END range.
(7) A Floating Keep (.FK)  or Conditional Page (.CP or .CC)  text
    block that prints starting at the top of a page will displace
    footnote lines  on that page if  the text block  extends down
    into the footnote area above the Bottom Margin.
(8) Footnote numbering,  as used in this manual,  is described in
    the Appendix  containing notes  on the  construction of  this
    manual.
