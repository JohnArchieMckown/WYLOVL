SPELLING VERIFICATION controls which input text is to be verified
for correct spelling if the SPELLCHK option has been specified.

All input text that  is added to the text area  of an output page
will be verified for correct spelling  of words,  if the SPELLCHK
option has been specified.   Text in  any Running Titles is never
verified.   The definition of a "word" is normally any alphabetic
character or a  single quote character embedded  within the word.
This can be changed with ".DC PUNC".

   SCRIPT has a  built-in Spelling Dictionary that  contains more
than 30,000 words.   A word is considered to be correctly spelled
if it  matches one  of the words  in this  dictionary,  or  if it
matches after  prefix and  suffix analysis.    The list  of valid
prefixes includes:
    en                         pre
    im                         re
    in                         sub
    non                        under
    over                       un
The list  of valid  suffixes includes  the following.    The data
following '/' indicates that a matching suffix is replaced before
looking up the word.   If this  replacement does not find a word,
the search continues with any other matching suffix.
(1) Possessive -- 's
(2) Plurals -- ies/y, es/e, es, s
(3) Past Tense -- ied/y, ed/e, ed
(4) Past Participles -- ying/ie, ing/e, ing
(5) Comparatives -- ier/y, er/e, er
(6) Superlatives -- iest/y, est/e, est
(7) Adverbs -- ly/e, ly
(8) Other -- ability, ation/e, ance, able, less, ness, ity,  ion,
    ize, ism, al, ic

Note,  therefore,   that non-words such  as "prerooting"  will be
accepted  by  the spelling  verifier  because  "pre" is  a  valid
prefix,  "ing" is  a valid suffix,  and  "root" is a word  in the
Spelling Dictionary.

   This control word does not cause  a break.   The initial value
for Spelling Verification  is "ON".   An omitted  operand will be
treated as "ON".

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) Spelling  Verification will  increase  the  computer time  to
    process the document.   The SPELLCHK option would normally be
    used after initial input entry  to aid with initial proofing,
    and once again before the document is printed in final form.
(2) Each time SCRIPT detects a word that is not acceptable to the
    spelling verifier,  it  adds that word to  an internal table,
    together with the name of the  file and the input-line record
    number within that file.   This information is then displayed
    at the end of SCRIPT processing.  Therefore, Spelling Verifi-
    cation will increase  the memory requirements to  process the
    document,  particularly  if the  document contains  a lot  of
    unverifiable words.
(3) The .DU (Dictionary Update)  control word  may be used to add
    additional "root"  words to the Spelling  Verifier dictionary
    for the duration of SCRIPT processing.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .SV OFF
    input text that follows is  never subject to Spelling Verifi-
    cation.
(2) .SV ON
    following input will be checked for spelling, but only if the
    SPELLCHK option has been specified.
