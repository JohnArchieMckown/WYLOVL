<.B+>ON:  <.B->When  multiple-column output is  in effect,  the  columns of<.NORMAL>
   text on a page that are not full may be balanced when a column
   or  page eject  or  column  definition occurs.    SCRIPT  will
   attempt to make the number of lines in each column as equal as
   possible.   However,  any column that  is terminated by a .CB,
   .CC, .CP,  or .PA is ineligible for balancing unless it is the
   last column on the page.   If a  Skip (.SK)  is ignored at the
   top of a column then text in previous columns are not eligible
   for balancing.   Any column that contains a footnote is ineli-
   gible for balancing.
<.B+>OFF:  <.B->No attempt is made to balance the columns.<.NORMAL>

This control  word does  not create  a break.    The initial  and
default operand is "ON".
