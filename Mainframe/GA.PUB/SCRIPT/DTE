TERMINAL INPUT reads and processes input lines from the terminal.
The lines  typed in at the  terminal may be text  or control-word
lines.

This control word does not cause a break.  However, control words
input under  its control  may cause breaks.    If the  operand is
omitted then 1 is assumed.   When the .TE control word is encoun-
tered,  "n" lines are read from  the terminal and processed as if
they had  been in the  input file.    The "ON" operand  will read
terminal  input until  terminated  by  the user.    Pressing  the
ATTENTION or BREAK key terminates the .TE,  regardless of whether
"n" lines have been input or the "ON" operand was specified.  The
.TE can also be terminated by typing a "null" line,  but the null
line will be processed as a blank input line (normally treated as
a .SK).   Since  a .TE is treated as an  imbedded file,  terminal
input may also be terminated with a .EF, .QU or .QQ control word.

<.U+>NOTES<.NORMAL>
(1) The .TE control word takes input  from the user and processes
    it as  text or control words.    Output should not be  to the
    terminal,  since user input and  SCRIPT output will be inter-
    spersed.   However,  .TE  can be used effectively  before the
    "Load paper..." message with terminal output.
(2) If output is  also to the terminal,  the  typing element will
    space but not print.ад You should manually space the carriage
    <.U+>back<.U-> <.U->one line to leave it properly aligned after the carriage<.NORMAL>
    return that ends the input line.
(3) You might  wish to  use .TE in  order to  dynamically specify
    control words or text, or change the typing element.
(4) The .RD control  word allows you to type on  the terminal but
    does not process any data entered.
(5) The input read  by this control word can be  processed from a
    disk file if the filename "SYSCONS"  is allocated to an input
    file.

<.U+>EXAMPLES<.NORMAL>
(1) .ty Enter name and address here:
    .te 4
(2) .ty Enter formatting environment and variables
    .ty and terminate with a Break or Attention:
