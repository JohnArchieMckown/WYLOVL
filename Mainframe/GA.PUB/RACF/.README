Re:  RACF PUBLIC library change

I changed the WYL.GA.PUB.RACF so that now every member will
automatically get PUBLOADed.  If you don't want something in that
library to get PUBLOADed it's name must begin with a ".".
(e.g. RACF#.INFO PUBLIC will not get PUBLOADed).

Also note that there is a member called RACF#.INIT which gets called
at initialization to set up the variables which define the commands.
Be a bit careful when modifying this exec as it gets run at Wylbur
initialization.
