-            WYLBUR was first implemented  on the IBM 360/67 at the  Campus Facility of the
             then Stanford Computation Center in 1967.   In 1970,  an MVT version of WYLBUR
             written by the National  Institutes of Health was installed on  the IBM 360/91
             at the  SLAC Facility;   there it  was the  object of  substantial development
             effort.  This extended version was then called SLAC/WYLBUR.
0            In 1973, SLAC/WYLBUR was converted to run under VS2 Release 1 (SVS) on the IBM
             370/158 at Encina Hall, Stanford Campus.  Subsequently this version of WYLBUR,
             Stanford WYLBUR, was enhanced and together with Stanford's timesharing monitor
             ORVYL and  terminal communications interface  MILTEN,  were introduced  as the
             Stanford  Timesharing System.    In 1975  the system  was upgraded  to an  IBM
             370/168,  which was converted  to an IBM 3033 in 1979.    In 1981 the Stanford
             Timesharing System  was converted to  an IBM 3081  to run under  IBM's current
             release of VS2, MVS, which was upgraded in 1983 to the current MVS/XA.
0            WYLBUR was extended considerably during these  years.   A System News facility
             was installed  in 1978,  and  in 1980 an  Electronic Mail facility  was added.
             Online  HELP was  installed  in 1981.    Other  extensions  to WYLBUR  include
             supporting the  Integrated Catalog  Facility and adding  Page mode  editing in
             1983,  integrated microcomputer  file transfer support using  a program called
             Samson and a spelling checker facility in 1984.  Now this complete interactive
             service is offered  to the users of Information Technology  Services (ITS)  on
             the current IBM 3081 system.
0            Many  enhancements  to WYLBUR  were  originally  designed and  implemented  at
             Stanford.    Included among  those who  have made  important contributions  to
             WYLBUR development are John Borgelt, Brian Cox, Michael Durket,  Roger Fajman,
             Carol Farlow, Parker Gillespie, Vicki Griffeth,  John Halperin,  Charley Hoyt,
             Bruce Hunt, Carol Lennox,  Richard Levitt,  James Nisbet,  Edwin Russell,  and
             Joseph Wells.   Additional extensions were  originally implemented at Columbia
             University and the National Institutes of Health.
0            In 1981, the fifth edition of this reference manual was completely revised and
             reorganized.  Eleanor Brown of Technical Support Services wrote and edited the
             majority  of  the  additions  and  revisions   and  was  responsible  for  the
             reorganization of  the manual.   Lincoln  Ong of Operations  Technical Support
             wrote and edited some commands, prepared three appendices, and was responsible
             for the formatting of the manual,  including the overwhelming job of preparing
             the index.   Invaluable technical assistance was provided by James Nisbet, who
             displayed amazing patience and availability.    Technical and editorial review
             comments were provided  by:   Ruth Chase,  Ronald Clemens,   June Genis,  John
             Klemm, Mark Lawrence, Shirley Melen, Anne Seeley, and James Stosick.
0            This  sixth edition  of the  reference manual  was  revised to  include a  new
             version of Page WYLBUR, the new full-screen text-editing mode.  Lincoln Ong of

-            This manual describes WYLBUR,  a computer program that is part of the IBM 3081
             computer at Information Technology Services (ITS) at Stanford.  WYLBUR acts as
             a text editor and a communicator with other parts of the system.
0            Since this is primarily a reference manual,  it provides a description of each
             WYLBUR  command,  including  details about  syntax,   function,  and  options.
             Definitions of essential system terminology are also included.  Part I gives a
             brief  overview  of  WYLBUR;   Part   II  contains  command  descriptions  and
             definitions of terminology taken from WYLBUR's online HELP facility.
0            Note that Page WYLBUR,  a recent extension to WYLBUR (as of January 1984),  is
             only briefly described in this document,  in the command descriptions of VIEW,
             SET VIEW,  SHOW VIEW,  and SET TERMINAL.    Page WYLBUR allows full screen (or
             page  mode)   editing;  the  type  of  editing  provided  by text  editors  on
             microcomputers.   The WYLBUR  User's Guide and the Page  WYLBUR Reference Card
             explain how to use Page WYLBUR.
0            This manual is intended  for current WYLBUR users who want  a review of WYLBUR
             or who  are interested in increasing  their knowledge of the  program.   Those
             with no knowledge  of WYLBUR should begin  with  « or  the 

                                            SYNTAX NOTATION
+                                           SYNTAX NOTATION
-            WYLBUR commands are described in this reference manual through explanation and
             formal syntax.  The general form of a WYLBUR command is:
0               command-word  positional-options  keyword-options; comments
0            When you issue a  WYLBUR command,  you must specify positional  options in the
             order shown, while you can specify keyword options in any order.
0            Separate all  options from  each other and  the command word  by at  least one
             separator.    Blank,  equal  sign  (=),  and  comma  (,)   are all  equivalent
             separators.
0            If you specify a character string containing  an apostrophe (')  as an option,
             you must enclose the  string in quotation marks (").   If  the string contains
             quotation marks ("),  you must enclose  it in apostrophes (').   The following
             examples of the LIST command illustrate both of these conditions:
0               LIST "John's"
0               LIST 'He said, "WYLBUR is great."'
0            Otherwise,  when using a character string as an option,  you may enclose it in
             either apostrophes or quotation marks.
0            Separate  any  comments in  a  command  from the  rest  of  the command  by  a
             semicolon.  WYLBUR ignores comments; you use them to document commands in EXEC
             files.  Note that the TO and SEND commands do not allow comments.
0            Command syntax  (the notation  used to express  the exact  form of  a command)
             follows a set of common conventions in all WYLBUR documentation.  The examples
             below,   the command  syntax for  the SET  CURRENT  command and  the SET  MAIL
             command, clarify the explanation of command syntax that follows them.
0               SET {CURRENTë*} [line-number] [EXECUTE]
0               SET MAIL [gg.uuu] [FORWARD {uuuëgg.uuu}ëNOFORWARD] ['message']
                         [collect-options] [QUIET]
-               1.  When there is  a choice among the options for  a command,  alternatives
                    are separated by the "or" symbol (ë).
0               2.  Alternatives from which you must select only one are enclosed by braces
+                                               ____
                    ({}).

0               3.  Alternatives from  which you  may select  one,  or  which you  can omit
                    entirely, are enclosed by square brackets ([]).
0               4.  Never type braces,   brackets,  and the "or"  symbol (ë)  as part  of a
                    command.  They are for syntax explanation only.
0               5.  Substitute  a value  for words  or phrases  shown in  lowercase in  the
                    command syntax.
0               6.  Type words or letters that appear in UPPERCASE in the command syntax as
                    they are shown.   (Do  not substitute a value for them.)   You can type
                    them in upper- or lowercase and some of them may be abbreviated.   (See
                    Appendix A on abbreviations.)
0               7.  Type the  following set of special  characters exactly as shown  in the
                    command syntax:
0                        apostrophe            '         period         .
                         asterisk              *         minus sign     -
                         comma                 ,         plus sign      +
                         equal sign            =         slash          /
                         parentheses          ()         number sign    #
                         quotation marks       "
0                   You may  use a  blank in place  of an  equal sign (=)   or a  comma (,)
                    (although the equal sign or comma may make a command easier to read).

+                                        INTRODUCTION TO WYLBUR
-            WYLBUR is a computer program you can use for text-editing,  job submission and
             retrieval,  and communicating  with others who have an ITS  account.   You can
             also use  WYLBUR as a  programming language,   through the combination  of the
             WYLBUR preprocessor (an expression evaluator)  and some WYLBUR commands (e.g.,
             EXECUTE, SET VALUE, READ).
0            WYLBUR's text editing  capabilities allow you to create,   edit,  search,  and
             display a variety of text including  memos,  manuals,  computer programs,  and
             data.   There are two editing modes available on WYLBUR:   Line mode (in which
             you edit text line by line)  and Page mode (in which you edit a full screen of
             text).  They are referred to as Line mode WYLBUR and Page WYLBUR respectively.
             You may use either or both, according to your preference.
0            You can use the job submission and  retrieval capabilities to submit your work
             to the batch  system for processing.   The batch system  collects requests for
             the computer to do work (in a  batch)  and processes them independently of the
             interactive (or terminal) system.
0            The MAIL system in  WYLBUR allows you to communicate with  others who who have
             ITS accounts.  You can send, receive, and store messages from your terminal.

+            1.1   WYLBUR_FEATURES
+                  ______ ________
0            To use  WYLBUR,  you issue  instructions or  commands at a  computer terminal.
             WYLBUR is easy to learn because it has an English-like command language.   For
             example,  the command CENTER 1/81 LENGTH=72 means to  center lines 1 through 8
             within a line length of 72 characters.
0            WYLBUR is also easy  to use.   If you make a typing  error,  you can backspace
             over the error and type in the correction.    You can also press the BREAK key
             to redo an entire line.
0            A feature called  command retry allows you to use  WYLBUR's editing facilities
             to correct  or edit the  last command you  issued without retyping  the entire
             command.   In  addition,  if  you forget  to give  WYLBUR all  the information
             necessary for a specific command, it prompts for the missing data.
0            WYLBUR automatically saves the text you are  working on if either the computer
             or WYLBUR malfunctions ("crashes" or "goes down") or if,  for any reason,  you
             lose your terminal connection.

0            Before you can use WYLBUR, you must open an ITS account at Account Services in
             Forsythe Hall.   You may use WYLBUR on  a public terminal (provided by ITS for
             use by all ITS account holders)  or  on a purchased or rented terminal.   Most
             public terminals  are located  in Forsythe Hall,   although there  are several
             other  public  terminal areas  on  campus.    (Call Instruction  and  Research
             Information Systems,  497-1055,   for further information.)  If  you prefer to
             rent or buy a terminal and have it installed at your work location,  call Data
             Communications,  497-0577.   Several models of both video screen and hard-copy

0            You can  use WYLBUR on  a CRT terminal  that displays your  text or data  on a
             video screen  or on  a hard-copy  terminal that  prints your  text or  data on
             paper.   Although  the keyboard  arrangement on  terminals is  similar to  the
             keyboard arrangement on typewriters,  there are certain keys that have special
             functions when using WYLBUR.

0            The RETURN key moves  the current typing position to the left  margin (as on a
             typewriter);  however,  it has additional functions  in WYLBUR.   If you press
             RETURN after typing a command,  you are  telling WYLBUR to begin executing the
             command.   Pressing  RETURN at  the end  of a  line of  text or  data you  are
             entering tells WYLBUR to  store the line and issue a line  number prompt for a
             new line.  (On some terminals, the RETURN key may be labeled ENTER.)

+            1.3.2   BACKSPACE_Key
+                    _________ ___
0            The BACKSPACE key moves  the typing position one space to  the left and erases
             whatever was in  that space from the  computer's memory.   This allows  you to
             correct typing  errors before sending  information to WYLBUR.    You backspace
             over the incorrect characters,  type the  corrections,  and retype the rest of
             the line.   Although in some cases the  characters will remain on your screen,
             WYLBUR effectively erases all the characters  that the cursor backspaces over.
             (The cursor is a  blinking underline or block that indicates  where you are in
             your text.)   The command SET  TERMINAL BACK (see  Part II,  the  SET TERMINAL
             command)  changes  the function  of the backspace  key so  that you  can enter

+            1.3.3   BREAK_Key
+                    _____ ___
0            The BREAK  key (or ATTN  key on some terminals)   has a variety  of functions.
             Since it  actually breaks the connection  with the computer briefly,   you use
             BREAK to get the computer's attention or to interrupt what it is doing.   When
             you press the BREAK key,  WYLBUR generally responds by typing three dots (...)
             or three asterisks  (***).   You can accomplish the following  by pressing the
             BREAK key:
0               · Change from  command prompting (COMMAND  mode)  to line  number prompting
                  (COLLECT mode) and vice versa.   That is, if you press BREAK as the first
                  character in response to the command  prompt,  WYLBUR prompts with a line
                  number.   Pressing the BREAK key as the  first character in response to a
                  line number prompt causes WYLBUR to prompt for a command.
0               · Change from Page mode to command prompting (COMMAND mode).   If you press
                  the BREAK  key from any  location on the Page  mode screen,  you  will be
                  returned to a COMMAND prompt.
0               · Discard a  command or  the entire  line of  text that  you are  currently
                  typing so you can begin again.
0               · Interrupt any  listing or typing  WYLBUR does  at your terminal  (such as
                  automatic NEWS or listing your active file).
0               · Stop execution of most commands.
0               · Cause an EXEC BREAK  if an EXEC file is executing.    (See the EXECUTE in
                  Part II, for a description of an EXEC BREAK.)
0               · Enter  the command  retry mode  by pressing  BREAK along  with a  special
                  character.  (See Part II, the SET MODES command, for a description of how
                  to set RETRY mode.)

                  prompts, information prompts,  and programmed prompts,  WYLBUR terminates
                  the process and issues a command prompt (see Section 1.6.1).
0               · Once you issue an EDIT or MODIFY command,  you can press BREAK along with
                  special characters to accomplish a variety of tasks.   (See Part II for a
                  description of the EDIT and MODIFY commands.)

0            The CONTROL,  DELETE,  and ESCAPE keys  have special functions in Page WYLBUR.
             To issue a command in Page mode, you press one of these three keys followed by
             another key or series of keys.  These commands are called key sequences.
0            The  CONTROL key  sequences  (Page mode  commands that  use  the CONTROL  key)
             control the movement of  the cursor (a blinking square or  underline)  in Page
             mode.   The DELETE  key sequences delete text  in Page mode.   The  ESCAPE key
             sequences move, rearrange, and format text in your screen in Page mode.
0            In  addition,  Page  WYLBUR uses  the extra  function keys  on many  different
             terminals to replace key sequences.   In some cases you only need to press one
             key  instead of  two  or three.    The  function keys  vary  from terminal  to
             terminal.  Type HELP TERMINALS for a list of supported terminals in Page mode.
             Type  HELP TERMINAL  followed by  your terminal  type  to find  out about  the
             function keys on your supported terminal.

+                  ___ __ _____
0            Once you have an  ITS account and access to a terminal,   you can establish an
             electronic  connection between  your terminal  and the  computer.   While  the
             process is simple,  it  varies somewhat depending on the type  of terminal and
             the type of communication equipment connected to the terminal.  A handout, 
                      ,  describes  in  detail  how to  establish  a
             connection between a terminal and the  computer.   It is available in Document
             Sales, Forsythe Hall.
0            Once you successfully  establish a connection,  you get  a message identifying
             the computer,  followed by several prompts (questions)  from WYLBUR so you can
             identify yourself.  This procedure is called logging on.   Once you respond to
             a prompt, press the RETURN key to actually send the information to WYLBUR.

             responses.   You  can issue  certain general  information commands  before you
             actually logon, in response to the "Account?" prompt.
0            After you respond to the logon prompts, if there are recent NEWS items, WYLBUR
             asks whether  you want to  read each one.    If you  reply YES and  then press

0            It is  possible for  two or more  people to logon  simultaneously to  the same
             account.  Note that active file recovery is only possible for the first person
             to logon to an  account.   (See Section 2.2 for an  explanation of active file
             recovery.)  When you logon to an account that allows multiple logons and it is
             already in  use,  the  following message is  displayed after  you type  in the
             account:
0               Account <gg.uuu> is already logged on.
                No ACTIVE file recovery will be possible this session.
                OK to proceed (Yes/No)?
0            If you respond YES or OK the logon sequence continues;  anything else causes a
             return to the "Account?" prompt.
0            You can request the multiple logon capability  for new or existing accounts at
             ITS  Account  Services in  Forsythe  Hall.    All  requests must  include  the

             disconnect from  the computer,   notify WYLBUR  by issuing  a LOGOFF  command.
             WYLBUR replies with various statistics about your session and then disconnects
             your terminal from the computer:

             clears  your active  file  and  logs you  off.    (See  Section 2.1.1  for  an
             explanation of the active file.)  If you respond NO to the CLEAR ACTIVE prompt
             or if  you press BREAK  at this point,  WYLBUR  aborts the LOGOFF  command and
             prompts with "Command>".   Then,  if you want to make a permanent copy of your

0            WYLBUR communicates  with you using prompts  and messages.   The  messages are
             usually self-explanatory.   The prompts may be for commands, text lines, or to
             ask for information or permission.   You, in turn, use commands to communicate
             with WYLBUR.

+            1.6.1   Prompts
+                    _______
0            WYLBUR uses four kinds of prompts:    command,  line number,  permission,  and
             information.  (You can program your own prompts using an EXEC file.   For more
             information,  see the   		  ,  available  in Document Sales,
             Forsythe Hall.)
0               · Command prompts ask for instructions; you respond to these prompts with a
                  WYLBUR  command.   The  basic  WYLBUR command  prompt  ends  in an  angle
                  bracket,  for example,  "Command>".   If SET TERMINAL UPPER is in effect,
                  the command prompt ends in a question mark, "Command?" (See Part II for a
                  description of the SET TERMINAL command.)   You can shorten both of these
                  forms of the command  prompt with the command SET TERSE.    In that case,
                  "Command>" becomes  ">" and  "Command?" becomes  "?" (See  Part II  for a
                  description of the SET TERSE command.)
0               · Line number prompts simply prompt you to enter text.   For example,  when
                  WYLBUR prompts "1.   > ",  you can respond by typing the text you want on

0                 SET TERMINAL UPPER is in effect;  in  which case,  the line number prompt
                  ends in a question mark (?).   To return to COMMAND mode,  press BREAK in
                  response to a line number prompt.
0               · Permission prompts  ask for  permission to  do something.    For example,
                  WYLBUR asks "Clear ACTIVE (Yes/No)?" when you forget to clear your active
                  file.   You can respond  YES or press BREAK to terminate  the process and
                  return to a command prompt.
0               · Information prompts ask you for some specific information.   For example,
                  WYLBUR prompts with "Account?" and "Password?" at logon.   You must enter
                  your account and password to identify yourself so you can begin using the
                  system.

+            1.6.2   Commands
+                    ________
0            You may issue commands individually or collect  them into an EXEC file.   (For
             complete  information about  EXEC files,   see  the   		   ,
             available  in  Document  Sales,   Forsythe  Hall.)   See  the  Preface  for  a
             description  of the  general  syntax for  WYLBUR  commands.    (Syntax is  the
             notation used to express the exact form of a command.)
0            WYLBUR does not begin  processing a command you issue until  you complete that
             command by pressing RETURN.   At that point,   the command may fail to execute
             because you made  a syntax error or  omitted a relevant option.    The command
             retry feature allows you  to modify the last command issued.    If you specify
             the RETRY  option with  the SET MODES  command,  you  can request  that WYLBUR
             automatically  prompt  you for  modifications  whenever  it cannot  execute  a
             command satisfactorily.    (See Part  II for  a description  of the  SET MODES
             command.)
0            When WYLBUR  issues an error  message in response to  a command that  fails to
             execute,  you can get an explanation of that message by responding to the next
             command prompt with a question mark.   For  example,  suppose you issue a LIST
             command and specify a line number that is not in your active file.
0               Command> list 50
                Line 50 not in file.
                Command> ?
                The error message "Line n not in file." or "Lines m/n not in file." is
                given when you issue a command with an explicit range option (e.g., LIST
                8/12) and the line (or lines) you specified are not in your active file.
0            There are over 100 explanations that cover most of the WYLBUR error messages.

-            When you enter text or data with WYLBUR, you use WYLBUR files.   A WYLBUR file
             is simply a collection of lines arranged in ascending order by line number.  A
             file can contain a program such as FORTRAN  or PL/I,  some text such as a memo
             or a manual,  or  even a series of WYLBUR commands.   Each line  in a file may
             contain from 0  to 235 characters;  WYLBUR  assigns a unique number  from 0 to
             99999.999 to each line.   Line numbers can have up to 3 digits to the right of
             the decimal point.

+                    ______ ____
0            The active file is a temporary file that WYLBUR holds in the computer's memory
             so that you can  make additions and alterations to it.    The maximum workable
             size  of the  active file  is  about 100,000  lines  of average  length of  65
             characters.   Most editing commands (see Chapter 4) operate only on the active
             file.
0            To make  a permanent copy of  your active file,  you  must store it on  a disk
             volume (an external storage device)  by issuing a SAVE command.   (See Part II
             for a description of  the the SAVE command.)  Once a file is  stored on a disk
             volume, it becomes a permanent, external file (also called a data set).

+                    ________ ____
0            External  files are  either sequential  data  sets or  partitioned data  sets,
             defined by how they use space.  Each sequential data set takes up a minimum of
             one track of space on a disk volume,  no matter how many lines of text or data
             you actually include in that data set.   (Currently one track is approximately
             47,000 characters on a  3380 disk;  about 700 lines or  14 textbook pages.)  A
             partitioned data  set (also  called a  library)  is  usually assigned  several
             tracks of space;   however,  it uses space more efficiently  than a sequential

0            An  EXEC  file contains  WYLBUR  commands  that WYLBUR  executes  sequentially
             (unless you  specify otherwise).   You can  include any WYLBUR command  in the
             EXEC file,  although it can only contain  about 1500 lines or 20 pages.   (See
             Part II,  SHOW  PAGES Command,  for a  description of pages.)  An  external or
             active file becomes an EXEC file when  you issue the EXECUTE command.   WYLBUR
             moves the commands in the active or external  file into the EXEC file space (a
             part of the computer's memory) and then executes those commands.  (See Part II
             for a  description of  the EXECUTE command.)   WYLBUR holds  the EXEC  file in
             memory (just as it holds the active file); you can work with it and the active
             file at the same time.
0            Prepackaged EXEC files are  available to help you perform a  variety of useful
             tasks,  such as copying  a file from disk to tape.    Appendix C describes the
             most frequently-used EXEC  files.   You can type  HELP EXEC FILES to  get this
             information online.

             2.2   ACTIVE FILE RECOVERY
+            2.2   ACTIVE_FILE_RECOVERY
+                  ______ ____ ________
0            WYLBUR recovers  your current  active file  whenever the  operating system  or
             WYLBUR fails, or the communication connection is broken.   Recovery means that
             WYLBUR  saves  and   catalogs  the  active  file  with  the   data  set  name,
             WYL.gg.uuu.ACTIVE (gg.uuu is your ITS account), and restores it as your active
             file,  the next time  you logon.   You should not save any  data sets with the
             name ACTIVE,  since WYLBUR replaces the old  data set named ACTIVE whenever it
             performs recovery.
0            Warning:  WYLBUR cannot recover your active file in the following situations.
0               · When you  reach or exceed  your space limit  (the maximum amount  of disk
                  storage  permitted   for  your  account).    Whenever   recovery  becomes
                  impossible for that reason, WYLBUR issues a warning message at logon that
                  recovery is blocked.   (Contact ITS Account  Services in Forsythe Hall to
                  change the space limit for your account.)
0               · When you logon to an account that allows multiple logons and someone else
                  is logged on to it.  If so, WYLBUR issues a warning message that recovery
                  is not  possible and asks  if you want  to continue the  logon procedure.
                  (See  Section  1.4.1  for  more information  about  accounts  that  allow
                  multiple logons.)
0               · When certain types of hardware failures occur (such as the failure of the
                  storage devices that hold active files).    This type of hardware failure
                  occurs infrequently.

0            Because you are charged  for your disk space,  managing it  well allows you to
             save more data sets without incurring  unnecessary disk storage charges.   You
             can save your  active file on a disk volume  as a sequential data set  or as a
             member  of a  partitioned  data set  (library).   (See  Section  2.1.2 for  an
             explanation of the  difference between a sequential data set  and a library.)
             The size of your  file is an important criterion for  choosing between the two
             types of data sets.   An active file of less than 300 lines should probably be
             saved in a library.   (See the ALLOCATE  command in Part II for information on
             how to set up a library.)
0            You can  keep track  of the  names of  your data  sets with  the SHOW  CATALOG
             command;  you can use the SHOW DSNAMES command  to find out the sizes of those
             data sets.    To find  out the total  amount of space  (in tracks)   that your
             account uses, issue the SHOW SPACE command.   (See Part II for descriptions of
             the SHOW CATALOG, the SHOW DSNAMES, and the SHOW SPACE commands.)

+                                            GLOBAL OPTIONS
-            Global options are options you can specify once during a WYLBUR session rather
             than for every command to which  they apply.   WYLBUR specifies default values
             for the global options (that is, they are in effect "by default"), but you can
             change them with a SET command.   For example, the default line length used by
             WYLBUR is 72 characters.   You may change this to, say,  133 characters,  with
             the SET LENGTH command.  During the rest of your terminal session, the default
             line length in any  command that includes a LENGTH option  would be 133 rather
             than 72 (unless  you override it).   For  instance,  if you issue  the command
             JUSTIFY 10/15, WYLBUR justifies lines 10 through 15 to a line length of 133.
0            You  can display  the current  value of  any of  the global  options with  the
             appropriate SHOW command.   For example, the command SHOW LENGTH, displays the
             current value of the line length.
0            The following table  summarizes some of the global options.    Each command is
             described in detail in Part II.

+                                         SUMMARY OF COMMANDS
-            This chapter provides an overview of WYLBUR by briefly describing the function
             of each  command.   (Part II  contains a  complete description of  each WYLBUR
             command.)
0            The commands described in this chapter are divided into three major functional
             areas:
0               · Editing Commands.   These commands allow you to modify and manipulate the
                  contents of the active file.
0               · Control Commands.  These commands interface with the operating system and
                  the job entry system (JES)  in  performing system functions.   They allow
                  you  to perform  a variety  of functions  like saving  your active  file,
                  getting a list of your data set names, or submitting a job to the central
                  computer.
0               · Commands relating to EXEC files, the WYLBUR preprocessor,  and the use of
                  the conditional IF command.   Some commands  relating to EXEC files (e.g.
                  LIST,  PRINT)   are included  below in  the Editing  and Control  command
                  summaries because they can  also be used to affect files  other than EXEC
                  files (the active file or an external data set).

0            This class of JES2 operator commands displays information about such things as
             output devices, execution queues, batch job status, etc.  Each command
             provides information that is presently unavailable by any other means.  The
             basic form of the command is $D{letter} where you replace {letter} with one of
             the specific set of values described below.

0            $DA             lists job information for each active job in the system, i.e.,
                             being read in, executing or printing.
0            $DD             displays the device addresses and volume serial numbers of all
                             disks and drums currently available.
0            $DF[,n]         gives the number of jobs queued for output at a specific
                             station, by forms code.  For example, $DF,21 displays the
                             information for remote station 21.  Similarly, $DF,0 displays
                             the Forsythe output queue.  If you do not specify the station
                             number, WYLBUR assumes Forsythe (station 0).
0            $DI[n]          displays information about all initiators or a specific
                             initiator:  whether it is active or not, and which job classes
                             it is handling.  For example, $DI8 displays information for
                             initiator 8.

                             $DN gives information about all currently non-active jobs
                             (i.e., awaiting execution, printing, or punching).  Other
                             options restrict the job information as follows:
0                            n            Jobs at remote station number n.

0            The account-options allow you to access information associated with an account
             other than that of the logged-on user.  To specify such an account, add the
             option ACCOUNT gg.uuu to your command  (e.g., USE DATA ACCOUNT NR.CAR).  If
             the account has the same group code as your account, USER uuu is an
             alternative.  Similarly, if the user code is the same, you may specify GROUP
             gg instead.  You may also specify both USER and GROUP instead of ACCOUNT, if
             you prefer.  Use the PUBLIC option to access data sets maintained by ITS and
             available to all users.
0            To CATALOG, RECATALOG, SAVE, SCRATCH, or UNCATALOG a data set on another
             account, you do have to supply the password.  To COPY...FROM, LIST...FROM, or
             USE data sets stored under another account, you do not need to supply the
             password if the default security status is in effect.  See  
             for a description of data set security.
0            To specify that the data set belongs to another account, you can indicate the
             account options on the command (as described above) or you can give the
             fully-qualified dsname, for example:
0                 USE CHAP2 ACCOUNT E1.DEF CLEAR
                  USE WYL.E1.DEF.CHAP2 CLEAR
0            WYLBUR uses the SET JOB options of the account you specify, unless they are
             overridden by your SET JES or other options.  Note that the account options
             are NOT valid on the PRINT command; it is impossible to PRINT on another
             account.

0            The ALIGN command allows you to format paragraphs with whatever margins or
             indentations you choose, regardless of how the text was entered.  WYLBUR
             adjusts the contents of the lines in the specified range of the active file so
             that each line contains as many words as possible but no more than the
             specified LENGTH characters.
0            When WYLBUR must move the text from one line to another during alignment, it
             splits the text at a blank (a word is never split onto two lines) and it puts
             the rearranged text together by inserting one blank between the two parts.  It
             inserts two blanks between the two parts if the first part ends in one of the
             following characters:
0                 ? : . !
0            WYLBUR renumbers that portion of the file that it aligned.
0            The JUSTIFY command performs a similar function; however, after performing the
             alignment process, WYLBUR pads the lines with blanks so that each line
             contains the exact number of specified LENGTH characters.
0            Option Descriptions
+            ___________________
0            range           specifies the upper and lower limit of the group of lines to
                             be aligned.  This option is required and must be specified
                             first.  Alignment restarts whenever nonconsecutive lines in a
                             range are encountered or when a new range is started, as in a
                             disjoint range.  (Type HELP RANGE for a description of a
                             disjoint range.)
0            LENGTH=nnn      nnn is a value of 1 to 235 characters.  Contents of lines will
                             be aligned to the specified character length.  If this option
                             is not specified, the lines will be aligned to the current
                             value of global LENGTH.  Type HELP SET LENGTH for a
                             description of length.
0            MARKER=c        c is any character.  Lines containing the marker character in
                             column 1 will remain unchanged and the alignment process will
                             be restarted with a new paragraph.  The characters:
0                               ( ) " , ' =
0                            must be in quotation marks.  Blank lines are always treated as
                             marker lines.
0            INDENT=x[[+]yë-y]
                             aligns indented material (i.e., text not beginning in column
                             1) that is ordinarily ignored if this option is not specified.

0                            x is an integer and specifies that lines that are indented x
                             spaces should be used for continuation lines of a paragraph.
                             y can be a positive or negative integer and specifies that any
                             line with ADDITIONAL indentation of y spaces should be used
                             for the first line of a paragraph.  The default value of y is
                             0.
0                            If EVEN is not specified, only text whose indentation matches
                             the INDENT values will be aligned.  Text beginning in column 1
                             has the indentation value of 0.  If the INDENT option is not
                             specified, a default value of INDENT=0 0 is used.  Examples of
                             this option are included below, following the option
                             descriptions.
0            EVEN            must be used to cause any change in the existing indentation
                             of text.  If EVEN is specified, WYLBUR ignores existing
                             indentations, aligns all non-marker lines using the
                             indentations specified or defaulted, and starts a new
                             paragraph only after a blank line, a line with the marker
                             character, or when the range is not consecutive.  An example
                             of this option is included below, following the option
                             descriptions.
0            SPACE           removes extra spaces that may have been inserted by a previous
                             JUSTIFY command.  Unless SPACE is used, extra blanks from the
                             previous justification or alignment will be kept as part of
                             the text when it is realigned.  Two blanks are always left
                             after the characters:
0                               ? : . !
0            NUMBER          causes the entire file to be renumbered after the alignment
                             process is complete.  The starting line number and the line
                             increment will both be delta.  (Type HELP DELTA for a
                             definition of delta.)  If this option is not specified, only
                             those lines in the aligned range will be renumbered.
0            list-options    LIST specifies that the line is to be listed after it is
                             aligned.  NOLIST is the default for this command.  For

             body of each paragraph 5 spaces.  EVEN is necessary because the indentation of
             the text is to be changed (i.e., the indentation for the first line of each
             paragraph (9) is different from the indentation for the body of each paragraph
             (5).  In the first example, EVEN is not necessary because the indentation is
             NOT to be changed; it is the same for both the first line and the body of each
             paragraph.

0            The ALLOCATE command creates a WYLBUR library or pre-allocates a sequential
             data set.  (Type HELP LIBRARY for a description of library.)  When you
             allocate a library, WYLBUR automatically selects a volume for it to reside on,
             if you do not specify a volume or if you have not indicated a volume with the
             SET VOLUME command.  In addition, WYLBUR catalogs the library you specify
             (enters its name and volume location in the system catalog), so that you do
             not have to include a volume name in future commands that reference that
             library.  Once you issue the ALLOCATE command to create a library, you can
             SAVE, USE, SCRATCH, and COPY...FROM members of your library.
0            A library name should follow the rules given for specifying dsnames.  (Type
             HELP DSNAME for a description of these rules.)  The member name must be 8 or
             fewer characters but it does not have to begin with a letter.
0            It is recommended that you name one of your libraries LIB.  WYLBUR assumes LIB
             as the default library name and a library named LIB is necessary to take
             advantage of a Logon EXEC file.
0            If you omit the library name when specifying a member (e.g., SAVE #DATA),
             WYLBUR assumes the library named LIB, unless you set a name with the SET
             LIBRARY command.  (Type HELP SET LIBRARY for a description of the command.)
             Whether you omit the library name or not when specifying a member, you must
             always precede the member name by a number sign (#), for example:  SAVE
             LIB#DATA or SAVE #DATA.  Once you have saved members in your library, you can
             issue the SHOW DIRECTORY command to display a list of those members.
0            In order to remove dead space and to allow additional members to be saved, you
             have to periodically CONDENSE your library.  In addition, if you try to save a
             library member in a library that needs condensing, WYLBUR asks you if you want
             to condense it.  (Type HELP CONDENSE for a description.)

0            ON volumeëTEMPORARY
                             ON volume specifies the disk volume where the data set is to
                             allocated.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)
                             TEMPORARY allows you to allocate a library on a temporary
                             volume(e.g., SCR002).  (You are not charged for data sets
                             saved on temporary volumes.  However, each morning all data
                             sets on those volumes are scratched.)  If the ON volume option
                             or TEMPORARY option is not specified, WYLBUR automatically
                             selects a permanent volume on which to allocate your library
                             or uses the volume specified with the SET VOLUME command.

                             data is 47,000 characters on a 3380 disk.)
0            BLOCKS=n        specifies the number of directory blocks to be assigned.

                             larger, will be used.  Unless you are planning to have an
                             unusually large number of members (over 150) in the library,
                             this number need not be specified.
0            SEQUENTIAL      causes a sequential data set to be allocated.  This option is
                             primarily used to reserve space for a sequential data set.
0            NOCATALOG       specifies that the data set should not be cataloged.  CATALOG
                             is the default.

                             these options.
0            output-options  allow you to restrict the effect of the ALTER command to
                             selected groups of data sets.  OUTPUT is the only valid
                             output-option when the job is awaiting execution.  However, as
                             soon as a job has begun execution, all other options may be

0            The CANCEL command immediately terminates the execution of a job.  The job is
             placed in the output queue and any output generated up to the time you issued
             the CANCEL command will be processed.  If you specify the DUMP option, and a
             SYSUDUMP or SYSABEND DD statement has been included in your job, an ABEND dump
             will be generated.  If you specify the PURGE option, execution will be
             terminated and output will not be processed.
0            When you issue a CANCEL command for a job that is not in execution, the
             command is rejected and an error message is displayed.  To terminate a job

0            The CHANGE command is primarily used for character editing (as opposed to the
             MODIFY command that is used for line editing).  It can be used to replace one
             character string with another string or integer, to shift text, to insert new
             characters, to combine partial lines, and many other tasks.  It is often the
             simplest way to change a group of lines, especially if one character string is
             to be replaced by another of a different length.  The following example
             illustrates the most basic form of the CHANGE command:
0                 CHANGE 'frog' TO 'prince'
0            changes the character string 'frog' to the character string 'prince' in the
             entire active file.  Note that, as in the example above, the character strings
             must be enclosed in quotation marks or apostrophes.
0            Option Descriptions
+            ___________________
0            C               allows you to match a character string regardless of the case
                             (upper, lower, or a mixture of upper and lower).  When you use
                             C'stringa', it does not matter whether SET TERMINAL UPLOW or
                             SET TERMINAL UPPER is in effect.
0            'stringa'       is the character string to be changed.  It must be enclosed in
                             quotation marks or apostrophes and it must contain at least
                             one character (possibly blank).  That is, the null string is
                             not permitted as a 'stringa' option on the CHANGE command.
0            X'hexadecimal string'
                             specifies the text to be changed in its hexadecimal
                             representation.  The text must be enclosed in quotation marks
                             or apostrophes.
0            p/q/f           p and q are column numbers of a line.  They restrict the
                             search for 'stringa' in columns p through q.  f specifies a
                             fence column to prevent any shifting of text in or to the
                             right of that column.  Any blanks are shifted in or out before
                             the fence column.  If any text is lost, a message is given.
                             Specifying a fence column is useful when column-dependent text
                             is being edited, as the CHANGE command normally shifts all of
                             the line to the right of the change whenever characters are
                             inserted or deleted.
0                            You may specify p, q and f in various combinations as follows:

                                     insert a blank before column 1, whereas CHANGE 1/1 TO
                                     ' ' would change column 1 to a blank.
0                            x/y     Columns x through y will be changed; text may be
                                     shifted if characters are deleted or inserted.
0                            x/y/f   Columns x through y will be changed; f is the fence
                                     column.
0                            x//f    The replacement string will be inserted before column
                                     x; f is the fence column.
0            ALL             specifies that all columns are to be changed.  This is
                             equivalent to specifying 1/235 (since WYLBUR lines contain a
                             maximum of 235 columns).
0            TO              specifies a string that is to replace 'stringa'.  The
                             replacement string need not be of the same length as 'stringa'
                             and it may consist of any number of alphabetic, numeric, or
                             alphanumeric characters.  This option can take several forms
                             indicated as follows:
0            'stringb'       specifies the replacement string.  It must be enclosed in
                             quotation marks or apostrophes.  Three types of strings should
                             be differentiated:
0                               1. alphabetic string.  For every occurrence of 'stringa' or
                                   the specified columns, this type of string is directly
                                   substituted.

-                               2. alphanumeric string.  If an increment, n, is specified,
                                   it is used as an edit pattern.  That is, the numeric
                                   portion of this string is incremented or decremented
                                   after each replacement.  If a number is the first
                                   character in the string, it will not be incremented or
                                   decremented.  If the increment is not specified, this
                                   type of string is treated as is an alphabetic string.
0                               3. numeric string.  The string may optionally contain
                                   leading zeros and blanks.  If it is to be used as an
                                   edit pattern, the increment, n, must be specified.
                                   Otherwise, the number remains constant with each use.
0            [+]numberë-number
                             specifies a positive or negative whole number to use as the
                             replacement string.  The number should not be enclosed in
                             quotes; it cannot contain leading blanks but it can contain
                             leading zeros.  If a leading plus or minus sign is included,
                             it will precede the number.
0            +në-n           specifies a whole number to use as the associated increment
                             (or decrement).  If the +n or -n is omitted from this form, +1
                             is assumed.
0            LINE            may be used when a positive or negative integer (see TO option
                             above) is specified as a replacement string.  Normally a new
                             incremented replacement string is calculated for each
                             occurrence of 'stringa'.  This option specifies that all
                             occurrences of 'stringa' in a single line are to be replaced
                             by the same incremented replacement string.
0            X'hexadecimal string'
                             specifies the replacement text in its hexadecimal
                             representation.  The text must be enclosed in quotation marks
                             or apostrophes.
0            UPPERëLOWER     UPPER specifies that the alphabetic text is to be changed to
                             uppercase.  LOWER specifies that the alphabetic text is to be
                             changed to lowercase.
0            USING s[/t]     This option is a way of designating that the replacement
                             string is to be taken from another line(s) in the active file.
                             s and t are the beginning and ending line numbers,
                             respectively, of the replacement range.  s/t may be ALL to
                             denote the entire active file.
0            COLUMNS=v[/w]   v and w refer to the beginning and ending columns,
                             respectively, of the replacement string in each line of the
                             USING range.  If the string contained in columns v/w does not
                             contain w-v+1 characters, the string will be blank filled on
                             the right to contain that many characters.  If only v is
                             specified, columns v through 235 (which may be null) are used.

0            LINE            Normally a new line is obtained for each occurrence of
                             'stringa'.  This option specifies that all occurrences of
                             'stringa' in a single line are to be replaced by the same
                             USING range.
0            REPEAT          causes WYLBUR to repeat a USING replacement range as many
                             times as necessary.
0            IN range        specifies the range of lines to be searched for the occurrence
                             of 'stringa'.  The entire file (the explicit range ALL) is the
                             default for this option.
0            list-options    LIST, the default for this command, causes the changed lines
                             to be displayed as they are changed.  Since interrupting the
                             listing interrupts the change process, NOLIST is often used on
                             this command when a large range of lines is changed.  For
                             additional list-options, type HELP LIST-OPTIONS.
0            length-options  provide an override for the global length message (established
                             with the SET LENGTH command).  If you specify NOLENGTH, the
                             warning message about excess length will not be issued (unless
                             the line is over 235 characters).  Type HELP LENGTH-OPTIONS
                             for a description of the length options.
0            MODIFYëEDIT     specifying this option allows you to MODIFY or EDIT the
                             changed line.  If you press the BREAK key on the MODS or EDITS
                             prompt, the line will not be changed.
0            VERIFY          allows you to accept or reject each changed line in the
                             specified range before it is placed into the active file.
                             WYLBUR displays the changed line and prompts you with
                             "Change (Yes/No/Modify/Edit)?".  You can make the following
                             responses:
0                               YES, Y, OK  þþ accept the changes for the line
                                NO, N       þþ rejects the changes for the line
                                MODIFY, M   þþ switch into MODIFY to allow further changes
                                EDIT, E     þþ switch into EDIT to allow further changes
0                            If you press the BREAK key, the CHANGE command is aborted; but
                             all changes made prior to the BREAK are retained.

0            Option Descriptions
+            ___________________
0            ACTIVEëTEXT     ACTIVE erases the current active file (TEXT is equivalent to
                             ACTIVE).  CLEAR is also an option of several other commands
                             like USE, LOGOFF, SAVE, etc.
0            NOWARN          when specified with the ACTIVE option, clears the active file
                             regardless of the number of changes made to the file since the
                             last USE or SAVE command.  Otherwise, WYLBUR prompts you if
                             the number of changes equals or exceeds the WARN count
                             specified with the SET MODES command.  Type HELP SET MODES

0            DEFINED         undefines all user defined commands of the logged-on user.
0            EXECUTE         clears the current EXEC file.
0            LEARNED         clears all the learned words in your private dictionary.
0            PREFIX          clears the PREFIX field that is used to form a dsname.  Type

                             for a description of prefix.
0            SCREEN          clears a CRT terminal screen.  This command only works if you
                             have a CRT terminal with a screen that can be cleared and if
                             you have issued a SET TERMINAL command to identify your
                             terminal.  Type HELP TERMINALS for a list of the supported
                             terminals and a description of how to use SET TERMINAL to
                             specify your terminal type.
0            TABS            erases the current logical tab settings.  Type HELP SET TABS
                             for a description of tab settings.
0            VALUES          resets the WYLBUR preprocessor S-, N- and W-variables to '',

0            The COLLECT command allows you to create a new active file or to add new lines
             to the current active file.  WYLBUR does not overwrite existing lines and
             interleaves lines only when you specify the MERGE option.
0            If pressing the BREAK key is the only response to a command prompt, WYLBUR
             interprets it as though you issued the COLLECT command (with no options).  You
             can avoid this interpretation of BREAK by issuing the command SET MODES
             NOATTN.  (Type HELP SET MODES ATTN NOATTN for a description of the ATTN and
             NOATTN modes.)
0            WYLBUR remembers if you were collecting at the end of the active file.  If
             another command adds lines to the end of the file and you resume collecting by
             typing COLLECT without a line number, WYLBUR will start prompting at the new
             end of the file.
0            If necessary to continue collecting, WYLBUR automatically renumbers (because
             of an existing line) lines just collected WYLBUR does not actually renumber
             the lines until you enter the next line.  Thus, if you do not want the lines
             renumbered (or if you are finished collecting lines and you do not need the
             renumbering), simply press the BREAK key (only) in response to the next line
             number prompt.  Then WYLBUR keeps the original numbering.  WYLBUR
             automatically renumbers only lines just collected; never lines before or after
             those just collected).
0            After collecting a line of text, you can type the @ sign and press the BREAK
             key to MODIFY or EDIT that line.  MODIFY or EDIT is selected based on the mode
             in effect.  (Type HELP SET MODES MODIFY EDIT for a description of the MODIFY
             and EDIT modes.)  Just typing @ and pressing the BREAK key as the only
             response to the line number prompt allows you to MODIFY or EDIT the previous
             line.  For example:

0                               2. Otherwise, collecting is a continuation of the last

                                   line collected.  In this case, the options from the
                                   previous COLLECT are used, unless specifically
                                   overridden.
0                            Remember, you can always specify COLLECT END explicitly.
0            BY increment    specifies the line increment or delta to be used.  If the
                             line-number option was specified, but BY was not, the default
                             value is chosen according to the default delta rule.  Type
                             HELP DELTA for a description of delta.
0            MERGE           allows interleaving of collected lines with existing lines.
                             Existing lines are never overwritten.  The interleaving will
                             only occur if the increment is suitable.  For example, if the
                             active file consists only of odd-numbered lines, the command
                             COLLECT 2 BY 2 MERGE will result in prompts for even-numbered
                             lines.
0            UPPERëUPLOW     when specified with COLLECT, UPPER or UPLOW provides a
                             temporary override of the session case setting.  UPLOW causes
                             WYLBUR to retain the case (upper, lower, or a mixture) of the
                             text collected.  UPPER causes WYLBUR to convert all lowercase
                             letters to uppercase as the text is collected.  (Type HELP

0            length-options  provide an override for the global length message (established
                             with the SET LENGTH command).  If you specify NOLENGTH, the
                             warning message about excess length will not be issued (unless
                             the line is over 235 characters).  Type HELP LENGTH-OPTIONS
                             for a description of the length options.
0            CLEAR           clears the active file before the new lines are collected.

                             the first line has been entered.
0            NOWARN          when specified with the CLEAR option, overrides WARN mode, the

0            The COMPARE command compares two ranges of lines in the active file beginning
             at the lines specified.  The comparison stops if the lines are not identical.
             Then, WYLBUR lists the lines and (if neither SINGLE nor NOLIST is specified),
             prompts you with:
0                 Continue (Yes/No)?
0            If you reply YES or OK, WYLBUR resumes the compare at the next lines.  (This
             is useful when a line has changed, but no lines have been inserted or
             deleted).  WYLBUR resumes the comparison with the next lines in the range,
             unless you request otherwise.  You may do so by specifying two line-numbers
             after the YES/OK.  For example:
0                 Continue (Yes/No)? ok *,next
             or...
                  Continue (Yes/No)? yes 15.1 5000.1
0            COMPARE sets the current line pointer to the line in the first range that does
             not match.  If all lines compare, the current line pointer is set to "-1".
             This makes it possible for EXEC files to determine the results of the compare.
             The following example illustrates how you might use this in an EXEC file:
0                   1.     use copy1 clear
                    2.     copy from copy2 to 50000
                    3.     compare first,50000 single nolist
                    4.     if (* eq -1) comment copy1 and copy2 are the same

0            The CONDENSE command removes the dead space in a library to allow additional
             members to be saved.  (Type HELP LIBRARY for a definition of library.)  A job
             is submitted to condense the specified library using the COMPRESS option of
             the IBM utility IEBCOPY.  A notify message is sent to your terminal when the
             CONDENSE is complete (e.g., 12:20 JOB 1234 EABCOND ENDED  CONDENSE=0).  The
             jobname of a CONDENSE job has a special form, uuuCOND (instead of the usual
             uuuggnnn), where uuu, the user code is combined with COND (e.g., EABCOND) to
             make the job easier to recognize as a CONDENSE job.  If the CONDENSE fails
             (i.e., if you get any number other than zero in the CONDENSE= portion of the
             notify message), the job is placed in OUTPUT HOLD.
0            Whenever WYLBUR cannot complete an attempted SAVE of a library member because
             of insufficient space in the data set, it prompts you with:
0                 Condense (Yes/No)?
0            To have the library condensed, type YES or OK.  After an affirmative reply,
             you may specify the BIN, ID, LIST, BLOCK, NONOTIFY, and/or HOLD options (on
             the same line).  Once the CONDENSE job is completed, you can issue your SAVE
             command again.
0            You can usually recover a "scratched" or replaced library member until your
             library is condensed.  CONDENSE should be used cautiously if you want to take
             advantage of this backup feature.

0            The COPY command duplicates all or part of the active file and puts the copied
             text at another place in the active file.  If you issue COPY without options,
             WYLBUR copies the entire active file to the end of the current active file.
             You use a special form of the COPY command (using the FROM or EXECUTE options)
             to copy all or part of an external file or the EXEC file to the active file.
0            To copy a range from one place in the active file to another and delete the

0            range           is the range of lines to be copied.  If this option is used,
                             it must be specified first.  If it is not specified, the
                             entire file will be copied.  The range will be taken from the
                             active file, unless the FROM dsname or the EXECUTE option is
                             specified.  Type HELP RANGE for a description of range.
0                            Note:  If you specify a symbolic line number with the FROM
                             dsname option, be aware that certain line numbers may not
                             exist in the external file (e.g., FIRST in an external file
                             has the value 0 and LAST the value 99999.999).
0            EXECUTE         specifies that the range of lines to be copied should come
                             from the EXEC file.
0            FROM dsname     is the name of an external file from which the specified or

-            account-options specify the account to copy a data set belonging to an
                             account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                             this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                             for a description of the account-options.
0            ON volume       indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                             located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)  If
                             this option is not specified, WYLBUR searches the system
                             catalog (an index of data sets) for the data set name and its
                             volume location.  If the data set is not cataloged, WYLBUR
                             will use the volume set with the SET VOLUME command.  (All
                             data sets are automatically cataloged when they are saved,
                             unless you specify otherwise.)
0            format-options  allow you to specify the record length and the treatment of
                             WYLBUR line numbers in the external file.  The format-options
                             NUMBERED, UNNUMBERED, and INTEGER apply only to COPY FROM;
                             they do not apply to COPY.  Type HELP FORMAT-OPTIONS for a
                             description of the format-options.
0            TO line-number  specifies the beginning line number in the active file to
                             which the range of lines is to be copied.  If TO is omitted,
                             TO END is the default.
0            BY increment    is the line number increment, or delta, by which the
                             successive line numbers of the copied range are incremented.
                             If not specified, the default value is selected.  (Type HELP
                             DELTA for a description of delta.)  If the value of delta,
                             specified or default, would cause the copied lines to
                             interleave existing lines in the file, WYLBUR automatically
                             calculates a new value of delta so that interleaving does not
                             take place.  (See the MERGE and COMBINE options for
                             exceptions.)
0            MERGE           allows interleaving þþ but no replacement þþ of the copied
                             lines with the existing lines.  The copied lines will not
                             retain their original line numbers.
0            PLUS [-]n       specifies a positive or negative number to be added to each
                             line number of the range to be copied.  (PLUS implies MERGE.)
0            COMBINE         allows the copied range of lines to retain the original line
                             numbers.  Thus it can be used to combine several files while
                             retaining a separate numbering system for each.  This implies
                             MERGE, but MERGE need not be specified.  For example, with the
                             command COPY 3/5 FROM #FILE1 COMBINE, and an active file that
                             contains lines 1, 2, and 10, the copied lines will be copied
                             after line number 2 and before line number 10 in the active
                             file.  The copied lines will retain their original numbers,
                             i.e., 3, 4, 5.
0            REPLACE         specifies that the copied lines can replace and/or interleave
                             existing lines.  WYLBUR will not change the increment when

             CURRENT (line-number)                                  WYLBUR Reference Manual
0            CURRENT is a symbolic line number; that is, a changing pointer to lines in an
             active or EXEC file.  It is the number of the last line edited in the active
             file or the last line executed in the EXEC file.  When a line has been edited,
             it means that you have issued an editing command such as one of the following:
             ALIGN, CENTER, CHANGE, COLLECT, COPY, DELETE, EDIT, INSERT, JUSTIFY, MODIFY,
             MOVE, NUMBER, POINT, or REPLACE.
0            The LIST command does not set or change the value of CURRENT.  The USE command
             causes CURRENT to have no value.  Sometimes the value of CURRENT is not reset,
             as for example, if you specify a void range in an editing command.  The
             symbolic line numbers PREVIOUS and NEXT are dependent on CURRENT and some
             obvious restrictions apply.  For instance, if the value of CURRENT is the last
             line number in the file, there is no NEXT.
0            The symbol * as a line number is equivalent to CURRENT.  You may use either as
             the pointer to the CURRENT line number.  However, * also has other meanings in
             WYLBUR depending on the context in which you use it.   For example, when you
             specify a dsname, * refers to the currently set prefix (see SET PREFIX).  The
             value of * is assumed to refer to a line number in the active file except when
             you specify EXEC file line numbers in commands such as  EXECUTE, LIST EXECUTE,
             PUNCH EXECUTE, PRINT EXECUTE, and COPY EXECUTE.  The commands SET *, SHOW *,
             and POINT * are associated with the symbolic line number CURRENT; you may use
             them to display or change the value of it.
0            The SET CURRENT command sets the value of CURRENT; the SHOW CURRENT command
             displays the value of CURRENT.  Type HELP SET CURRENT and HELP SHOW CURRENT
             for a description of these commands.

0            The DEFINE command lets you define your own commands or redefine existing
             system commands.  These user-defined commands are valid for the duration of
             your terminal session.  (You can include them in your Logon EXEC file.)
             Before WYLBUR executes the command it substitutes the replacement text
             (usually a system command) for your user-defined command.  If automatic
             command retry is in effect, WYLBUR displays the substituted command for you to
             modify.  (Type HELP SET MODES RETRY for a description of RETRY mode.)
0            The following examples illustrate the DEFINE command:
0                 DEFINE BYE AS 'LOGOFF CLEAR'
                  DEFINE SPI AS 'CALL SPIRES'
                  DEFINE MS AS MODIFY APPEND ' SINGLE NOLIST'
0            The SHOW DEFINED command displays all your user-defined commands, UNDEFINE can
             be used to remove a specific user-defined command, and CLEAR DEFINED will
             undefine all your user-defined commands.

0            user-command    specifies the command name to be defined.  If it is longer
                             than eight characters, only the first eight characters are
                             saved and only the first eight characters need be used to
                             reference the command.
0            AS 'replacement text'
                             specifies text (usually a system command) that is to replace
                             the "user-command" (the user-defined command).  You must
                             enclose the replacement text in quotation marks or
                             apostrophes, if it is more than one word (including required
                             blanks).
0            APPEND 'append text'
                             specifies text that is to be appended to the end of the
                             command after any user-supplied values.  For example, if you
                             issue the following command:
0                               DEFINE DOC AS 'USE DOC#' APPEND ' PUBLIC'
0                            You can then issue the command DOC WYLBUR and WYLBUR changes
                             it to USE DOC#WYLBUR PUBLIC.  You must enclose the append text
                             in quotation marks or apostrophes, if it is more than one word
                             (including required blanks).
0            ABBREVIATE      specifies that the "user-command" (the user-defined command)
                             can be abbreviated to the first three or more characters.

0            The DELETE command removes the specified range of lines from the active file.
0            The short form of the DELETE command consists of responding to the command
             prompt by typing in a single line number, immediately followed by pressing the
             RETURN key.  When NOSHORT mode is in effect, WYLBUR accepts this short form
             only after a permission prompt.  (Type HELP SET MODES for a description of the
             NOSHORT and SHORT modes.)  Note that the normal abbreviation of L and F for

             Delta                                                  WYLBUR Reference Manual
0            Delta is the line number increment WYLBUR uses to determine line numbers.
             Although it may be any number between .001 and 99999.999 inclusively, delta
             has a default value of 1.000.
0            The SET DELTA command allows you to change the default value of delta; the
             SHOW DELTA command displays the current value.
0            WYLBUR determines the delta, or line increment, in either of two ways:
0               1. If the line number to be incremented is an integer or a symbolic line
                   number WYLBUR uses the the default delta, unless you have changed it
                   with the SET DELTA command.  (Type HELP LINE-NUMBER for a description
                   of symbolic line number.)
0               2. If the line number to be incremented is a decimal number, WYLBUR uses a
                   1 in the low-order decimal position as the increment.  For example, if
                   the line number is 50.023, the increment would be .001; for line number
                   198.3 the line increment would be .1.
0            If you specify a line number increment (or decrement) in a command, WYLBUR
             uses it to determine delta in the same way as the default delta, that is:
0               1. If the line number increment is an integer (e.g., if you issue a command
                   such as COLLECT FIRST+2), WYLBUR uses the default delta, unless you have
                   changed it with the SET DELTA command.
0               2. If the line number increment is a decimal number, WYLBUR uses a 1 in the
                   low-order position.  For example, if you issue the comand COLLECT
                   FIRST+2.01, WYLBUR would use a default delta of .01.

             Dsname                                                 WYLBUR Reference Manual
0            All data sets saved on a disk volume must have a dsname (data set name) of the
             form:
0                  WYL.gg.uuu.name
0            gg.uuu          is your account; gg is the two-character group code and uuu is
                             the three-character user code.
0            name            is the name by which you refer to the data set.
0            How to Specify a Dsname
+            _______________________
0            In commands that require a dsname (e.g. SAVE, USE), you seldom need to specify
             the fully-qualified form of a WYLBUR data set (WYL.gg.uuu.name), since WYLBUR
             will construct all or part of the name from default or preset values.  (HELP
             SET ACCOUNT and HELP SET PREFIX for a description of default values and how to
             change them.)  Normally, you only have to specify "name" (i.e., SAVE BALLAD not
             SAVE WYL.NR.NCR.BALLAD).  The "name" you decide on should conform to OS data
             set naming conventions as follows:
0               - It can only contain the characters 0-9, A-Z, or a national character ($,
                      #, and @)
0               - First character must be alphabetic or a national character
0               - It can not exceed eight characters, unless the characters are separated
                  by a period (.).  When separated by periods, the name can consist of up
                  to 33 characters with no more than eight between the periods (the periods
                  count as characters).  However, the first character after each period
                  must be an alphabetic or national character.
0            For example, LONGFILENAME and 4CLASS are both invalid OS data set names.
0            It is possible to specify a non-standard dsname; however, the name must be
             enclosed in apostrophes.  The case of the text inside the apostrophes IS
             significant (e.g., '4CLASS' is NOT the same as '4class').  The use of
             non-standard dsnames is not recommended since these data sets are more
             difficult to access from the batch (OS) system; for example, the BACKUP
             utility cannot copy them to tape.
0            As mentioned above, WYLBUR normally prefixes the names you specify with
             WYL.gg.uuu (where WYLBUR replaces gg.uuu with your account), unless the name
             begins with "WYL." or "SYSn".  WYLBUR recognizes such names as already
             fully-qualified.  Many system disk files, including some available for public
             use, begin with SYSn.  In addition, the dsname can be prefixed with $ to
             indicate that it is fully-qualified.

0            How to Specify a Member of a Library
+            ____________________________________
0            There are two special forms of dsnames used when specifying library members:
0                 WYL.gg.uuu.libname(member)
                  WYL.gg.uuu.libname#member
0            These two forms are equivalent in WYLBUR, but you must use the first form,
             with parentheses, when accessing a library member from a batch job.  As usual,
             WYLBUR supplies WYL.gg.uuu., if you omit it.  The library name should conform
             to the data set naming conventions described above, except that it cannot
             exceed eight characters.  The member name must be 8 or fewer characters but it
             may include special characters and need not begin with a letter.  If you omit
             the library name (e.g. SAVE #DATA), WYLBUR assumes the library named LIB or
             whatever name is set in the SET LIBRARY command.  (Type HELP LIBRARY for a
             definition of library and member.)
0            Using * as a Dsname
+            ___________________
0            Whenever you specify a data set in a USE command (e.g., USE MEMO), WYLBUR
             remembers the dsname.  Then after editing the data set, you can replace the
             original data set with the revised version by using * in place of a dsname
             (e.g., SAVE * REPLACE); WYLBUR supplies the retained dsname.  You can use * as
             a dsname on essentially any command that refers to a dsname.
0            You can also use the SET PREFIX command to establish the value of * as a data
             set name.  When you change the value of the dsname with the SET PREFIX command
             and then you specify * (e.g., SAVE *), you are indicating that, when
             constructing the dsname, WYLBUR should use the prefix you set.  PREFIX (and *)
             refer to the complete data set name of the last data set that was used or to
             the last PREFIX that was set.  The PREFIX is erased whenever the active file
             is cleared.
0            You can also set the dsname by specifying the SET option on any command that
             includes a dsname option (e.g., SAVE LIB#MEMO SET).  You can only change the
             "name" portion (e.g., LIB#MEMO) with the SET option; not the group and user
             fields (gg.uuu).  (Use the SET PREFIX or SET ACCOUNT commands to alter the
             group and user fields.)  SET is the default for the USE command.  When you
             specify the NOSET option with the USE command, WYLBUR does NOT set the dsname
             you specify as a PREFIX and it erases any previously set dsname.

0            The DUMP command allows you to put the response from any SHOW command into
             your active file.  For example, DUMP DSNAMES (instead of SHOW DSNAMES) places
             all your data set names at the end of your active file.  WYLBUR always places
             the response to a DUMP command at the end of your active file.
0            You can add the collect-options to SHOW commands to provide the same
             capability.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for a description of these options.

0            The EDIT command allows you to make multiple changes to a line or range of
             lines.  Unlike MODIFY, EDIT consists of character for character replacement;
             thus, you cannot insert or delete a character without replacing characters in
             the line.
0            WYLBUR always lists the line to be edited first.  Then it prompts you with
             "Edits >  ".  In response, space over and type in the replacement characters
             directly underneath the characters to be replaced.  To replace a character
             with a blank, you must type a vertical bar (ë).  If you type a vertical bar
             under a blank, WYLBUR inserts a vertical bar.  Signal the end of your
             alterations by pressing the RETURN key.  WYLBUR types the edited line for
             inspection (unless you specify NOLIST) and prompts for more alterations to the
             line (unless you specify SINGLE).  If you press the BREAK key, the alteration
             process stops and the line being edited remains unchanged.
0            EDIT Characters
+            _______________
0            There are several characters that provide special functions when you type one
             of them as the first character in response to the Edits prompt.  They are as
             follows:
0            L     Typing L (for LIST), as the first character in response to the Edits
                   prompt, specifies that the corrected line should be listed.  LIST is the
                   default list-option for this command.  (See the description of
                   list-options below for an explanation.)
0            M     Typing M (for MODIFY), as the first character in response to the Edits
                   prompt, allows you to alter the remainder of the line with modify
                   characters.
0            N     Typing N (for NOLIST), as the first character in response to the Edits
                   prompt, specifies that the corrected line should not be listed.  NOLIST
                   is also an option of the EDIT command.  (See the description of the
                   list-options below for an explanation.)
0            ?     Typing a question mark (?), as the first character in response to the
                   Edits prompt, gives you a description of some of the appropriate
                   responses to this prompt.
0            Line-Oriented Functions
+            _______________________
0            You can enter a line-oriented function in response to the Edits prompt; you
             must precede it by a period and enter it beginning in column 0 (i.e., the
             position of the cursor after the Edits prompt).  The available line-oriented
             functions are listed below.

0               .COLLECT    causes a prompt for new lines after the line being edited.
                (or .C)     Collecting new lines implies the acceptance of the editing
                            changes to the current line.
0               .DELETE     deletes the line.
                (or .D)
0               .INSERT     causes a prompt for a new line after the line being edited.
                (or .I)     Inserting a new line implies the acceptance of the editing
                            changes to the current line.
0               .JOIN       appends the next line to the line currently being edited.
                (or .J)
0               .LINE n     accepts editing changes to the current line and then begins the
                            editing process for the line indicated.
0               .MODIFY     accepts the editing changes to the current line and then
                (or .M)     switches to MODIFY mode.
0               .NEXT       accepts editing changes to the current line and then begins
                            the editing process for the next line.
0               .PREVIOUS   accepts editing changes to the current line and then begins
                            the editing process for the previous line.
0               .REPLACE    replaces the entire line.  A line prompt for the
                (or .R)     replacement will follow.
0               .REVERT     returns the line to its original state (i.e., before any
                            modifications were made).
0               .SKIP       ignores editing changes to the current line and the editing
                            process proceeds with the next line in the range.
0               .STOP       terminates the entire command.  Any editing changes to the
                            current line are ignored.
0            BREAK Key
+            _________
0            In the EDIT and MODIFY commands, BREAK is a special key that, when used with
             other keys, allows processing of the line being edited just as pressing the
             RETURN key does.  This is unlike the use of the BREAK key in other WYLBUR
             commands.  The following summarizes the use of the BREAK key with both the
             EDIT and the MODIFY commands:
0               1. (BREAK):  when pressed as the first character in response to the Edits
                   or Mods prompt, aborts the command and leaves the line currently being
                   edited unchanged.  However, remember that when you press BREAK in
                   response to the Edits or Mods prompt AFTER you have typed other
                   characters (including blanks), the typed line is canceled and WYLBUR
                   prompts again for the line being edited.  Lines already terminated by
                   pressing the RETURN key are not affected when the BREAK key is pressed.

                   mode.
0            Option Descriptions
+            ___________________
0            range           is the range of lines to be edited.  If specified, it must be
                             the first option.  If this option is not specified, the entire
                             file is assumed.  Type HELP RANGE for a description of range.
0            COLUMNS=m[/n]   restricts the editing to the columns specified.  When n is
                             specified, editing take place from column m to the end of the
                             line.  m/n gives a specific number of columns to be modified.
                             When text is deleted, blanks are inserted at the ending column
                             and any text past the last column specified will be lost (a
                             message to that effect will be displayed at your terminal).
0            SINGLE          causes WYLBUR to prompt you for the alteration of a line only
                             once instead of continuing to prompt you until you press the
                             RETURN key as the first character of the line.
0            UPPERëUPLOW     when specified with EDIT, UPPER or UPLOW provides a temporary
                             override of the session case setting.  UPLOW causes WYLBUR to
                             retain the case (upper, lower, or a mixture) of the text as it
                             is edited.  UPPER causes WYLBUR to convert all lowercase
                             letters to uppercase as the text is edited.  (Type HELP
                             SET TERMINAL CASE for a description of case settings.)
0            list-options    LIST, the default for this command, lists the corrected line;
                             this option can be suppressed by specifying NOLIST.  For
                             additional list-options, type HELP LIST-OPTIONS.  See the
                             description of the EDIT characters above for another way to
                             specify LIST and NOLIST.
0            length-options  override the global length parameter (established with the SET
                             LENGTH command).  If you specify NOLENGTH, the warning message
                             about excess length will not be issued (unless the line is
                             over 235 characters).  Type HELP LENGTH-OPTIONS for a
                             description of the length-options.

0            The ELSE command is executed only when relational value of the most recently

             END (line-number)                                      WYLBUR Reference Manual
0            END is a symbolic line number that represents the line number after the
             symbolic line number LAST (i.e., the last line of the file).  The value of END
             is the first line number greater than LAST that is a multiple of delta.  Thus,
             if the last line number is 10 or 10.1, 10.2, etc., and delta is 1, the value
             of END is 11.  This does not mean that line 11 exists, but rather that the
             line number of the next line WYLBUR adds at the end of the file would be 11.
             If the active file is empty, END has the value of delta.  Type HELP DELTA for
             a description of delta.

0            The EXECUTE command executes a series of WYLBUR commands.  You can indicate
             your active file or an external disk file as the source of the commands to be
             executed.  Then, WYLBUR copies the contents of the file you specified into the
             EXEC file space for execution.  If you specify neither, WYLBUR executes the
             commands that are currently in the EXEC file space (also called the EXEC
             file).  When you indicate an external file in the EXECUTE command, your active
             file is not affected.  If you indicate all or part of your active file, WYLBUR
             deletes the active file or the indicated portion, unless you specify NODELETE.
0            WYLBUR executes the commands sequentially unless a branch command (i.e.,
             EXECUTE line-number) is specified.  Execution of commands continues until one
             of the following occurs:  the end of the file is reached, an EXEC BREAK
             occurs, or an EXECUTE command with the PAUSE option is executed from the file.
0            An EXEC BREAK occurs when a command being executed in the EXEC file is aborted
             for any reason (e.g., you pressed the BREAK key or the command was incorrectly
             specified).  You can type EXECUTE NEXT or simply EXECUTE to continue executing
             the command immediately following the command that caused the EXEC BREAK.  To
             continue by re-executing the interrupted command, type the command EXECUTE
             CURRENT.
0            A pointer is maintained to the currently executing line in the EXEC file.
             This pointer is distinct from the pointer to the CURRENT line number in the
             active file.  The command SHOW CURRENT EXECUTE returns the value of the
             pointer to the CURRENT line in the EXEC file.

0            [START=]line-number
                             specifies the line number where execution should begin.  The
                             word START is optional.  If the line number does not exist,
                             WYLBUR begins execution at the next line encountered.  If this
                             option is omitted and either the ACTIVE or FROM dsname option
                             is specified, execution begins at the first line in the file.
                             If neither this option nor a file is specified, WYLBUR begins
                             execution at the symbolic line number NEXT of the file loaded
                             in the EXEC file space.
0            RETURN          causes the EXEC file to branch to the line number RETURN that
                             was set by either an EXECUTE SAVE or a SET RETURN command.
0            SAVE            specifies that the symbolic line number RETURN should be set
                             to the line number of the next line of the EXEC file.  This

             EXECUTE Command                                        WYLBUR Reference Manual
0                            provides a branch and link capability within an EXEC file or a
                             set of EXEC files.  To illustrate the use of RETURN and SAVE,
                             assume an EXEC file contains the command EXECUTE SAVE at line
                             11.  This causes the symbolic line number RETURN to be set to
                             the next line; let's assume 12.  Further, assume the command
                             EXECUTE RETURN is at line 20.  This would cause the command at
                             the line number RETURN, i.e., line 12, to be executed.
0            ACTIVE          specifies that the EXEC file space should be loaded from the
                             active file.  If neither ACTIVE nor FROM dsname is specified,
                             the current EXEC file is assumed.
0            NODELETE        prevents the active file, or the specified portion of it, from
                             being deleted after it has been loaded into the EXEC file
                             space.
0            FROM dsname     specifies that the EXEC file is to be loaded from an external
                             file.  If neither ACTIVE nor FROM dsname is specified, the
                             current EXEC file is assumed.  Type HELP DSNAME for a
                             description of dsname.
0            account-options specify the account to execute commands from an external disk
                             file belonging to an account other than that of the logged-on
                             user.  One form of this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP
                             ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a description of the account-options.
0            ON volume       indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                             located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)  If
                             this option is not specified, the volume set with the SET
                             VOLUME command will be searched; if no volume is set, the
                             system catalog, an index of data sets, will be searched for
                             the data set name and volume location.  (All data sets are
                             automatically cataloged when they are saved, unless you
                             specify otherwise.)
0            format-options  allow you to specify the record length and the treatment of
                             WYLBUR line numbers of the data set being loaded.  Type HELP
                             FORMAT-OPTIONS for a description of these options.
0            LINES=range     specifies the range of lines in the active or external file to
                             be loaded into the EXEC file space.  Either the ACTIVE or FROM
                             dsname option must be used with this option.  If ACTIVE is
                             used, the range will be deleted from the active file once it
                             is loaded unless NODELETE is also specified.  If a disjoint
                             explicit range is given, it must be in ascending order.  Type
                             HELP RANGE for a description of range.  Note that when
                             referring to an external file, the symbolic line numbers FIRST
                             and LAST have the values 0 and 99999.999 respectively.  Thus,
                             LINES=FIRST/LAST for an external file would mean
                             LINES=0/99999.999.
0            PARM={'text'ë"text"ë(text)}ëNOPARM
                             PARM sets the parameter field.  For example, the command
                             EXECUTE FROM #FIND PARM='SAMPLE' will set the PARM variable to
0                                                - 81 -

             EXECUTE Command                                        WYLBUR Reference Manual
0                            "sample".  If PARM is omitted on either EXECUTE FROM or
                             EXECUTE ACTIVE the PARM variable is set to null.  On all other
                             types of EXECUTE commands the value of PARM remains unchanged
                             unless a PARM is explicitly stated.  For example, the command
                             EXECUTE FROM #TEST will reset PARM to null, but EXECUTE 13
                             will leave PARM unchanged.  A NOPARM option can be used on
                             EXECUTE FROM or EXECUTE ACTIVE to override the default null
                             parameter and leave PARM unchanged.  For example, the command
                             EXECUTE FROM #LIBLIST PUBLIC NOPARM will not change the PARM
                             value (convenient for EXEC files that call other EXEC files).
0            PAUSE           interrupts the execution of the EXEC file; control is returned
                             to you and no commands are executed from the file.  You can
                             continue execution by typing EXECUTE.
0            CLEAR           clears the EXEC file space.  You use CLEAR with ACTIVE or FROM
                             dsname to avoid a prompt to clear the EXEC file space before
                             the new file is loaded.
0            TERSEëVERBOSE   TERSE, the logon default, specifies that the informational
                             messages issued by some commands (e.g., NUMBER, CHANGE, SAVE)
                             are not to be listed.  If NOLOG is in effect, it also keeps
                             EXECUTE commands and commands that include the ESCAPE
                             character from being listed.  VERBOSE causes such messages and
                             and commands to be listed.
0            LOGëNOLOG       LOG specifies that all commands should be listed before
                             execution.  NOLOG, the logon default, suppresses the listing
                             of commands before execution.  EXECUTE commands in the EXEC
                             file are still listed in NOLOG mode, unless TERSE is in
                             effect.

                             referred to by number, MULTIPLE is not necessary.
0            account-options specify the account to fetch a job or jobs belonging to an
                             account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                             this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS

0            queue-options   allow further selection of jobs to be affected by the command.
                             Jobs must be in the specified queue (i.e., EXEC or OUTPUT) to
                             be affected.  Type HELP QUEUE-OPTIONS for a description of
                             these options.
0            SETUP           specifies that only the JOB and SETUP statements are to be

0            MSGëNOMSG       indicates whether or not both the JES2 job log and JCL data
                             sets are to be fetched.  MSG is equivalent to LOG JCL and
                             NOMSG to NOLOG NOJCL.
0            LOGëNOLOG       indicates whether or not the JES2 job log is to be fetched.
                             The log contains job status and resource usage messages
                             including the job's charges.
0            JCLëNOJCL       indicates whether or not the JCL is to be fetched.  This
                             includes input JCL, PROC expansion, and JCL-related messages.
                             When the job is awaiting execution, JCL means the JCL as
                             submitted; NOJCL has no meaning.  When the job is awaiting
                             output processing, JCL means the JCL and system message data
                             set.
0            STEP stepname[.procstepname]
                             allows you to sepcify output by individual step.

                             allows you to specify output by individual SYSOUT data set.
0            CCëMC           CC specifies that the ANSI carriage control characters are to
                             be retained (in column 1) in the active file.  MC specifies
                             that the machine control characters of the spooled data set
                             are to be retained (in column 1) in the active file.
0            SKIP=n          n is any integer value.  n lines will be skipped and the
                             output retrieved will start at line n+1.  This option is
                             especially helpful if the output is too large to fit in the
                             active file.  You may process the part fetched and later
                             retrieve the rest using SKIP.
0            COUNT=m         m specifies the number of lines to be fetched.  For example:
0                               FETCH jobid COUNT=50
0                            would put the first 50 lines of the job's output into the
                             active file.  FETCH jobid SKIP=30 COUNT=20 would fetch the
                             31st through the 50th line.
0            DISPLAY         lists the output from a job at your terminal without putting
                             it in your active file.  If DISPLAY and CLEAR are both
                             specified, CLEAR is ignored.
0            SQUASH          reduces multiple blanks to a single blank when fetched output
                             is displayed at your terminal with the DISPLAY option.

0            TO line-number  specifies the beginning line number in the active file to
                             which the range of lines is to be copied.  Note that the
                             active file is always cleared first.
0            BY increment    is the line number increment, or delta, by which the
                             successive line numbers of the fetched range are incremented.
                             If not specified, the default value is selected.  (Type HELP
                             DELTA for a description of delta.)
0            CLEAR           erases the current active file (if any) before doing the
                             FETCH.  The FETCH command cannot be executed until the active
                             file is empty.  When you have something in your active file
                             and issue a FETCH command without including the CLEAR option,
                             WYLBUR will ask for permission to clear the active file.
0            NOWARN          when specified with the CLEAR option, overrides WARN mode, the
                             logon default.  (Type HELP SET MODES WARN NOWARN for a
                             description of the WARN and NOWARN modes.)

             FIRST (line-number)                                    WYLBUR Reference Manual
0            FIRST is a symbolic line number that has the value of the line number of the
             first line in the file.  When you specify FIRST in a range for an external
             file, WYLBUR assigns it the value 0.
0            When the active file is empty, both FIRST and LAST have the value of 0.  (Note
             that this is also the case when the active file contains a single line with a
             line number of 0.)

0            The format-options allow you to specify three attributes of the data set:
0               1. record format and length, using LRECL, etc.
0               2. WYLBUR line number format, using NUMBERED, etc.

             FROM, PRINT FROM, PUNCH FROM, SAVE, SPELL FROM, USE, and the ORVYL commands
             GET and PUT.
0            If you do not specify a format, WYLBUR saves disk files in EDIT format (i.e.,
             EDIT is the default format).  Once you have created a disk file with the
             desired format, WYLBUR automatically recognizes the format for USE commands
             and SAVE...REPLACE commands.
0            Special caution must be used when specifying an explicit format for saving
             library members.  (Type HELP LIBRARY for a definition of library.)  The format
             attributes apply to the entire WYLBUR user library and not the library members
             individually.  Thus, if the format of the member does not agree with that of
             the library, WYLBUR issues a warning message like the following:
0                 Warning: Data set type will be changed to PO U/6356/6356
                  OK (Yes/No)?
0            If you reply OK, YES or Y, WYLBUR changes the format of the library to the
             specified format.  However, the new format attributes of the library may not
             reflect the actual format attributes of the older library members.  Thus,
             programs using these members may encounter difficulties, and the CONDENSE
             program may destroy the old members.  (Type HELP CONDENSE for a description of
             the CONDENSE command.)  WYLBUR will be able to access the old members only if
             their format is explicitly given.

                             Internally, active files are always treated as EDIT format.
                             The line number format and position need not be specified with
                             the EDIT option.  Library members assume the format of the

                             between 1 and 235 inclusive.  On a SAVE, the records may be

0                            blocking factor is not specified in a SAVE, WYLBUR chooses an
                             optimal blocking factor based on device type.  If the actual
                             physical block size is not an integral multiple of nnn on a
                             read, any characters remaining after all possible lines of nnn
                             characters have been extracted will become a separate record.
                             CARD is equivalent to LRECL=80; PRINT is equivalent to
                             LRECL=133.  Using these options on a USE command may produce
                             some rather odd looking data if the data set being read does
                             not actually contain fixed records.
0            NUMBERED        on a write operation (e.g. SAVE), it specifies a fixed-length
                             blocked record format and that line numbers are to be saved as
                             part of the record in the normal WYLBUR line number form; that
                             is, nnnnn.nnn with leading blanks inserted as necessary and
                             trailing zeroes suppressed.  On a read operation (e.g., USE,
                             COPY FROM, EXECUTE FROM) it specifies that the data set is to
                             be treated as NUMBERED fixed or variable-length blocked.  For
                             non-EDIT format data sets WYLBUR uses the line number stored
                             in the record and deletes from the record the columns that
                             contain the line number.
0            UNNUMBERED      on a write operation (e.g., SAVE), it specifies a fixed-length
                             blocked record format without line numbers in the record.  On
                             a read operation (e.g., USE, COPY FROM, EXECUTE FROM), it
                             specifies that the data set is to be treated as UNNUMBERED
                             fixed or variable-length blocked.
0            INTEGER         has the same meaning as NUMBERED except that the the WYLBUR
                             line number is multiplied by 1000, placed in an 8-digit field,
                             and padded with leading zeroes as necessary (e.g., line number
                             1 becomes 00001000).
0            SEQFLD=({ENDëpos}[,len])
                             on a write operation (e.g., SAVE), SEQFLD specifies that this
                             is a NUMBERED fixed block SAVE.  On a read operation (e.g.,
                             USE, COPY FROM, EXECUTE FROM), it specifies that the data set
                             is to be treated as NUMBERED fixed or variable-length blocked.
                             The subparameters of SEQFLD specify the position and length of
                             the line numbers in the record.  The default position is the
                             last 8 positions of each record (SEQFLD=(END,8)).  Any column
                             position (pos) and any length (len) less than 10 can be
                             specified.  On a write operation, line numbers are truncated
                             on the left to the length specified without checking for loss
                             of digits.  The parentheses can be omitted if the length is
                             not changed.

0            The HELP command provides information about the syntax, function, and options
             of most WYLBUR commands.  In addition, it provides definitions of terminology
             (e.g., HELP VOLUME, HELP DSNAME) and aids to further assistance (e.g., HELP
             PHONES, HELP CONSULTING).
0            If you type a command without options (e.g., HELP SHOW DIRECTORY), WYLBUR
             displays the syntax and the general description of the command and prompts for
             any specific options you want more information about.  In addition, you can
             precede a WYLBUR command that includes options with the word HELP, and WYLBUR
             gives as much specific information about the command as it can.  For example:
0                 HELP SHOW DIRECTORY LIKE FOO
0            WYLBUR displays the syntax and general description for the SHOW DIRECTORY
             command, as well as a description of the LIKE option.  WYLBUR looks for clues
             in what you type, rather than insisting on a specific syntax.  Consider
             another example:
0                 HELP PRINT 50/L UNN FORMS BOND DUPLEX
0            WYLBUR displays the syntax of the PRINT command and then describes information
             about the UNN, FORMS and DUPLEX options.  Of course, you can also get exactly
             the same information by typing the following:
0                 HELP PRINT UNN FORMS DUPLEX
0            Use the HELP command with a collect-option to put the information you specify
             into your active file.  Two examples follow:

                  HELP 'PHONES' COLLECT
0            You must enclose the specified information in apostrophes or quotation marks,
             as shown in the example above.

0            The HOLD command allows you to stop the processing of a job or jobs at certain
             key points.   When you specify the HOLD command without an output or queue
             option, the system determines the HOLD point.  Jobs waiting for execution are
             placed in user hold and jobs in execution or the output queue are placed in
             output hold.  You can specify HOLD as an option on the RUN command.  Type HELP
             RUN HOLD for more information.
0            The RELEASE command releases a job from HOLD status.  Type HELP RELEASE for a

0            The INSERT command allows you to add individual lines of text to the active
             file.  Only the line numbers you specify will be inserted.  (Use the COLLECT
             command to insert lines with an automatic increment.  Type HELP COLLECT for a
             description of the command.)
0            The short form of the INSERT command consists of responding to the command
             prompt by typing in a single line number, followed by a blank character and
             the contents of the new line of text.  When NOSHORT mode is in effect, WYLBUR
             accepts this short form only after a permission prompt.  (Type HELP SET MODES
             SHORT NOSHORT for a description of the SHORT and NOSHORT modes.)  Note that L
             and F, the normal abbreviations for the symbolic line numbers LAST and FIRST,
             may not be used for this form of the INSERT command.
0            Using the short form of this command in an EXEC file to insert an already
             existing line in the active file causes an error message and an EXEC BREAK.
             (Type HELP EXECUTE for an explanation of an EXEC BREAK.)  However, you can use
             the short form in an EXEC file to insert a line or to replace an already
             existing line.
0            After typing a line to be inserted, you can type an @ sign and press the BREAK
             key to MODIFY or EDIT that line.  MODIFY or EDIT is selected based on the mode
             in effect.  (Type HELP SET MODES MODIFY EDIT for a description of the MODIFY
             and EDIT modes.)  Just typing @ and pressing the BREAK key as the only
             response to the line number prompt, allows you to MODIFY or EDIT the previous
             line.  For example:
0               Command> insert 5
                    5.   > This is line five@***
                    5.     This is line five

                             Specifying (n) means that n lines are to be inserted starting
                             at the given line number.  WYLBUR will automatically choose an
                             appropriate increment to accommodate the lines.  You may
                             specify as many line numbers as you wish, with or without the
                             (n).  WYLBUR will prompt with each line number specified or
                             implied, unless DITTO has also been specified.

-            DITTO           causes the contents of the first inserted line to be repeated
                             at each of the remaining lines to be inserted.  WYLBUR will
                             prompt only with the first line number.  For example:
0                               INSERT 3, 5(2), 7 DITTO
0                            causes WYLBUR to prompt for line 3 and then to insert two
                             copies of line 3 starting at line 5 and one copy at line 7.
0            UPPERëUPLOW     when specified with INSERT, UPPER or UPLOW provides a
                             temporary override of the session case setting.  UPLOW causes
                             WYLBUR to retain the case (upper, lower, or a mixture) of the
                             text collected.  UPPER causes WYLBUR to convert all lowercase
                             letters to uppercase as the text is collected.  (Type HELP
                             SET TERMINAL CASE for a further description of case settings.)
0            list-options    NOLIST is the default for this command.  If LIST is is

                             (even if DITTO is specified).  As with DELETE, L is an
                             abbreviation for LAST rather than LIST.  (For a description of
                             the list-options, type HELP LIST-OPTIONS.)
0            length-options  provide an override for the global length message (established
                             with the SET LENGTH command).  If you specify NOLENGTH, the
                             warning message about excess length will not be issued (unless
                             the line is over 235 characters).  Type HELP LENGTH-OPTIONS

0            Jobid is an option of the ALTER, CANCEL, FETCH, HOLD, RELEASE, LOCATE, and
             PURGE commands.  You can use it to specify the jobs to which the command
             applies.
0            jobstem    is a 1-8 character string, not enclosed in apostrophes, that is
                        compared with all jobnames in the system (whether they belong to
                        you or not).  The command will affect all jobs whose names match
                        the jobstem for as many characters as given in the jobstem.
0            'jobname'  is a 1-8 character string enclosed in apostrophes.  This form is
                        similar to the jobstem except that the command will affect only
                        those jobs whose names match the given string exactly.  Since
                        jobnames have at most 8 characters, an 8 character string without
                        apostrophes (a jobstem) is equivalent to the same string with
                        apostrophes (a 'jobname').
0            jobnumber  is the job number assigned by the system when the job is submitted.
                        It will be a number between 1 and 9999.  This is one way to specify
                        a single, unique job.
0            *[-n]      if the command is submitted through WYLBUR, * is equivalent to the
                        last job submitted during the current terminal session.  *-n, where
                        n is an integer, refers to a previous job regardless of jobnames
                        used.  For example:
0                          Command> print
                           JOB 1234 UUUGG011 AWAITING PRINT...

0            The JOIN command joins two or more lines and replaces the first line specified
             with the result.  The second and subsequent lines are deleted, unless you
             specify the NODELETE option.  One blank space separates the lines once they
             are joined, unless you specify the SEPARATOR option.  Remember that no line in

0            The JUSTIFY command formats paragraphs with whatever margins or indentations
             you choose, regardless of how the text was entered.  WYLBUR adjusts the
             contents of the lines in the specified range so that each line contains the
             exact number of specified LENGTH characters.
0            When text must be moved from one line to another during justifying, WYLBUR
             splits the text at a blank (a word is never split onto two lines); it joins
             the rearranged text with a single blank.  WYLBUR inserts two blanks between
             the two parts, if the first part ends in one of the following characters:
0                 ? : . !
0            It pads the lines with blanks, if necessary.  (If you do not want lines padded
             with blanks, use the ALIGN command.  Type HELP ALIGN for a description of the
             command.)  WYLBUR renumbers the portion of the file that was justified.
0            Option Descriptions
+            ___________________
0            range           specifies the upper and lower limit of a group of lines to be
                             justified.  This option is required and must be specified
                             first.  Justification restarts whenever nonconsecutive lines
                             in a range are encountered or when a new range is started, as
                             in a disjoint range.  (Type HELP RANGE for a description of a
                             disjoint range.)
0            LENGTH=nnn      specifies the length to which the line will be justified (nnn
                             is a value of 1 to 235 characters).  If this option is not
                             included, the lines will be justified to the current value of
                             LENGTH.  (Type HELP SET LENGTH for a description of LENGTH.)
0            MARKER=c        c is any character.  Lines containing the marker character in
                             column 1 will remain unchanged and the justification process
                             will be restarted with a new paragraph.  The characters:
0                               ( ) " , ' =
0                            must be in quotation marks.  Blank lines are always treated as
                             marker lines.
0            INDENT=x[[+]yë-y]
                             justifies indented material (i.e., text not beginning in
                             column 1) that is ordinarily ignored if this option is not
                             specified.  x is an integer and specifies that lines indented
                             x spaces should be used for continuation lines of a paragraph.
                             y is a positive or negative integer and specifies that any
                             line with ADDITIONAL indentation of y spaces should be used

0                            for the first line of a paragraph.  The default value of y is
                             0.  A negative value produces "hanging indents".
0                            If EVEN is not specified, only text whose indentation matches
                             the specified INDENT values will be justified.  Text beginning
                             in column 1 has the indentation value of 0.  If the INDENT
                             option is not specified, a default value of INDENT=0 0 is
                             used.  Examples of this option are included below, following
                             the option descriptions.
0            EVEN            must be used to cause any change in the existing indentation
                             of text.  If EVEN is specified, WYLBUR ignores existing
                             indentations, justifies all non-marker lines using the
                             indentations specified or defaulted, and starts a new
                             paragraph only after a blank line, a line with the marker
                             character, or when the range is not consecutive.  An example
                             of this option is included below, following the option
                             descriptions.
0            SPACE           removes extra spaces that may have been inserted by a previous
                             JUSTIFY command.  Unless SPACE is used, extra blanks from the
                             previous justification or alignment will be kept as part of
                             the text when it is rejustified.  Two blanks are always left
                             after the characters:
0                               ? : . !
0            NUMBER          causes the entire file to be renumbered after the
                             justification process is complete.  The starting line number
                             and the line increment will both be delta.  (Type HELP DELTA
                             for a definition of delta.)  If this option is not specified,
                             only those lines in the aligned range will be renumbered.
0            list-options    LIST specifies that the line be listed after it is justified.
                             NOLIST is the default.  For additional list-options, type HELP
                             LIST-OPTIONS.
-            Examples to illustrate the use of options, INDENT=x [y] and EVEN:
+            _________________________________________________________________
0            Assume the range to be justified consists of two paragraphs.  Each paragraph
             contains contiguous lines of text beginning in column 6, and the paragraphs
             are separated by a blank line.
0            Example 1:   You want to retain column 6 as the beginning of all lines and to
             justify them to a uniform length of 68.  To accomplish this, you would give
             the command:
0                 JUSTIFY range LENGTH=68 INDENT=5
0            Example 2:   You want to justify the two paragraphs to length 68, with the
             first line of each paragraph beginning in column 10 and the body of the
             paragraph beginning in column 6.  You would give the command:

0                 JUSTIFY range LENGTH=68 INDENT=5+4 EVEN
0            WYLBUR indents the first line 9 spaces (5+4) and the body 5 spaces, until the
             blank line between the paragraphs is encountered, signaling the beginning of a
             new paragraph.  EVEN is necessary because you want the indentation of the text
             changed (i.e., the indentation for the first line of each paragraph is to
             change from 5 to 9).  In the first example, EVEN is not necessary because the
             indentation of text is NOT to be changed.

0            LAST is a symbolic line number that has the value of the line number of the
             last line in the file.  If a file has only one line, FIRST and LAST are equal.
             When LAST is used in a range for an external file, it is assigned the value of
             99999.999.
0            When the active file is empty, both FIRST and LAST have the value of 0.  (Note
             that this is also the case when the active file contains a single line with a

0            The length-options are used to override the value of LENGTH (established with
             the SET LENGTH command) for the duration of a command.  You may specify length
             options on most editing commands.
0            Option Descriptions
+            ___________________
0            LENGTH=n        specifies the line length (n) to use for the duration of the
                             current command.  If a line is changed and is longer than n
                             characters, a warning is given.
0            NOLENGTH        means that no warning is given unless the line becomes too
                             long for WYLBUR (over 235 characters, in which case, it will
                             be truncated.
0            NOTES:
+            ______
0               1. The form LENGTH=n is rarely used on editing commands.  It is more
                   convenient to SET LENGTH n before a sequence of editing commands and
                   then set it back to its previous value rather than specifying it for
                   each command in the sequence.
0               2. NOLENGTH is often specified with the CHANGE and MODIFY commands when
                   intermediate changes are expected to cause lines to be longer than the
                   LENGTH setting.
0               3. NOLENGTH is abbreviated NOLE or NOLEN because NOL is an abbreviation for
                   NOLIST.

             Library                                                WYLBUR Reference Manual
0            A library is a special kind of data set also called a partitioned data set (or
             PDS).  It is made up of a directory and one or more "subfiles" called members.
             The directory functions as a table of contents and contains the name of each
             member, as well as a pointer to its location within the library.  For each
             member, the directory also contains the date and time saved, the account
             number that created the member, and an optional title of up to 42 characters.
0            A library is allocated one or more tracks of disk space.  Each track holds
             about 47,000 characters, approximately 700 lines.  Only a fraction of a track
             is set aside for the directory of a library, but it is enough for
             approximately 150 member names.  The members of a library take up only as much
             space in the library as they need.  Therefore, you can fit many small members
             on each track.  Libraries not only save disk space, they also provide a
             convenient way to organize disk files into related groups.
0            Use the ALLOCATE command to set aside space for a library, for example:
0               Command> allocate lib
0            Type HELP ALLOCATE for a description of setting up a library.  Once you have
             allocated a library and saved several members, you may want to issue a SHOW
             DIRECTORY command to display the member names and their optional titles.
             (Type SHOW DIRECTORY for a description of the command.)  Note that you can use
             an optional title of up to 42 characters as a reminder about what each member
             contains.  To specify a title, include a TITLE option when you are saving a
             library member, for example:
0               Command> save #song title='Blue Kentucky Girl'
0            Once you have a library, you will have to condense it periodically to remove
             the dead space and to allow additional members to be saved.  (Type HELP
             CONDENSE for a description of the CONDENSE command.)  Whenever an attempted
             SAVE of a library member cannot be completed because of insufficient space in
             the library, WYLBUR prompts you with "Condense (Yes/No)?".  To have the
             library condensed, reply YES, Y or OK.  When the condense job is completed,
             you may issue your SAVE command again.  You can usually recover a "scratched"
             or replaced library member until a library is condensed, so CONDENSE should be
             used cautiously if you want to take advantage of that backup feature.  If you
             cannot SAVE immediately after the completion of the CONDENSE job, you must
             expand your library.  To do so, issue the command:

             Line-number                                            WYLBUR Reference Manual
0            The general form of a line number is as follows:
0                 {number}[{+ë-}increment]
0            number      may be either a constant between .001 and 99999.999, or one of the
                         symbolic line numbers described below.
0            increment   may be either a constant between .001 and 99999.999, or the
                         current value of delta.  (Type HELP DELTA for a description of
                         delta.)
0            Consider the following when specifying line numbers in a command:
0               1. When specifying decimals, you can leave out leading and trailing zeros
                   (e.g., 1.2 rather than 00001.200) without affecting the significance,
                   except in determining a value for delta in the commands COPY, MOVE, and
                   COLLECT.  (Type HELP DELTA for a description of delta.)
0               2. You can specify whole numbers without a decimal.  Thus, 17.0, 17., and
                   17 are equivalent.
0               3. Observe the following additional rules, if you use the form,
                   number{+ë-}increment:
0                  a. Specify the number and the plus or minus sign without a blank in
                      between (e.g., COLLECT FIRST+2).
0                  b. The resulting number must be between 0 and 99999.999.
-            Symbolic line numbers
+            _____________________
0            Symbolic line numbers are changing pointers to lines in an active or execute
             file.  There are 7 symbolic line numbers:
0                 FIRST
                  LAST
                  END
                  PREVIOUS
                  CURRENT or *
                  NEXT
                  RETURN
0            FIRST and LAST are the first and last lines in a file and always exist even if
             the file has no lines.  Both have the value 0 if the file is empty.
0            END points to the line number that WYLBUR would add after the last line.  It
             has the value of delta when the file is empty.  (Type HELP SET DELTA for a
             description of delta.)
0            CURRENT is the line most recently edited; NEXT is the line immediately after
             CURRENT, and PREVIOUS is the line immediately before it.  When a line has been
             edited, it means that WYLBUR has executed an editing command such as:  ALIGN,
             CENTER, COPY, DELETE, EDIT, INSERT, JUSTIFY, MODIFY, MOVE, NUMBER, POINT, or

0            REPLACE.  If the file has not been edited or if it is empty, PREVIOUS,
             CURRENT, and NEXT do not exist.  Under these conditions, the value given to
             PREVIOUS, CURRENT, or NEXT will be -1.000 if they are part of an expression.
             This value assignment is useful in EXEC files.
0            For an external file, the symbolic line numbers CURRENT and LAST are assigned
             the values 0 and 99999.999 respectively; the symbolic line numbers PREVIOUS
             and NEXT never exist.
0            The symbolic line number RETURN is designed to be used in EXEC files and
             provides a subroutine facility.  RETURN is initialized to 0 and can only be
             changed with the commands SET RETURN and EXECUTE SAVE.
0            For a more detailed explanation of these symbolic line numbers, refer to the
             individual entries (e.g., type HELP CURRENT, HELP LAST, etc.).

                             is specified, columns n through 235 are used.  Otherwise, the
                             entire line is used.
0            MARKER=c        causes the listing to be suspended at any line that has the
                             marker character in column 1.  The marker character (c) can be
                             any character, although if it is one of the following it must
                             be enclosed in quotation marks or apostrophes:
0                               ) ( " ' = , ; blank
0                            Listing is restarted by pressing the RETURN key.  The line
                             containing the marker character is not listed, but a blank
                             line will occur because of the carriage return needed to
                             restart the listing.  A blank line may be inserted as a marker
                             in a line range.  If a blank line is used, the MARKER
                             character must be specified as a blank ' '.
0            INDENT=n        inserts n blanks at the left of each line listed.
0            DOUBLEëTRIPLE   produce a listing with double or triple spacing, respectively.
                             Single spacing is the default.
0            SQUASHED        squashes all multiple blanks to single blanks before listing
                             the line.  The file is not changed.  This option is very
                             useful when looking at fetched output since listing lines
                             containing many blanks can be very slow at a terminal.
0            NONL            suppresses the automatic insertion of the NL (new line or
                             carriage return) character in text being listed at the
                             terminal.  It is particularly well suited for online plotting
                             at the terminal.  However, use of NONL requires that an NL
                             (X'15') be included in the text stream wherever a new line is
                             to occur.
0            CLEAN           will prevent messages from other terminals from interrupting
                             an online listing.  However, messages from the operator will
                             interrupt.

0            The LOGOFF command ends the terminal session and disconnects your terminal
             from the computer.  LOGOFF, LOGOUT, and SIGNOFF are equivalent.
0            If your active file is not empty when you issue the LOGOFF command, WYLBUR
             prompts to verify that your active file can be cleared, indicating the number
             of changes made since the last USE or SAVE command.  For example:
0                 <n> changes, Clear ACTIVE (Yes/No)?
0            If you respond YES, Y, or OK, and press the RETURN key, WYLBUR clears your
             active file and logs you off.  If you press the BREAK key, WYLBUR aborts the
             LOGOFF command and returns you to COMMAND mode.
0            WYLBUR also saves your active file if the computer or WYLBUR malfunctions
             ("crashes" or "goes down"), or if your terminal connection is broken for any
             reason.  If this happens, WYLBUR restores your active file, the next time you

0            The LOGON command is like the LOGOFF command; it ends the terminal session.
             However, it does not disconnect your terminal from the computer; instead it
             initiates the logon procedure.  This allows an account other than the one
             currently logged-on to access the computer without losing the line (or
             connection).  LOGON, LOGIN, and SIGNON are equivalent.
0            If your active file is not empty when you issue the LOGON command, WYLBUR
             prompts you to verify that your active file can be cleared, indicating the
             number of changes made since the last USE or SAVE command.  For example:
0                 <n> changes, Clear ACTIVE (Yes/No)?
0            If you respond YES, Y, or OK, and press the RETURN key, WYLBUR clears your
             active file, ends your terminal session, and initiates the logon procedure.
             If you press the BREAK key, WYLBUR aborts the LOGON command and returns you to
             COMMAND mode.
0            Once the logon procedure is initiated, enter your ITS account and password in
             response to the system prompts.  (For a description of the logon procedure,

                             description of range.)
0            EXECUTE         specifies that the EXEC file be mailed.  If this option is not
                             specified, the active file will be sent.  (Type HELP EXECUTE
                             for a description of the EXEC file.)
0            NAME='name'     specifies a name that will appear in the system message sent
                             to the recipient, both when the mail is actually displayed and
                             in the SHOW MAIL SUMMARY response.  The name must be enclosed
                             in apostrophes (for example, MAIL NAME='WILLIE NELSON' TO
                             E1.ABC).  If this option is not included, the name displayed
                             will be that specified by the SET NAME command.
0            TO {uuuëgg.uuuë(...,...,...)}
                             uuu specifies that the mail is to be sent to the user in the

                             be sent to the account specified.  Multiple accounts are
                             allowed when separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses.
0            TITLE='title'   is the title (subject matter) of the mail being sent.  The
                             title must be enclosed in apostrophes (for example, MAIL TO
                             E1.ABC TITLE='Class Schedule').  It will be included in system
                             messages sent to the recipient, both when the mail is actually
                             displayed, and in the SHOW MAIL SUMMARY response.
0            NONOTIFY        is a WYLBUR option that suppresses the MAIL notification

0            The MODIFY command allows you to make insertions, replacements, and deletions
             to the contents of each line in a specified range of the active file.  WYLBUR
             prompts you for alterations until the range is exhausted.  For each line
             specified the following process is carried out.
0            WYLBUR lists the unmodified line and then prompts you with "Mods  > " so you
             can make changes to the line using the modify characters described below.  You
             signal the end of your alterations by pressing the RETURN key.  WYLBUR types
             the altered line for inspection, unless NOLIST is specified, and prompts for
             more alterations to the line unless SINGLE is specified.
0            By pressing the RETURN key in answer to the Mods prompt, you can move to the
             next line.  To stop the modification process, press the BREAK key and the line
             will remain unchanged.  You can also type a question mark (?) in response to
             the Mods prompt to get a list of some of the characters available for response
             to the prompt.
0            MODIFY Characters
+            _________________
0            To modify a line, type in one of the following characters (in upper- or
             lowercase) in response to the Mods prompt.  Note that you use the [n]
             specified with some of the characters to specify the length of the
             modification, thus allowing multiple modifications.
0            [n]B   To blank out individual characters in a line, type a B under each
                    position to be replaced with a blank.  Only those positions are
                    blanked; no shifting of the line takes place.  After typing a B, you
                    can make additional alterations to the line before pressing the RETURN
                    key.
0            [n]C   Type the letter C to invert the case of the text (i.e., uppercase
                    becomes lowercase and lowercase becomes uppercase).  Case change is
                    ignored if the character is non-alphabetic.
0            [n]D   To delete a string of characters from the line type a D under the first
                    character to be removed.  You can terminate the deletion range by
                    inserting or replacing as described above or by pressing the RETURN
                    key.  If the deletion range is terminated by pressing the RETURN key,
                    all characters from the first D up to the RETURN are deleted.  A
                    deleted character is not replaced by a blank; blanks are treated as a
                    continuation of the deletion range and the remaining text is shifted to
                    the left by the number of spaces deleted.
0            [n]E   Type the letter E to switch to EDIT mode for altering the rest of the
                    line.

0            [n]I   Type the letter I (for INSERT) immediately below the character in the
                    line in front of which characters are to be inserted.  Follow the
                    letter I with the string of characters you want to insert.  Terminate
                    the string of characters to be inserted by pressing the RETURN key.
0            L      Type an L and press the RETURN key to list the line being modified as
                    it currently stands.
0            N      Type an N before any other alteration character to suspend the printing
                    of the altered line.  You can type an L to override a NOLIST option so
                    that the altered line is listed.  Both LIST and NOLIST are options of
                    the MODIFY command.  (See the description of list-options below for an
                    explanation.)
0            [n]R   Type the character R (for REPLACE) immediately below the first
                    character to be replaced in the line and type the string of replacement
                    characters immediately following the R.  As many characters are
                    replaced as there are characters in the replacement string.  Terminate
                    the string of characters to be replaced by pressing the RETURN key.
0            S      Type the letter S to split a line into one or more lines.  The new
                    line(s) go after the original line (WYLBUR selects an appropriate
                    delta).  The lines are listed and you are then prompted for
                    modifications to the line created after the last S.  A reply of
                    pressing the BREAK key (only) to the Mods prompt will abort the
                    previous split.  If you modify the new line, the split is confirmed and
                    the active file is changed at that time.
0            cT     Type a column number (c) and the letter T to position the cursor so
                    that it is under is under column c.  For example, if you type the
                    sequence 72TIX the cursor is positioned at column 72 and an X is
                    inserted.  If t is an asterisk (*), the cursor will be positioned at
                    the end of the line.
0            [n]X   Typing the letter X instead of the letter D allows you to delete
                    multiple pieces of a line of text with one modification.  Blanks are
                    not treated as a continuation of the deletion range.
0            BREAK Key
+            _________
0            The use of the BREAK key, alone or in combination with special characters is
             identical to its use in the EDIT command.  Type HELP EDIT to get a description
             of the use of the BREAK key with both the MODIFY and the EDIT commands.
0            Length Specification
+            ____________________
0            If you want to modify an optional number of characters (between 1 and 235),
             you can include a length specification with some modify characters.  The
             modify characters that include a length specification are:  INSERT, REPLACE,
             DELETE, EXPEL, BLANK, and CASE.  If you use an asterisk (*) as the length
             specification, WYLBUR uses the number of characters that remain in the line as
             the length.  For example:
-
                                                - 120 -

0               10B    means blank the next ten characters beginning with the character
                       underneath which you have typed the 1.
0               *C     means change the case of all the characters (starting at the
                       character above the "*") that remain in the line.
0               2I//   means insert two slashes (//) before the character underneath which
                       you have typed the 2.  Other modifications can follow this sequence;
                       however, this would not be the case if only an I followed by two
                       slashes had been typed.
0               *D     means delete to the end of the line.
0            Length specifications can be positive (*+n) or negative (*-n).  For example,
             *-1B will blank out the rest of the line except for the last character.
0            Line-Oriented Functions
+            _______________________
0            You can enter a line-oriented function in response to the Mods prompt; you
             must precede it by a period.  The available line-oriented functions are listed
             below.
0               .COLLECT    causes a prompt for new lines after the line being modified.
                (or .C)     Collecting new lines implies the acceptance of the
                            modifications to the current line.
0               .DELETE     deletes the line.
                (or .D)
0               .EDIT       accepts modifications to the current line and switches to EDIT
                (or .E)     mode.
0               .INSERT     causes a prompt for a new line after the line being modified.
                (or .I)     Inserting a new line implies the acceptance of the
                            modifications to the current line.
0               .JOIN       appends the next line to the line currently being modified.
                (.J)        The joined line is deleted when the modification is accepted.
0               .LINE line  accepts modifications to the current line and then begins
                            modification of the line indicated.
0               .NEXT       accepts modifications to the current line and then begins
                            modification of the next line.
0               .PREVIOUS   accepts modifications to the current line and then begins
                            modification of the previous line.
0               .REPLACE    replaces the entire line.  A line prompt for the replacement
                (or .R)     will follow.
0               .REVERT     changes the line back to its original state (i.e., before
                            any modifications were made).

0            Option Descriptions
+            ___________________
0            range           is the range of lines to be changed.  If specified, it must be
                             the first option.  If this option is not specified, the entire
                             file is assumed.  Type HELP RANGE for a description of range.
0            COLUMNS=m[/n]   restricts the modifications to the columns specified.  When n
                             is specified, modifications take place from column m to the
                             end of the line.  m/n gives a specific number of columns to be
                             modified.  When text is deleted, blanks are inserted at the
                             ending column and any text past the last column specified will
                             be lost (a message to that effect will be displayed at your
                             terminal).
0            SINGLE          causes WYLBUR to prompt for alteration of a line only once
                             instead of continuing to prompt you until you press the RETURN
                             key as the first character of the line.
0            UPPERëUPLOW     when specified with MODIFY, UPPER or UPLOW provides a
                             temporary override of the session case setting.  UPLOW causes
                             WYLBUR to retain the case (upper, lower, or a mixture) of the
                             modified text.  UPPER causes WYLBUR to convert all lowercase
                             letters to uppercase as the text is modified.  (Type HELP SET
                             TERMINAL CASE for a further description of case settings.)
0            list-options    LIST, the default, lists the corrected line; this option can
                             be suppressed by specifying NOLIST.  For additional
                             list-options, type HELP LIST-OPTIONS.  See the description of
                             the MODIFY characters above for another way to specify LIST
                             and NOLIST.
0            length-options  provide an override for the global length message (established
                             with the SET LENGTH command).  If you specify NOLENGTH, the
                             warning message about excess length will not be issued (unless
                             the line is over 235 characters).  Type HELP LENGTH-OPTIONS
                             for a description of the length options.

0            The MOVE command copies a range of lines from one place in the active file to
             another and deletes the old copy of the lines.  It functions exactly like the
             COPY command with these exceptions:
0               1. The lines that were copied are deleted from their original location.
0               2. It is not possible to apply the MOVE command to an external or EXEC
                   file.  The design of WYLBUR allows you to take destructive action only
                   upon the current active file (unless you explicitly erase an entire
                   external file).
0               3. The range must be specified, along with either the TO or the PLUS
                   option.
0            Option Descriptions
+            ___________________
0            range           is the range of lines to be moved.  This option is required
                             and must be specified first.  Type HELP RANGE for a
                             description of range.
0            TO line-number  specifies the beginning line number in the active file to
                             which the range of lines is to be moved.  Either TO or PLUS
                             must be specified with the MOVE command.
0            BY increment    is the line number increment, or delta, by which the
                             successive line numbers of the moved range are incremented.
                             If not specified, the default value is selected.  (Type HELP
                             DELTA for a description of delta.)  If the value of delta,
                             specified or default, would cause the moved lines to
                             interleave existing lines in the file, WYLBUR automatically
                             calculates a new value of delta so that interleaving does not
                             take place.  (See the MERGE option for exceptions.)
0            MERGE           allows interleaving þþ but no replacement þþ of the moved
                             lines with the existing lines.  The moved lines will not
                             retain their original line numbers.
0            PLUS [-]n       specifies a positive or negative number that is to be added to
                             each line number of the range to be moved.  (PLUS implies
                             MERGE.)
0            REPLACE         specifies that the moved lines can replace and/or interleave
                             existing lines.  WYLBUR will not change the increment when
                             REPLACE is specified.
0            list-options    NOLIST is the default for this command.  LIST causes WYLBUR to
                             list the line immediately preceding the line moved to, as well

0            NEXT is a symbolic line number that refers to the line immediately following
             CURRENT.  NEXT is set to -1.000 if the value of CURRENT has not been set, or

0            BY increment    specifies the line number increment to be used in determining

                             the range specified, a smaller increment will be used.  This
                             option cannot be used with TIMES or PLUS.
0            PLUS [-]n       specifies a positive or negative increment to be added to each
                             line number in the range to be renumbered to form the new line
                             numbers.  Although the increment may be any number, including

                             at the terminal.  However, use of NONL requires that an NL

                             to occur.

                             interrupt.

                             only the text of the lines in the range and shifts the text to
                             the left.  NOTEXT suppresses printing of the text and lists
                             only the numbers.  NONUMBERED lists the text only and replaces

0            HEXëMIXED       HEX specifies that the listing be in hexadecimal
                             representation.  MIXED causes all nonprinting (control)
                             characters to be displayed in their EBCDIC hexadecimal format,
                             enclosed in angle brackets.  For example, <270C> represents
                             the two characters X'27' and X'0C'.
0            CCëMC           CC or MC causes the character in column 1 of each line in the
                             range to be treated as a printer control character.  MC is
                             valid only for files with machine control (MC) characters such
                             as those normally created by some of the IBM assemblers or
                             compilers or fetched using the MC parameter.
0            NOCCëNOMC       overrides the CC and MC options.  This option is only useful
                             if either CC or MC is included in in an OPTIONS: line in the
                             data set you want printed.
0            COLUMNS=m[/n]   will cause only columns m through n of a line to be listed.
                             If the COLUMNS option is not specified, m defaults to column
                             1; n to column 235.  (The actual number of columns that can be
                             printed depends on the options: FORMS, CHARS, and
                             list-options.)

0            INDENT=n        inserts n blanks at the left of each listed line.  If INDENT=0
                             is specified, printer control characters are assumed to be in
                             column 1 of each line of the file and the UNNUMBERED
                             list-option is assumed.  CC characters are expected unless the
                             MC option is also used.  CC or MC alone may be used to get
                             numbered listings with carriage control.
0            DOUBLEëTRIPLE   produce a listing with double or triple spacing, respectively.
                             Single spacing is the default.
0            EJECT=nëNOEJECT EJECT specifies the number of lines to be printed before the
                             page is ejected.  This number must be between 0 and 255.  If
                             EJECT is not specified, a page eject will occur after 60 lines
                             of printing.  NOEJECT permits lines to be printed to the
                             bottom of the page and over the page perforations.  (This
                             option is invalid when using the 3800 printer.)
0            NOBACK          prevents backspaces in the text from being printed.  By
                             default, text with backspaces is printed as it would be on a
                             terminal.  This option is independent of the SET TERMINAL
                             {BACKëNOBACK} options.
0            DARK[=n]        produces an offline listing in which each line is printed two
                             (or n if n is specified) times.  Sometimes overprinting can
                             facilitate better reproduction.  This option reduces printing
                             speed considerably and increases your lines-printed charge by

                             left to right.  This jobname has the form uuuggnnn, where uuu
                             is the user code, gg is the group code and nnn is a

                             option is also specified.
0            ID={idë'id'}    is a character string used to override the ggnnn portion of of
                             the WYLBUR-generated jobname.  The jobname has the form
                             uuuggnnn, where uuu is the user code, gg is the group code and

0            HEADER='header' permits a title of up to 20 characters to be printed on the
                             job header and trailer sheets of your output.  If this option
                             is specified with the TITLE option, the HEADER takes the place
                             of the TITLE on the header and trailer sheets of your output.
0            UPLOW           specifies, for impact printers only, upper- and lowercase
                             printed output.  UPLOW is equivalent to SYSOUT=D.
0            FICHE           specifies that job output be directed to microfiche rather
                             than to a printer.
0            SYSOUT=s        specifies SYSOUT output classes.  See   for a

0            PRIORITY=priority
                             specifies the priority at which the job is to be printed.
                             Valid values, in order of increasing priority, are:  LOW,
                             STANDARD, or URGENT.  They may be abbreviated to L, S, U.
                             STANDARD priority is assumed if this option is not used.
                             URGENT priority will incur higher charges.  See DOC#RATES for

0            COPIES=nn       allows up to 99 copies to be made of the output.  If this
                             option is not specified, one copy will be printed.
0            BURST           BURST indicates that the output should be burst (separated)
                             and trimmed (left and right edges).  FORMS 9511 and 1281 are
                             burst and trimmed; FORMS 1181 is burst only.  Burst and
                             trimmed output from 1 to 5,000 pages is routed to your bin
                             within 24 hours from the time of printing.  If you also

-            NUMBEREDëRNUMBEREDëUNNUMBEREDëINTEGER
                             NUMBERED causes WYLBUR line numbers to be punched in columns
                             73-80 of the card, if those columns are blank.  If a line
                             number greater than 9999.999 is used in the range being
                             processed, the high-order digit will be truncated.  RNUMBERED
                             allows WYLBUR to put line numbers in columns 73-80 even if it
                             means replacing text originally in those columns.  UNNUMBERED
                             specifies that the WYLBUR line numbers are not to be punched
                             in columns 73-80 of the cards.  INTEGER has the same meaning
                             as RNUMBERED, except that the line number is an 8-digit
                             integer.  The numbering option for PUNCH defaults to the
                             option set with the SET JOB command; UNNUMBERED is the default
                             setting for new accounts.  Type HELP SET JOB NUMBERED

                             left to right.  This jobname has the form uuuggnnn, where uuu
                             is the user code, gg is the group code and nnn is a
                             WYLBUR-generated job number that is incremented each time a

0            ID={idë'id'}    is a character string used to override the ggnnn portion of of
                             the WYLBUR-generated jobname.  This jobname has the form
                             uuuggnnn, where uuu is the user code, gg is the group code and
                             nnn is a WYLBUR-generated job number that is incremented each
                             time a job is submitted.  The quoted 'id' form replaces the
                             string ggnnn.  The unquoted id form overlays the string ggnnn
                             character for character from left to right.

                             specifies the priority at which the job is to be punched.
                             Valid values, in order of increasing priority, are:  LOW,
                             STANDARD, or URGENT.  They may be abbreviated to L, S, U.
                             STANDARD priority is assumed if this option is not used.
                             URGENT priority will incur higher charges.  See DOC#RATES for

0            The PURGE command is used to remove a job (or jobs) from the system and to
             suppress the job's output.  PURGE can stop job processing when the job is in
             execution only if the CANCEL option is included.
0            Option Descriptions
+            ___________________
0            jobid           identifies the job(s) to be purged.  This option is required
                             and must be specified first.  If the jobid describes multiple
                             jobs, you must also include the MULTIPLE option.  Type HELP
                             JOBID for a description of the various forms of this option.
0            MULTIPLE        causes the command to be processed if the jobid matches more
                             than one jobname in the system.  When several jobs are
                             explicitly referred to by number, the MULTIPLE option is not
                             necessary.
0            account-options specify the account to purge a job or jobs belonging to an
                             account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                             this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                             for a description of the account-options.  If this option is
                             specified, you will be prompted for the password of the
                             account before the command is executed.
0            queue-options   allow further selection of jobs to be affected by the command.
                             Jobs must be in the specified queue (i.e., EXEC or OUTPUT) to
                             be affected.  Type HELP QUEUE-OPTIONS for a description of
                             these options.
0            output-options  allow you to restrict the effect of the PURGE command to
                             selected groups of data sets.  OUTPUT is the only valid
                             output-option when the job is awaiting execution.  However, as
                             soon as a job has begun execution, all other options may be
                             used.  Type HELP OUTPUT-OPTIONS for a description of the
                             output-options.
0            CANCEL          allows you to terminate a job that is in execution, and purge
                             any output.  If the job is not executing, the CANCEL option is
                             ignored but the PURGE command is executed.  If the job is
                             executing and the CANCEL option is not given, the PURGE
                             command will be rejected and a message to that effect will be
                             given.
0            collect-options allow you to insert the system response to the PURGE command
                             into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for a
                             description of these options.

0            A range is a set of lines and it is defined to be either an explicit range or
             an associative range.  Each of these is explained below.
0            The general form of a line number (such as LAST-5, *+1.2) may be used for the
             beginning or ending line number of a range.  The line numbers specifying the
             beginning or ending line need not exist in the range.  If the range you
             specify is an empty range (there are no lines in it), WYLBUR replys with NO
             LINES IN RANGE, or a similar message.
0            Explicit range
+            ______________
0            An explicit range is used to specify one or more lines by their numbers,
             rather than by their contents.  There are several possible forms for an
             explicit range:
0            ¿þþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþÜ

0            x               specifies the single line with line number x.  This is
                             equivalent to the form x/x.
0            x/y             is the range from line x through line y.  The letters x and y
                             should be replaced by line numbers giving the beginning and
                             end of the range.  x must be less than or equal to y.  x and y
                             are included in the range.  x and y may be symbolic line
                             numbers such as FIRST and LAST.
0            x(z)            means z lines beginning with x.  z must be a positive whole
                             number, while x must be a line number.  Example:  12(5) means
                             5 lines starting with 12.  Line 12 need not exist in the file;
                             if it does, it is counted as one of the 5 lines.
0            ALL             is equivalent to FIRST/LAST and refers to the entire active
                             file.  If an explicit range is not specified, ALL is the
                             default.
0            disjoint range  is a list of up to 10 line numbers.  The list may contain
                             single lines or groups, the ranges may overlap or they may be
                             in any order; however, each group counts as two of the line
                             numbers allowed.  The command is performed in the order in
                             which you specify the lines.  The ranges may be separated by
                             spaces or commas or both.  For example:
0                               13,21,20,12/15 LAST-2/LAST 17.2(3)
0                            Restrictions:
0                               1. A list of ranges referring to a disk file (such as with
                                   COPY...FROM) must be in ascending order and cannot
                                   overlap.

0                               2. A disjoint range cannot be used if an occurrence list is
                                   present in an associative range.  The occurrence list is
                                   specified by the option (x,x,...,x/y); see the
                                   description of this option below.  For example:
0                                     LIST 'A' (1) IN 4/6, 6/8, 9
0                                  is not valid.
-            Associative range
+            _________________
0            An associative range is used to specify one or more lines by their contents.
             In order to be included in the associative range, the group of lines must be
             within the specified explicit range or the default explicit range ALL (i.e.,
             the entire file).
0            Basically, a line is included within an associative range if it has met the
             following three conditions in the order specified:
0               1. The line is within the explicit range (specified or default).
0               2. The line passes the string test, which means:
0                  a. If a single string is specified, that string must or must not occur
                      in the specified or default columns.
0                  b. If multiple strings are specified, those strings must or must not
                      occur in the specified or default columns and they must satisfy the
                      logical conditions AND or OR.
0               3. The line is in the specified (if any) occurrence list.

0            ã               ã is the logical "not" sign (which appears as ~ (a tilde) on
                             some terminals and is not available on others).  It means that
                             the string condition is satisfied if the line does NOT contain
                             the string specified.
0            C               allows you to match an associative range regardless of the
                             case (upper, lower, or a mixture of upper and lower).  When
                             you use C'string', it does not matter whether UPLOW or UPPER
                             is in effect.  For example:
0                               LIST C'COMMENT'

-                            will list any lines containing COMMENT, comment, CommENT,
                             COmMeNt, and so on.
0            'string'        may consist of any combination of alphanumeric characters,
                             special characters, and blanks.  The null string '' or "" (a
                             pair of apostrophes right next to each other) is also allowed
                             and refers to completely blank lines.  The string condition is
                             satisfied for a line if it contains the string specified.
0            X'hexadecimal string'
                             allows you to use the hexadecimal representation of text when
                             specifying an associative range.  For example:
0                               LIST X'27'
0                            will list all lines that have the hexadecimal string '27'.
0            m[/n]           restricts the search for 'string' to columns m through n in a
                             given line.  If only m is specified, 'string' must begin in
                             that column.  If m and n are omitted, the entire line (columns
                             1 through 235) is searched.  When the null string is
                             specified, m and n must be omitted.
0            ANDëOR          multiple string tests can be specified by using AND or OR.
                             All tests separated by AND and any one or more tests separated
                             by OR must be successful in order for a line to pass the
                             string test.  AND and OR cannot be mixed in a single range.
                             The maximum number of string tests that may be specified is
                             about 6 (depending on the length of the strings).  A message
                             will be given if too many tests have been specified.
0            (x,x,...,x/y)   specifies an occurrence list that restricts the range to the
                             ordinal subset of lines that meet the string test.  x and/or y
                             specify the ordinal positions of that subset.  Thus, (3) and
                             (3/7) restrict the subset of lines to the third line and the
                             third through seventh lines, respectively, if they are in the
                             explicit range and satisfy the string tests.  For example:
0                               LIST 'people'(3) 10/15
0                            lists the third line in the range of lines 10/15 in your
                             active file, if it contains the character string 'people'.  A
                             disjoint range cannot be used if an occurrence list is
                             present.  (See the description of disjoint range above.)
0                            If x and y are omitted, all lines that pass the string test
                             and that are in the explicit range are included in the
                             associative range.
0            IN explicit range
                             gives an explicit range (see above) which will limit the group
                             of lines to be searched.  If an explicit range is not

0            NOTE:  All lines except blank lines have one instance of a blank string at the
             end of the line.  Thus, the correct associative range to retrieve blank lines
             is the null string þþ '' or "".  Associative ranges consisting of one or more
             blanks, such as ' ' or " ", will retrieve lines that have at least one
             non-blank character; blank lines will not be retrieved.

                             case.  UPPER causes information obtained by the READ command
                             to be converted to uppercase.  (Type HELP SET TERMINAL CASE
                             for a further description of case settings.)
0            STRING S-variable
                             stores a string passed from the terminal, the active file, or
                             the EXEC file in the specified S-variable.  The string does
                             not have to be enclosed in quotation marks or apostrophes,
                             unless they are considered part of the string.  The USING
                             option must be included to assign a string from the active
                             file, and both the USING and EXECUTE options must be used to
                             assign a string from the EXEC file.  If the USING option is
                             not specified, WYLBUR prompts for the string at the terminal.
0            VALUE list of variables
                             stores values passed from the terminal, the active file, or
                             the EXEC file to the specified predefined variables.  You can
                             assign as many as eight variables; however, multiple values
                             must be separated by commas or blanks.  WYLBUR evaluates any
                             expression(s) before assigning it to a variable.  String
                             values must be enclosed in quotation marks or apostrophes.
                             The USING option must be specified to assign a value from the
                             active file, and both the USING and EXECUTE options must be
                             specified to assign a value from the EXEC file.  If the USING
                             option is not specified, WYLBUR prompts for the value at the
                             terminal.
0            PROMPT='string' specifies a prompt that WYLBUR displays at the terminal
                             instead of the default "Enter>" prompt.  The length of the
                             prompt is limited only by the maximum command length of 235
                             characters.  For example, the command:

0                            at the terminal.  You respond with a USE command that WYLBUR
                             executes before continuing execution of the EXEC file.
0            [USING=]line-number
                             specifies the line in the active file that includes the
                             information to be passed to the EXEC file.  Only one line
                             number can be indicated.  If the EXECUTE option is included
                             with USING, the information is taken from a line number in the
                             EXEC file.  If the USING option is omitted, WYLBUR prompts for
                             the information at the terminal.
0            COLUMNS=m[/n]   specifies that WYLBUR is to read the contents of the columns
                             in the given line number.  If you include both beginning and
                             ending columns, they must be separated by a slash (e.g., 2/5).
                             If you omit the ending column (/n), it is assumed to be the
                             last non-blank character of the text line.
0            DELETE          specifies that after obtaining the contents of the specified
                             line, WYLBUR should delete that line from the active file.
                             Note that this option is cannot be used with the EXECUTE
                             option.
0            EXECUTE         indicates that WYLBUR should get the information from a line
                             in the EXEC file rather than the active file.
0            ATTN=line-number
                             specifies a line number that WYLBUR is to execute next, if the
                             BREAK key is pressed in response to the prompt from the READ
                             command.  Symbolic line numbers are acceptable.  When the ATTN
                             option is not used, pressing BREAK in response to the READ
                             prompt causes an EXEC BREAK.  To cause an EXEC BREAK when
                             using the ATTN option on the READ command, you must respond to
                             the READ prompt by typing a question mark (?) and pressing
                             BREAK.

                             must be specified first.
0            account-options specify the account to recatalog a data set belonging to an
                             account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                             this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                             for a description of the account-options.  If this option is

                             volume.)  TEMPORARY allows you to catalog a data set on a
                             temporary volume (e.g., SCR002).  (You are not charged for
                             data sets saved on temporary volumes.  However, each morning
                             all data sets on those volumes are scratched.)  If the ON

0            The RELEASE command allows you to release a job or a job's output from HOLD
             status (either execution hold or output hold).  A job must be awaiting output
             processing if you wish to RELEASE particular portions of the output.
0            The HOLD command allows you to stop the processing of a job.  Type HELP HOLD
             for a description of this command.

0            jobid           identifies the job(s) to be released.  This option is required
                             and must be specified first.  Type HELP JOBID for a
                             description of the various forms of jobid.
0            MULTIPLE        causes the command to be processed if the jobid matches more
                             than one jobname in the system.  When several jobs are
                             explicitly referred to by number, the MULTIPLE option is not
                             necessary.
0            account-options specify the account to release a job or jobs belonging to an
                             account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                             this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                             for a description of the account-options.  If this option is
                             specified, you will be prompted for the password of the
                             account before the command is executed.
0            queue-options   allow further selection of jobs to be affected by the command.
                             Jobs must be in the specified queue (i.e., EXEC or OUTPUT) to
                             be affected.  Type HELP QUEUE-OPTIONS for a description of
                             these options.
0            output-options  allow you to restrict the effect of the RELEASE command to
                             selected groups of data sets.  OUTPUT is the only valid
                             output-option when the job is awaiting execution.  However, as
                             soon as a job has begun execution, other options may be used.
                             Type HELP OUTPUT-OPTIONS for a description of the
                             output-options.

0            The REPLACE command allows you to replace the contents of the specified range
             in the active file.  WYLBUR prompts with successive line numbers in the range;
             allowing you to type the new contents of each line.  If you reply to a prompt
             by pressing only the RETURN key, WYLBUR replaces that line with a completely
             blank line.  If you specify the DITTO option, WYLBUR prompts you to replace
             only one line and uses the new contents of that line to replace all other
             lines in the range.
0            The short form of the REPLACE command consists of responding to the command
             prompt by typing in a single line number, followed by a blank, and then the
             contents of the line.  When NOSHORT mode is in effect, WYLBUR accepts this
             short form only after a permission prompt.  (Type HELP SET MODES SHORT NOSHORT
             for a description of the SHORT and NOSHORT modes.)  Note that, in this form of
             the REPLACE command, you cannot use the normal abbreviations (L and F) for the
             symbolic line numbers LAST and FIRST.
0            After typing a line that you are replacing, you can type the @ sign and press
             the BREAK key to MODIFY or EDIT that line.  MODIFY or EDIT is selected based
             on the mode in effect.  (Type HELP SET MODES MODIFY EDIT for a description of
             the MODIFY and EDIT modes.)  When you are replacing a line and type @ and
             press the BREAK key as the only response to the line number prompt, you can
             MODIFY or EDIT the "old" copy of the line.  For example:
0               Command> replace 5
                    5.   > This is line five@***
                    5.     This is line five

                             the session case setting.  UPLOW causes WYLBUR to retain the
                             case (upper, lower, or a mixture) of the text replaced.  UPPER
                             causes WYLBUR to convert all lowercase letters to uppercase as

             RETURN (line-number)                                   WYLBUR Reference Manual
0            RETURN is a symbolic line number used in EXEC files in conjunction with the
             SAVE option of the EXECUTE command.  (Type HELP LINE-NUMBER for a description
             of symbolic line numbers.)
0            For example, assume an EXEC file contains the command EXECUTE SAVE at line 11.
             This causes the symbolic line number RETURN to be set to the next line; let's
             assume 12.  Further, assume the command EXECUTE RETURN is at line 20.  This
             would cause the command at the line number RETURN, i.e., line 12, to be
             executed.
0            You can also set the value of RETURN with the command SET RETURN.  If you
             issue SET RETURN without a line number, RETURN will be set to 0.  The SHOW
             RETURN command displays the value of RETURN.

0            The RUN command specifies that all or part of the active or EXEC file, which
             may consist of one or more jobs, be submitted into the job input stream of the
             central computer.
0            All JCL required to run the job must be contained in the file.  The first line
             in the range must be a JOB statement, although the jobname and account may be
             omitted; WYLBUR automatically generates the default values.  If you do not
             specify the jobname, a 1-8 character string used to identify a job, WYLBUR
             generates a jobname consisting of user and group codes of the logged-on user
             and the WYLBUR job number (e.g., ABCGG244, where ABC is the user code, GG is
             the group code and 244 is the WYLBUR job count).  With the exception of
             comment cards and text inside single quotes, WYLBUR converts all JCL
             statements to uppercase when submitting them to the job input stream.

                             being processed, the high-order digit will be truncated.
                             RNUMBERED allows WYLBUR to put line numbers in columns 73-80
                             even if it means replacing text originally in those columns.
                             UNNUMBERED specifies that the WYLBUR line numbers are not to
                             be put in columns 73-80 of the lines when they are submitted.
                             INTEGER has the same meaning as RNUMBERED, except that the
                             line number is an 8-digit integer.  The numbering option for
                             RUN defaults to the option set with the SET JOB command;
                             UNNUMBERED is the default setting for new accounts.  (Type
                             HELP SET JOB NUMBERED UNNUMBERED for a description of NUMBERED
                             and UNNUMBERED.)
0            EJECT=nëNOEJECT EJECT specifies the number of lines to be printed before the
                             page is ejected.  This number must be between 0 and 255.  If
                             EJECT is not specified, a page eject will occur after 60 lines
                             of printing.  NOEJECT permits lines to be printed to the
                             bottom of the page and over the page perforations.  (This
                             option is invalid when using the 3800 printer.)
0            JOBNAME=jobname specifies the complete jobname to be used.  The ID and PREFIX
                             options will be ignored if JOBNAME is specified.
0            PREFIX=prefix   overrides the default prefix (set by SET JOB) when the jobname
                             is generated by WYLBUR.  This option is ignored if the JOBNAME
                             option is also specified.
0            ID={idë'id'}    specifies a character string that will override the ggnnn
                             portion of the WYLBUR-generated jobname.  This jobname has the
                             form uuuggnnn, where uuu is the user code, gg is the group
                             code and nnn is a WYLBUR-generated job number that is
                             incremented each time a job is submitted.  The quoted 'id'
                             form replaces the string ggnnn.  The unquoted id form overlays
                             the string ggnnn character for character from left to right.
                             This option is ignored if the JOBNAME option is also
                             specified.
0            CLASS=jobclass  specifies that the job is to be run in the indicated execution
                             class.  Current values for "jobclass" are:  B, E, P, F, L.
                             Using this option will override any job class specification in
                             the JCL.
0            PRIORITY={pë(p,p)}
                             specifies the priority at which the job is to run.  Valid
                             priorities, in order of increasing priority, are:  LOW,
                             STANDARD, and URGENT.  They may be abbreviated to L, S, U.  If
                             only one value (e.g., PRIORITY=S) is specified, it will apply
                             to the execution of the job.  If two values (e.g.,
                             PRIORITY=(S,U)) are specified, the first value will apply to
                             the execution of the job and the second value to the output of
                             the job.  STANDARD priority is assumed if this option is not

0            BLOCK=block     specifies the time block when the job is to run.  Valid time
                             blocks are:  DAY, EVENING, NIGHT, WEEKEND and ANY.  They may
                             be abbreviated to D, E, N, W and A.  ANY is the default.  If
                             only one block (e.g., BLOCK=W) is specified, it will apply to
                             the execution of the job.  If thwo blocks are specified (e.g.,
                             BLOCK=(N,W)), the first block will abpply to the execution of
                             the job, while the second block will apply to the output of

0            SHORTëNOSHORT   SHORT allows the "short forms" of the DELETE, INSERT, and
                             REPLACE commands to be accepted without warning.  The "short
                             forms" (not to be confused with abbreviations) are expressed
                             as:
0                               line-number [text]
0                            If the line number specified already exists in the active
                             file, the line is deleted (if no text is given) or replaced
                             (if text is given).  If the line number does not already
                             exist, a line with the specified text is inserted.  When
                             NOSHORT, the default, is in effect, WYLBUR accepts those
                             "short forms" only after a permission prompt.  When responding
                             YES or OK to the permission prompt, you can also specify list
                             options.  (Type HELP LIST-OPTIONS for a description of the
                             list options.)
0            ATTNëNOATTN     ATTN, the default, causes pressing BREAK as the only response
                             to a COMMAND prompt to be treated as though you entered
                             COLLECT with no options.  If NOATTN is in effect, pressing
                             BREAK as the only response to a COMMAND prompt causes the
                             COMMAND prompt to be reissued.
0            RETRYëNORETRY   regulate whether automatic command retry mode is in effect.
                             RETRY allows you to enter automatic command retry mode.  This
                             means that whenever a WYLBUR command fails to execute (e.g.,
                             due to a syntax error), WYLBUR will prompt you to modify the
                             command so that it can be resubmitted for execution.  Retry
                             may also be invoked for commands that executed satisfactorily
                             by pressing the RETURN key (only) in response to the COMMAND
                             prompt.  NORETRY is the default.  Even in NORETRY mode it is
                             possible to invoke command retry by typing @ and then pressing
                             the BREAK key in response to the COMMAND prompt.
0            MODIFYëEDIT     is specified with the RETRY option to indicate whether you

0            LISTëNOLIST     changes the default display option for some commands.  LIST
                             mode causes LIST to be the default for DELETE, INSERT,

                             still default to NOLIST.  The CHANGE, LIST, POINT, EDIT, and

0            CLEARëNOCLEAR   CLEAR allows WYLBUR to automatically clear the active file on
                             certain commands (e.g., USE, FETCH, LOGOFF), if you have not
                             made any changes to your active file since issuing a command
                             that sets your change count to zero (e.g., USE, SAVE, MAIL).
                             NOCLEAR, the default, specifies that you will be warned if you
                             try to access another data set or logoff before clearing your
                             active file.
0            WARN=nëNOWARN   If n or more changes have been made to your active file since
                             you issued a command that sets your change count to zero
                             (e.g., USE, SAVE, MAIL), WYLBUR will warn you if you try to
                             clear the active file.  WARN=30 is the default at logon.  The
                             number of typed additions, deletions, replacements, or changes
                             made to the active file is recorded by WYLBUR as the "change"
                             count.  If the value of the change count is equal to or
                             greater than the warn count, WYLBUR issues the messages:
0                               <number> typed changes to your ACTIVE file.
                                Clear ACTIVE (Yes/No)?
0                            A reply of YES or OK clears the active file; otherwise, the
                             CLEAR command is aborted.
0                            If NOWARN is in effect and the WARN option is specified on a
                             given command, WARN overrides NOWARN mode for that command
                             only.
0                            NOWARN turns off WARN mode.  If WARN mode is in effect and the
                             NOWARN option is specified on a given command, NOWARN
                             overrides WARN mode for that command only.

             The available access options are:
0            READ            allows only reading (or executing from) the data set.  FORTRAN

                             observed when reading data sets from a FORTRAN program.
0            DELETE          allows scratching of a data set either from WYLBUR or batch.
                             An entire library must be scratched, not individual members.
                             Does not allow reading or writing the data set.  This access
                             level is especially pertinent for owners of private disks to
                             keep unauthorized data sets off the volume.  (See 
                              for further information.)
0            WRITE           allows reading, writing, or scratching from WYLBUR or batch,
                             with no password required.  When you have WRITE access and
                             enter a SAVE or SCRATCH command for a data set owned by
                             another account, WYLBUR will issue a prompt to verify that
                             access to another user's data set was intended.
0            PASSWORD        allows reading from WYLBUR or batch; allows writing or
                             scratching only if done from WYLBUR and after the data set
                             owner's password is provided (in response to a "Password?"
                             prompt or via a prior SET ACCOUNT gg.uuu PASSWORD command).
                             In batch, PASSWORD access is equivalent to READ access.
                             However, if you have PASSWORD access you may condense a data
                             set using a WYLBUR CONDENSE command.
0            UPDATE          allows reading and writing to, but not scratching of the data
                             set.  With UPDATE access to a library, you may scratch an
                             individual member but not an entire library.
0            NONE            allows no access at all to the data set.

                             EXTEND allows target users to pass on their access privileges

0            The SET TABS command allows you to set logical tabs in WYLBUR whether or not
             your terminal has physical tabs available.  (Check the instruction manual for
             your terminal to see whether or not it has physical tabs and how to set them.)
0            If your terminal does not have physical tabs, you can make use of WYLBUR's tab
             capabilities by adding the NOVERIFY option to the SET TABS command.  NOVERIFY
             suppresses the tab verification lines used to check physical tabs.  When you
             are using tabs to enter text, the cursor (or carriage) will not move to the
             proper location as you press the TAB key (it will move one space or not at
             all).  However, WYLBUR does keep track of the tabs you have set, and when you
             list the collected lines, WYLBUR inserts the multiple blanks as required,
             unless you specify otherwise.  You must SET TERMINAL SLOW if the terminal does
             not have tabs.  (Type HELP SET TERMINAL SLOW FAST for a description of the
             SLOW and FAST terminal settings.)
0            You must ensure that the physical tabs set on your terminal match the logical
             tabs set in WYLBUR.  If you have a Gen-Com 300Q terminal, include the GENCOM
             option on SET TERMINAL to set both physical and logical tabs.  If you have a
             terminal that supports the automatic tab setting feature (such as a DECwriter
             IV), include the AUTO option on SET TERMINAL to set both physical and logical
             tabs.
0            Otherwise, consider the following alternatives for setting tabs.  First, set
             the physical tabs where you want them, then set the logical tabs using the SET
             TABS command.  Specifying the tab positions (e.g., SET TABS 10 20 30 40 50) is
             the fast way of setting tabs; a slower way of setting them is by issuing the
             SET TABS command without options.  WYLBUR lists the column positions and
             prompts you for tab settings.  Begin at the left and space over to each
             successive column in which you want a tab set, then press the SET key on the
             keyboard and type the letter t.  WYLBUR responds by verifying the tab
             positions by typing a t in each column position in which a tab has been set.
0            Once you have set both the physical and logical tabs, the carriage or cursor
             actually moves to the proper location when you press the TAB key.  In
             addition, issuing the command SET TERMINAL FAST allows you to speed up the
             listing of lines with many blanks, since WYLBUR automatically makes use of the
             physical tabs when listing the text.  To change back to the logon default (no
             physical tabs are assumed), issue the command SET TERMINAL SLOW.
0            If you enter more than 16 tab settings, WYLBUR only recognizes the first 16.
             If there is an error in the SET TABS command, WYLBUR rejects the command and
             issues an error message.  If you press the tab key when no tabs have been set,
             WYLBUR issues an error message and does not process the line.
0            The SHOW TABS command allows you to display or verify the current tab
             positions.  The CLEAR TABS command erases the current tabs.

                             specified in ascending order (e.g., 5, 10, 15 rather than 5,
                             15, 10).
0            UNNUMBERED      specifies that the tabs are relative to absolute column 1
                             instead of absolute column 12 (the first column when the line

                             set physical tabs on some terminals.  GENCOM is used to set
                             tabs on the Gen-Com 300Q and similar terminals.  AUTO causes
                             the sequence "ESCAPE 1" (where ESCAPE represents pressing the
                             ESCAPE key) to be typed at each tab stop; this sets tabs on
                             many other types of terminals as well.
0            NOVERIFY        causes WYLBUR to suppress the tab verification lines used to
                             check physical tabs.  NOVERIFY must be specified when setting
                             tabs on a terminal without physical tabs.

                             statement of the job that wrote the first file on the tape.
0            DSNAME=dsname   specifies the new data set name.  The data set name is
                             originally the name of the first data set on the tape.
0            FILES=n         specifies the number of files on the tape (from 1 to 999).
0            INCODE=n        specifies a tape input use code; the valid values are:

+            ___________________
0            ID=tid          specifies the three-character ITS terminal id.
0            type            specifies the terminal type (for example, VT100 for a DEC
                             VT100 terminal).  Type HELP TERMINALS for a list of
                             terminals that are supported in Page WYLBUR.
0            TIMEOUTëNOTIME  TIMEOUT, the logon default, specifies that you will be logged
                             off your terminal after 10 minutes of inactivity.  NOTIME
                             allows you to be inactive for 40 minutes during DAY block, and
                             indefinitely during EVENING, NIGHT, and WEEKEND time blocks,
                             before you are logged off.
0            BREAKëNOBREAK   NOBREAK keeps your typing from being interrupted to receive a
                             message from another user.  Instead, the message will be typed
                             after the input line is completed.  BREAK is the logon
                             default.
0            COMMëNOCOMM     COMM, the logon default, allows you to receive user messages
                             from other logged-on users that are sent via the TO command
                             and to be notified if user messages are sent via the SEND or
                             MAIL commands.  NOCOMM prohibits such messages from being
                             received at the terminal.  Use the NOMSG option if you wish to
                             prohibit any messages (user or system) from being received.
0            MSGëNOMSG       NOMSG prohibits any messages from being received at the
                             terminal.  Even operator and system messages are blocked in
                             this mode.  If you want to block messages from other users
                             (but not the operator) use the NOCOMM option instead.  MSG is
                             the logon default.
0            ECHOëNOECHO     ECHO, the logon default, if you logon through a PDP terminal
                             controller (e.g., class code 20), specifies that the terminal
                             controller echoes the input.  NOECHO, the logon default for
                             the other terminal controllers (e.g., class code 10),
                             specifies that the terminal rather than the terminal

0                            controller echoes the input.  Use the NOECHO option when you
                             see double characters displayed at your terminal during input.
0            IDLES=n         controls the number of idle characters added by the system
                             after the carriage return, line feed, and tab functions, where
                             n can be from 0 to 99.  When n is greater than 1, it is n
                             times the standard idle settings.  The standard idle settings
                             are set with the command SET TERMINAL IDLES=1 (or just SET
                             TERMINAL IDLES) and they are as follows:
0                               IDLES: CRI=20,2 LFI=20 HTI=20,2 CSI=0
0                            The logon default is to have NO idle characters generated.
                             Idle characters are required by some terminals to allow time
                             for the terminal to perform whatever function is required.
                             (The system uses the ASCII "NUL" character as an idle.)
0            CRI=f[,d]       sets the carriage return idles.  f is a fixed delay ranging
                             from 0 to 5000 millisecond.  d is the per character delay,
                             ranging from 0 to 5000 milliseconds.  The standard setting for
                             carriage return idles (i.e., CRI=20,2) can be set with the
                             IDLES option.
0            LFI=f           sets the line feed idles.  f is a fixed delay ranging from 0
                             to 5000 milliseconds.  The standard setting for line feed
                             idles (i.e., LFI=20) can be set with the IDLES option.
0            HTI=f[,d]       sets the horizontal tab idles.  f is a fixed delay ranging
                             from 0 to 5000 millisecond.  d is the per character delay,
                             ranging from 0 to 5000 milliseconds.  The standard setting for
                             horizontal tab idles (i.e., HTI=20,2) can be set with the
                             IDLES option.
0            CSI=f           sets the clear screen idles.  f is a fixed delay ranging from
                             0 to 5000 milliseconds.  The standard setting for clear idles
                             (i.e., CSI=0) can be set with the IDLES option.
0            NOIDLES         resets the number of idle characters generated to zero, the
                             logon default.
0            XONëNOXON       For microprocessor users.  In XON mode, the logon default, the
                             last character of every terminal read prompt is the "XON"
                             (ASCII DC1) control character.  In NOXON mode, no special
                             prompt ending character is added.
0            BACKëNOBACK     BACK allows you to enter the backspace character as data, and
                             CONTROL-X (ASCII CAN) erases the previous character.  In
                             NOBACK mode, the logon default, a backspace character is
                             interpreted as a deletion of the previous character.
0            FASTëSLOW       FAST causes the pre-set tabs to be used (instead of multiple
                             blanks) when listing output lines.  (This speeds up the
                             listing of lines.)  SLOW, the logon default, disables this

0            APLëAPLB        Both the APL and APLB options are used to set up the correct
                             character translation code in order to use the APL language.
                             (When you specify APL or APLB, BACK also goes into effect.)
                             APL sets the terminal for APL following the typewriter pairing
                             of the keys.  The majority of APL terminals follow this
                             layout.  To determine if this is the correct setting for your
                             terminal, look at the symbol above number '0' on the keyboard.
                             If it is a '^' (a caret), then this is the correct
                             translation.  APLB sets the terminal for APL following the
                             bit-paired pairing of the keys.  To determine if this is the
                             correct setting for your terminal, look at the symbol above
                             number '0' on the keyboard.  If it is blank, then this is the
                             correct translation.
0            NOAPLëNOAPLB    NOAPL or NOAPLB resets the translation code from APL or APLB
                             to ASCII (and resets BACK to NOBACK).  NOAPL or NOAPLB are the
                             logon defaults and provide the standard translation.
0            UPPERëUPLOW     In UPPER mode all input text is automatically converted to
                             uppercase, regardless of the case of the text entered in.  In
                             UPLOW mode, the logon default, the case of the input text will
                             not be changed.  To remind you that UPLOW is in effect,
                             WYLBUR's command and line number prompts end with a right
                             angle bracket.  For example:  14. > and Command>.  If UPPER is
                             in effect, WYLBUR's command and line number prompts end with a
                             question mark.
0            WIDTH=n         specifies the width of your terminal line, where n is the
                             number of characters in the line and can be an integer value
                             from 1 to 255.  For most CRT terminals, the width is 80
                             characters.  WIDTH=80 is the logon default.  This option can
                             be used to allow WYLBUR to better format the responses to
                             certain commands (e.g. SHOW USERS) or it can be used in
                             conjunction with SET TERMINAL HEIGHT.
0            HEIGHT=nëNOHEIGHT
                             HEIGHT=n specifies that n is the maximum number of lines to be
                             written to the terminal before a page pause.  n must be an
                             integer value from 0 to 255.  (A page pause means that the
                             system pauses, allowing you to read the information displayed
                             at your terminal.)
0                            After a page pause, you can press the RETURN key to resume the
                             listing of lines.  You can press the BREAK key after a page
                             pause, or during the listing of lines, to interrupt the

                             WIDTH setting at logon is 80 (the correct setting for most CRT
                             terminals).  The SET TERMINAL WIDTH command can be used to

0            TYPEAHEADëNOTYPEAHEAD
                             Both the TYPEAHEAD and NOTYPEAHEAD options are valid only when
                             you logon through the PDP-11 terminal controller (that is,

                             you to enter text before a prompt is sent to the terminal.
                             Thus, you can enter text in collect mode without waiting for
                             the line-number prompt.  NOTYPEAHEAD specifies that any

0            The SET USER command allows you to change the default value of the user code
             so you can access jobs and data sets belonging to an account other than that
             of the logged-on user.  To access jobs and data sets from an account with a
             group code other than that of the logged-on user, you must also use the SET
             GROUP command.  Note that all charges for the session are incurred by the
             logged-on user, regardless of the value of USER or GROUP.
0            You can also use the SET ACCOUNT command to change the default values of the
             USER and GROUP codes.  SHOW USER displays the current value of ACCOUNT (i.e.,
             the user and group codes), as well as the logged-on ACCOUNT.

0            The SET VALUE command allows you to store an expression in a user variable.
             If necessary, WYLBUR evaluates the expression before it is stored.  For
             example, in the command SET VALUE N1=(2+2), the value of N1 would be 4.  The
             SHOW VALUE command displays the value of the expression.  These commands are
             primarily useful in EXEC files.

                             appear on the screen with line numbers.  The screen width is
                             69 characters.  If your active file is empty, about 20 blank
                             lines, each beginning with 'New.', appear on the screen.  This
                             option remains in effect for the terminal session, until you
                             issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with an UNNUMBERED option.
                             UNNUMBERED causes the text in your active file to appear on
                             the screen without line numbers, beginning in the first column
                             of the screen display.  The screen width is usually 80
                             characters.  If the active file is empty, about 20 blank lines
                             without line numbers appear on the screen.  This option
                             remains in effect for the terminal session, until you issue a

0            INDENT={nëAUTO}ëNOINDENT
                             n indents every line 'n' spaces when you press the RETURN key.
                             AUTO indents each new line to the left margin of the previous
                             line when you press the return key.  This automatic
                             indentation mode is convenient for entering tables and block
                             structured programs.  NOINDENT, the default, specifies that
                             each new line begins at the left margin, regardless of the
                             indentation of the previous line.  These options remain in

                             SET VIEW command with an INDENT option.
0            MARGIN=n        sets the right hand margin of your VIEW screens to the column
                             'n'.  This is useful if you work with lines longer or shorter
                             than 69 columns.  This margin will remain for the terminal
                             session, until you issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with a
                             different margin length.

                             issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with a NOINSERT option.
                             NOINSERT, the default, puts you in overstrike mode at the
                             start of any VIEW session, so that you can type over text.
                             This remains in effect for the terminal session, until you

0            The SHOW CHARGES command displays information about the charges accrued to
             your account as of the last time the accounting programs were run (usually
             between midnight and 6 a.m. each day).
0            The SHOW CHARGES command response includes the month-to-date charges, as well
             as the year-to-date charges.  The date when the charges were last calculated
             is also shown along with the dollar amount added at that time.  In addition,
             if the account has been suspended the reason appears in the response (e.g.,
             expired, over budget).  For LCIP accounts, the number of interactive hours
             used and the number of hours allowed are shown (NOT including time used in
             current session).
0            The SHOW AMESSAGE (or SHOW AMSG) command displays any accounting message that
             appears in the SHOW CHARGES command response.

                             as a negative response and WYLBUR lists the next data set

0            The USE command copies a data set saved on a disk volume into the active file.
             The active file must be cleared.  To access the data set without clearing the
             active file, use the COPY...FROM command.  The USE command also sets the
             PREFIX to the specified dsname.  (Type HELP SET PREFIX for a description of

0            dsname          is the name of the data set to be copied into the active file.
                             This option is required and must be specified first.
0            account-options specify the account to use a data set belonging to an
                             account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                             this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                             for a description of the account-options.
0            ON volume       indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                             located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)  If
                             this option is not specified, WYLBUR searches the system
                             catalog for the data set name and its volume location.  If the
                             data set is not cataloged, WYLBUR will use the volume set with
                             the SET VOLUME command.
0            format-options  allow you to specify the record length and the treatment of
                             WYLBUR line numbers in the data set to be used.  (Type HELP
                             FORMAT-OPTIONS for a description of these options.)

                             put in the active file).
0            COUNT=n         causes only n lines (starting at the beginning of the file) to
                             be copied into the active file.
0            CLEAR           erases the current active file (if any) before copying the
                             specified data set.  If the active file is not empty and CLEAR
                             is not specified, WYLBUR will prompt for permission to clear
                             the active file.
0            NOWARN          when specified with the CLEAR option, overrides WARN mode, the

0            The VIEW command allows you to enter Page WYLBUR (Page mode).  In Page mode,
             you can edit a page (an entire screen) of text, seeing the changes as you make
             them.  (In WYLBUR Line mode, text is displayed on the screen but you cannot
             change it directly.)
0            If your active file is empty when you issue a VIEW command, about 20 blank
             lines (depending on your terminal) appear on your screen, ready for you to
             enter text.  If you have text in your active file, the first 20 lines of the
             file appear on the screen (unless you specify a range option.)
0            You can use the VIEW command with a range option to indicate the specific
             lines in your active file that you want to appear in the screen display.  In
             addition, issuing VIEW with its other options allows you to specify various
             Page mode functions.  You can also use the SET VIEW command to specify the
             Page mode functions.  Typing SHOW VIEW displays the Page mode functions
             currently in effect.
0            You can press the BREAK key at any time to leave Page mode and return to line
             mode.  If you leave Page mode, and later return without having cleared your
             active file, the same portion of the text appears in the screen display.

                             different margin length.
0            WRAPëNOWRAP     WRAP, the default, causes the cursor and text to automatically
                             move to the beginning of the next line when you are entering
                             or editing text in Page mode and reach the right margin of the
                             screen.  This option remains in effect for the terminal
                             session, until you issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with a
                             NOWRAP option.  NOWRAP specifies that you must press the
                             RETURN key to begin a new line of text in Page mode.  This
                             option remains in effect for the terminal session, until you
                             issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with a WRAP option.
0            INSERTëNOINSERT
                             INSERT puts you in insert mode at the start of any VIEW
                             session.  This option is helpful if you prefer working in
                             insert mode to working in the default overstrike mode.  This
                             option remains in effect for the terminal session, until you
                             issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with a NOINSERT option.
                             NOINSERT, the default, puts you in overstrike mode at the
                             start of any VIEW session, so that you can type over text.
                             This remains in effect for the terminal session, until you
                             issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with an INSERT option.
0            SPELLëNOSPELL   SPELL makes the speller check your text for spelling errors as
                             you enter it, and highlights any possibly misspelled words.
                             Type HELP SPELL for more information on the speller.  This
                             option remains in effect for the terminal session, until you
                             issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with a NOSPELL option.
                             NOSPELL, the default, causes the speller to not check your
                             text for spelling errors unless you issue the SPELL command
                             from the command line.  This option remains in effect for the
                             terminal session, until you issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW
                             command with a SPELL option.

0            The term volume refers to a valid external storage disk used to store both
             WYLBUR and other system data sets.  To obtain a list of the available volumes,
             issue the SHOW VOLUMES command and WYLBUR responds with a description like the
             following:
0            Public volumes:
               PUB001 PUB002 PUB003 PUB004 PUB005 PUB006 PUB007 PUB008 PUB009 PUB010 PUB011
               PUB012 PUB013 PUB014 PUB015 PUB016 PUB017 PUB018 PUB019 PUB020 PUB021 PUB022
               PUB023 PUB024 PUB025 PUB026 PUB027 PUB028 PUB029 PUB030

0            Temporary volumes:
               SCR002
0            "Public volumes" may be used to save permanent data sets.  "Use only volumes"
             contain data sets that can be displayed; however, data sets cannot be saved on
             these volumes.  "Temporary volumes" (also called scratch volumes) can be used
             for the storage of temporary data sets.  Data sets saved on a temporary volume
             are scratched overnight.

0            The WRITE command allows you to display an expression.  It is most useful in
             EXEC files for displaying various results during the execution of the file or
             information about the EXEC file to the person who is executing it.
0            See the  		   for more information on writing EXEC files.
0            Option Descriptions
+            ___________________
0            expression      specifies the expression to be displayed.  You can specify any
                             valid expression (e.g., WRITE (2+2) or WRITE 'Hello').
0            NONL            means "no new line" and specifies that WYLBUR is to display
                             the expression without issuing a new line (i.e., carriage
                             return or line feed).  Either the command prompt or the next
                             information to be displayed will appear on the same line as
                             the expression.
0            ATTN=line-number
                             specifies a line-number WYLBUR is to execute next, if whoever
                             is using the EXEC file presses the BREAK key to interrupt the
                             WRITE command.  Symbolic line numbers are acceptable.  If the
                             ATTN option is not used, this condition causes an EXEC BREAK.
                             As a safeguard against having an EXEC file that cannot be
                             interrupted, the ATTN option will not be honored when the
                             BREAK key is pressed more than once.

-            WYLBUR keeps track of changes to your active  file and warns you of the number
             of changes  made if  you try  to clear  the active  file.   For  example,  the
             command:
0                 SET MODES WARN=5
0            sets the flag so that,  after 5  changes,  WYLBUR issues a warning (WARN=30 is
             the default at logon).  To turn off the warning mode, type:
0                 SET MODES NOWARN
0            You can override the  warning mode setting by specifying WARN  or NOWARN as an
             option on any command that clears the active file.
0            WYLBUR updates the change count on completed commands as follows:

-            Many utility functions can be performed  through the use of prepackaged WYLBUR
             programs called EXEC files.   For example,  using EXEC files you can copy data
             sets to tape, or format a document with SCRIPT (a text formatter).   Following
             is a list of  some of the most frequently used EXEC  files contained in public
             libraries,  including a description  of the function of each.   To  use one of
             these EXEC files, issue the command:
0               UTIL execfile
0            where "execfile" is one of the member names listed below.
