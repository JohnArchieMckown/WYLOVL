SUNet is the Stanford University Network.  To use:

   enter 121 in response to the "class code" prompt at logon
   press RETURN key twice.

The cursor should move down two lines and give you the following
prompt:

   TIP-ITS#__  Welcome to SUNet.  Enter host name:

You should then enter the code for the computer you want to access.

The DEC 2060-type computers at Stanford on SUNet are:

   GSB-WHY         (Graduate School of Business)
   GSB-HOW         (Graduate School of Business)
   LOTSA           (LOTS machine A)
   LOTSB           (LOTS machine B)
   Score           (Computer Science Department)
   SU-SCORE.ARPA   (Computer Science Department)
   Sierra          (Electrical Engineering)
   SU-SIERRA.ARPA  (Electrical Engineering)
   SAIL            (Artificial Intelligence Laboratory)
   SU-AI.ARPA      (Artificial Intelligence Laboratory)
   SUMEX           (medical research only)
   SUMEX-AIM.ARPA  (medical research only)

SRI International also has a computer on SUNet:

   SRI-AI
   SRI-AI.ARPA

The Stanford VAX/UNIX computers on the network include:

   Diablo          (HPP, Distributed systems, VISI Theory)
   Shasta          (Center for Integrated Systems)
   Tahoma          (Stanford Psychology)
   SU-PSYCH        (Stanford Psychology)
   Tamalpais       (Information Systems Laboratory)
   ISL             (Information Systems Laboratory)
   SU-ISl          (Information Systems Laboratory)
   Whitney         (Stanford Robotics)

If you have an account on one of these computers, you can send mail
to accounts on the other computers.  You can also use the TELNET
program when you are logged on one computer to connect to another.

Several of these computers are involved in ARPANet (Advanced Research
Projects Agency); "ARPANet Directory", a directory of the network, is
published by the Network Information Center at SRI International.
