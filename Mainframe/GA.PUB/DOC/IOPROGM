*12/06/90  New Version of IOPROGM

A new version of the IOPROGM data set utility has been installed.
This is the version that was previously available as VERSION=TEST.
A new manual that documents this version is available via the PUBLISH
command.

The TAPECOPY and TAPESNIF procedures use IOPROGM and are also
affected by this change.

If you have any problems with the new version, please report them
by using the CONSULT command, or send mail to GA.MCL@FORSYTHE.
You can access the old version by coding VERSION=BACK on your
EXEC statement when running IOPROGM, TAPECOPY, or TAPESNIF.

The changes in the new version are summarized below.

Changes to Commands and Options

New commands and options have been added, and several old ones have
been removed.  In addition, some old commands are being phased out,
that is, they are still accepted but will be removed at a later
date.

The following old options are obsolete:

INVOLCHECK        Has been removed; use the VOLCHECK option instead.

OUTVOLCHECK       Has been removed; changes in the system's handling
                  of output tapes have rendered it unworkable (this
                  option controlled whether to accept a substitute
                  output tape when a specific volume was requested
                  and rejected; such substitutions are no longer
                  made).

NOIBMASCII        Is still accepted but will cause a warning message
                  to be printed.  It was used to suppress automatic
                  ASCII translation of tapes with ANSI labels on
                  both input and output.  You can now control this
                  with the INCODE and OUTCODE options.

INEDIT            Has been removed; it was obsolescent in Release
                  3.3 of IOPROGM.  You can suppress recognition of
                  EDIT format by using the INFORMAT option.

OUTEDIT           Has been removed; it was obsolescent in Release
                  3.3 of IOPROGM.  You can control use of EDIT for-
                  mat on output with the OUTFORMAT option.

NUMBERS           Has been removed; it was replaced by the
                  INTEGER/NOINTEGER option in Release 3.3 of
                  IOPROGM.

CHAIN             Has been removed; it was replaced by the CHARS
                  option in Release 3.3 of IOPROGM.

The following new options have been added:

DELTA          is used to control the line-numbering increment when
               converting unnumbered input files to EDIT format or
               sequence-numbered formats.

ERRDUMP        requests that bad blocks (input data blocks with
               hardware-detected errors) be dumped on SYSPRINT.

ERROR          specifies handling of input I/O errors; it replaces
               the EROPT subparameter of the DCB parameter on the
               input DD statement.

INBLKSIZE      can be used to specify the BLKSIZE of the input data
               set; it replaces the BLKSIZE subparameter of the DCB
               parameter on the input DD statement.

INCODE         specifies a character translation for the input file.
               It replaces the IBMASCII option, and the OPTCD=Q DCB
               subparameter.  However, it also makes new code trans-
               lations available, and allows translation of data
               read from disk (OPTCD=Q is valid only for tapes with
               ANSI labels or no labels).

INPREFIX       specifies a block prefix for variable-length records
               on ASCII tapes; it replaces the BUFOFF DCB subparame-
               ter.

MEMBERS        is used to select members from a partitioned data set
               (library).

DENSITY        specifies the recording density of the output tape;
               it replaces the DEN DCB subparameter.  OUTDENSITY is
               an alias for DENSITY.

OUTCODE        specifies a character translation for the output
               file.  It replaces the IBMASCII option (which applied
               to both input and output), and the OPTCD=Q DCB sub-
               parameter.  However, it also makes new code transla-
               tions available, and allows translation of data writ-
               ten to disk (OPTCD=Q is valid only for tapes with
               ANSI labels or no labels).

OUTPREFIX      specifies a block prefix for variable-length records
               on ASCII tapes; it replaces the BUFOFF DCB subparame-
               ter.  Support for a block prefix other than a 4-byte
               length has been added.

PUNCH='text'   writes a text string to SYSPUNCH.

NAMEGEN        generates data set names for files read from unla-
               beled tape, based on the dsname supplied on the DD
               statement and the file sequence number.

DJDETEXT       constructs a Dynamic Job Descriptor Entry (DJDE) for
               the Xerox 4090-series printers.

DUMPFORMAT     specifies the format of DUMP output; formats
               HEXADECIMAL and DUAL have been added.

DUMPRDW        when dumping V-format records, includes the Record
               Descriptor Word (RDW) in the dump as part of the
               data, for consistency with IBM utilities.

DUPLEX         when printing duplex on Xerox 4090-series printers,
               forces each report to the front side of a page.

OPTIONS        controls reporting of IOPROGM option settings.

ABEND          can be used to force IOPROGM to abnormally terminate
               (ABEND).

IF             conditionally executes a command.

THEN           conditionally executes a command, based on the last
               IF test.

ELSE           conditionally executes a command, based on the last
               IF test.


FILESEQ Default Changed

The default value for FILESEQ is now always CONTINUE.  In Release
3.3, the default was either CONTINUE or DD, depending on the value
of NFILES.


Other Changes

In addition to the changes in options listed above, numerous
improvements have been made in IOPROGM processing.  These include:

*   ASCII tape handling has been improved; in particular, it is now
    possible to write D-format (ASCII variable) records without
    translation.  F-format blocks that have been padded (for exam-
    ple, to the word size of the creating machine) can be read when
    ERROR=ACCEPT is specified.

*   IOPROGM now protects against over-writing tape files created
    earlier in the IOPROGM job step, even if a different DD state-
    ment was used.

*   Support for 3480 tapes has been added.

*   Messages are now in upper and lower case for better readability.
    However, data set summary messages on SYSTERM have not been
    changed, since these are often processed by programs.
