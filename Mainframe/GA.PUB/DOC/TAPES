Subject:  JOB CANCELLED awaiting TAPE(s) to be RETRIEVED from ARCHIVE

Your job has been CANCELLED and placed in OUTPUT HOLD as it requires
one or more tapes which are currently located at Archive storage.
To retrieve tapes so that your job can be executed, you must first
check all tapes required by job to determine which one(s) are at
Archive (i.e.  LOCATION=80 or 82).  For each tape at Archive, you
should then issue a SET TAPE command with the RETRIEVE option.  This
action will cause tapes to be requested to be returned from ARCHIVE
within 2 full working days (weekends/holidays excluded).  You may
verify that tape(s) have returned to FORSYTHE by using the SHOW TAPE
command for each required tape.  When the LOCATION=10 for each
tape(s), then job may be resubmitted.

If you need assistance with the SHOW TAPE and SET TAPE commands,
issue the HELP SHOW TAPE or HELP SET TAPE command respectively.  For
additional assistance, contact the Information Desk at 723-4392.

Note: In general, we recommend that you verify that all tapes
      required for a job are at Forsythe before submitting job.
      This practice will avoid any unforseen delays due to tapes
      having to be subsequently retrieved from ARCHIVE.
