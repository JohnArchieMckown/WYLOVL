Title:  Shift Routines for Fullword Operands

Library Program Number:  C027

Subprogram name(s):  SHF1RA, SHF1LA, SHF1RL, SHF1LL, SHF1RC, SHF1LC

Summary:  These routines provide the FORTRAN programmer with the
          capability of performing arithmetic, logical, and circular
          shifts of any number of binary positions on any fullword
          operand.

Field of application:  Character manipulation, shifting

Search key:  Character manipulation, shifting

Languages from which this routine may be called:  FORTRAN IV;
                                                  Assembler; OS/360

Principal source language:  OS/360 Assembler Language

Secondary source language:  None

Type of routine:  Standard OS/360 closed reentrant integer-type
                  function subprogram

Machine on which routine will execute:  IBM System/360

Monitor or operating system required:  None

Special machine requirements:  None

Call:  ANS = SHF1$$(ARG,NBR) (see under USE for a description of the
       two letters to be substituted for $$)

Parameters:

     Parameter     Type                   Description

       ARG      any fullword         the operand to be shifted
                (4 bytes)

      NBR       fullword integer     the number of binary positions
                                     to be shifted.  If NBR is
                                     negative, the shift will be in
                                     the opposite direction from that
                                     specified in the call.

Declarations:  SHF1RA, SHF1LA, SHF1Rl, SHF1LL, SHF1RC, and SHF1LC
               must be declared integer.  The result is returned in
               general register 0, and register 1 is not preserved.

Use:  To perform a shift of NBR binary positions on the argument
      ARG, use the following:

         Arithmetic Right Shift:  ANS = SHF1RA(ARG,NBR)
         Arithmetic Left Shift:   ANS = SHF1LA(ARG,NBR)
         Logical Right Shift:     ANS = SHF1RL(ARG,NBR)
         Logical Left Shift:      ANS = SHF1LL(ARG,NBR)
         Circular Right Shift:    ANS = SHF1RC(ARG,NBR)
         Circular Left Shift:     ANS = SHF1LC(ARG,NBR)

      for a discussion of the properities of Arithmetic and Logical
      Shifts, refer to the IBM System/360 Principles of Operation,
      form A22-6821.
      labeling the end of each decade, if this annotation is desired.

Other input:  None

Other output:  None

Error conditions and messages:  A fixed-point overflow condition may
                                be generated during Arithmetic Left
                                Shift.  These are handled by the
                                operating system, and this routine
                                takes no action.

Accuracy:  For circular shifts, all bits are retained.  For logical
           shifts and arithmetic shifts, see REFERENCE below.

Time:  Approximately 60 microseconds on Model 50.

Non-library routines or subroutines required:  NOne
                                               routine.

Library routines or subroutines required:  SIN, COS, ISIGN, ALOG10,
                                           INT, ABS, IABS

Library routines required:  None

Storage requirements:  150   =  336   bytes
                          16       10

Registers used:  Standard OS/360 conventions; general register 1 is
                 destroyed
