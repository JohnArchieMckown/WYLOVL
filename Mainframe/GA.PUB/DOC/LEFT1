                               LEFT1

ALIAS OR ENTRY POINT NAMES:  LEFT1, LEFT1A

DESCRIPTION:
This subroutine will find the time left for this job step.  (For
difference timing or controlled termination.) It will also indicate
to a job that an operator STOP command has been directed to it.
When the operator issues a STOP command, the next call to LEFT1 will
return a "time remaining" of zero.  Subsequent calls, however, will
return the "normal" (non-zero) time remaining.

USE:

From FORTRAN:

To obtain the time left in the job step in hundredths of a second,
stored as a fullword integer:

   INTEGER*4 N
   CALL LEFT1(N)

To obtain the time left in the job step in seconds, stored as a short
floating-point number:

   REAL*4 T
   CALL LEFT1A(T)

From PL/I:

To obtain the time left in the job step in hundredths of a second,
stored as a FIXED BINARY(31) integer:

   DECLARE LEFT1 ENTRY(FIXED BIN(31)), N FIXED BIN (31);
   CALL LEFT1(N);

To obtain the time left in the job step in seconds, stored as a
FLOAT DECIMAL(6) floating-point number:

   DECLARE LEFT1A ENTRY(FLOAT DEC(6)), T FLOAT DEC(6);
   CALL LEFT1A(T);
