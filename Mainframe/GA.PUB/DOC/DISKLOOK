DISKLOOK is a utility program that lists information from the
Volume Table Of Contents (VTOC) of one or more disk volumes.  It can
be used to list the names and attributes of data sets belonging to
one or more accounts, to list information about free space on a
volume, and to map the space assignments on a volume.  It is used by
the BACKUP utility to obtain data set information.

If DISKLOOK is invoked with no options specified, it will list all
data sets belonging to the account which ran the job invoking it,
and will do so for all PUB volumes (except PUBC volumes), plus all
SYS, INT, OPS, LIB, and SCR volumes.

Specifying Volumes to be Searched

The VOL and EXVOL parameters specify volumes to be searched and
volumes to be excluded, respectively.  Each may specify a single
volume, a generic volume, or a list.  A six-character volume name is
a specific volume; for example, VOL=PUBT10.  A shorter volume name is
a generic volume; for example, VOL=PUB specifies all volumes
beginning PUB, such as PUBC61, PUB123, PUBT10, etc.  VOL=ALL means
all volumes on the system (except those excluded by EXVOL).
Currently there are over 200 volumes on the system, so this should be
used with caution.

The STORAGE option will do all storage volumes (the SYSA PUB vols
plus SCR002).  If VOL and STORAGE are both coded, storage volumes
plus those selected by VOL will be processed.  If EXVOL is coded but
VOL is not, VOL=ALL is assumed.  If both VOL and EXVOL are coded,
only the volumes selected by VOL (and not excluded by EXVOL) are
processed.

If none of VOL, EXVOL, and STORAGE are coded, STORAGE is assumed.
However, the cataloged procedure has a default VOL list of
(PUB,SYS,INT,LIB,OPS,SCR).  Code a null value for VOL to override this.


An exclude overrides an include, except that a specific volume
include overrides a generic exclude.  Some examples:

VOL=PUB,EXVOL=PUBC        Do all PUB vols except PUBC vols.
VOL=PUB,EXVOL=PUBT10      Do all PUB vols except PUBT10.
VOL=PUB,EXVOL=(PUBC,PUBT10)  Do all PUB vols except PUBCxx and PUBT10.
VOL=INT001,STORAGE        Do PUB vols, SCR002, and INT001

Specifying Which Data Sets to List

You can use the ACC parameter to specify the account(s) for which
data sets are to be listed.  This item may take any of the following
forms:

gg           A two-character group code; all data sets qualified by
             WYL.gg will be listed.

uuu          A three-character user code; all data sets qualified by
             WYL.gg.uuu will be listed, where "gg" is the current
             group code (the one under which the job is running,
             except as noted below).

gg.uuu  or   A full account code; data sets qualified by
uuu$gg       WYL.gg.uuu will be listed.

any other    The string is used unchanged as a "node" or data set
             qualifier.  Data sets qualified by this string are
             listed.

Up to 10 "account" items may be specified by enclosing them in
parentheses, separated by commas.  If some items specify group codes
then the "current" group code mentioned above is the last one
specified before the "user code" in question.  For example:

  //  JOB XY.Z99
  //  EXEC DISKLOOK,ACC='(A00,B01,Z99,XZ.Z13,Z69)'

This job would list data sets belonging to XY.A00, XY.B01, XY.Z99,
XZ.Z13, and XZ.Z69.

  //  JOB
  //  EXEC DISKLOOK,ACC=XY

This job will list all data sets belonging to group XY.

The account list may be preceded by a "not" sign (~), in which case
data sets NOT qualified by any of the listed accounts will be
listed.  This is useful for checking private disk volumes for
"interlopers".  For example, suppose that private pack INT123 is
used by group YY and also by account YZ.A07; then the following job
would list data sets not belonging:

  //  JOB
  //  EXEC DISKLOOK,VOL=INT123,
  //  ACC='~(YY,YZ.A07)'


OTHER OPTIONS

The cataloged procedure contains symbolic parameters for the ACC,
VOL, and EXVOL options; other options may be specified by the OPTION symbolic
parameter.  For example,

  //  EXEC DISKLOOK,VOL=SYS104,OPTION='STORAGE'

Some of the other options are:

NODE=list        Specified that data sets qualified by the given
                 node (or nodes) are to be listed.  As with ACC, up
                 to 10 nodes may be specified; if NODE is specified,
                 any ACC item is ignored.  The difference between
                 NODE and ACC is that NODE items are not translated,
                 but are used "as is".

FREE             List free areas on the volume.

DSN (default)    List data set names.

TERM (default)   Produce a condensed listing on the SYSTERM data set
                 (this is the data set read by BACKUP).

STAT (default)   Print statistics (number of data sets found, etc.)
                 for each volume.

THDR (default)   Print a "header" message identifying the volume at
                 the beginning of each volume's listing on SYSTERM.

KB               Print the data set size in kilobytes on each
                 SYSTERM record.

If you specify the options TERM, NOTHDR, NOFREE, and NOSTAT, the
SYSTERM data set can be easily used for further processing, since it
will contain only data set entries.  You could add the NOPRINT option
if you did not want a printed listing as well.

Each data set record on SYSTERM includes the volume serial of the
data set.

If you want to limit volumes by using your own volume DD statements,
add them to your JCL and specify DYNAMIC=NODYNAMIC on the EXEC
statement.
