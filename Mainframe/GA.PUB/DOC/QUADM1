Title:  Multiple Integration of a Real Function of N Variables by
        Product Rule Quadrature

Library Program Number:  C013

Subprogram name(s):  QUADM1

Summary:  The function subprogram QUADM1 approximates the multiple
form the form by repeating the quadrature rule supplied a specified
number of times for each integration (i.e., producing a product
quadrature rule).  The lower and upper limit functions and the
integrands are supplied by REAL FUNCTION subprograms.

Field of application:  Mathematics

Search key:  Integration, Quadrature

Languages from which this routine may be called:  FORTRAN IV;
                                                  Assembler

Principal source language:  OS/360 FORTRAN IV (H)

Type of routine:  Standard OS/360 FORTRAN IV (H) real function
subprogram

Machine on which routine will execute:  IBM System/360

Monitor or operating system required:  OS/360

Special machine requirements:  Floating-point feature

Call:  Z = QUADM1(NDIMEN, FUNCT, LOWER, UPPER, NPTS, PT, WT, REP)

Parameters:

     Parameter     Type                   Description

     KIND       full word integer    the number of dimensions of
                                     integration

     FUNCT      real function        a subprogram to define the
                short precision      integrands

     LOWER,     real variables       subprograms to define the
     UPPER      short precision      limits of integration

     NPTS       full word integer    the number of points in the
                                     quadrature rule

     PT,WT      real arrays          the abscissas and weights of the
                short precision      given quadrature rule

     REP        full word integer    the number of times the
                                     quadrature rule is to be
                                     repeated for the J-th integral

Declarations:  EXTERNAL FUNCT, LOWER, UPPER
REAL SUBFUNCTION subprograms for FUNCT, LOWER, UPPER

Special system control cards needed:  None

Use:  The REAL FUNCTION QUADM1 approximate the NDIMEN dimension
integral of the integrand functions FUNCT(J,X) between the limits
given by the functions LOWER(J,X) and UPPER(J,X) where X is the array
of integration variables X(1),X(2),...,X(NDIMEN).  X(1) is the
integration variables of the outer most integral.  The NPTS point
quadrature rule defined on the interval [-1,1] with abscissas
PT(1),...,PT(NPTS) and corresponding weights WT(1),...,WT(NPTS) is
repeated REP(J) times for the J-th integral.

The arguments for the REAL FUNCTIONS FUNCT, LOWER and UPPER are
(J,X).

Other input:  None

Other output:  None

Error conditions and messages:  None

Accuracy:  Depends on the integrands and the quadrature rule (and
the number of repetitions).  In QUADM1 the summation are done in long
precision.

Time:  Primarily determined by FUNCT, LOWER and UPPER.

Non-library routines or subroutines required:  REAL FUNCTION
subprograms to define the integrand, upper and lower limits of
integration.

Library routines required:  EXP

Storage requirements:  QUADM1   7BE   bytes
                                   16
                        XP 16   11E1bytes(hex)

Registers used:  Standard OS/360 FORTRAN IV (H) Conventions

Program Description:  The subprogram is a transliteration of the
ALGOL 60 procedure to FORTRAN IV (H) with the names of most variables
changed to be more mnemonic.

X(  )          The array of integration variables.
WIDTH(J)       The length of the interval for applying the
                 quadrature rule once for the J-th integral.
PTMID(J)       The midpoint of the interval.
RESLT(J)       Long precision summand for the J-th integral.
KPTS(J)        Quadrature point counter
IREP(J)        Repetion counter

Comment cards in the subprogram describe the action.
