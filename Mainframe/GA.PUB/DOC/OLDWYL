*02/23/86  NEW VERSION OF WYLBUR SUPPORTS MULTIPLE ACTIVE FILES

A major new version of WYLBUR will be installed March 1, 1986.
Among its many new features, this new WYLBUR will support multiple
active files.  This lets you work on several active files at one
time and move or copy text between active files.  EXEC files can
also use temporary active files instead of clearing existing active
files.

You can open a new active file in several ways:

   1. CLEAR your current active file.  This opens a new
      active file after clearing your current one.
   2. Answer KEEP or K to the "OK to Clear" prompt.  This keeps your
      current active file in an active file stack and opens a
      new empty one.
   3. Specify KEEP on a command that normally takes a
      CLEAR option:  USE, COLLECT, FETCH, etc.

You can switch between active files in several ways:

   1. Type PICK PREVIOUS to select the previous active file
      or PICK NEXT to select the next.
   2. Type UNCLEAR to pick the last cleared active file.
   3. Type SHOW ACTIVES to display your active files,
      and then PICK the desired active file using its number.

NEW COMMANDS:
The SHOW ACTIVES (or SHOW ACTS) command displays a list of your
active files.  Each active file has an associated number and name.
Some have titles (usually where the file came from).  The ALL
option displays all active files, including those that have been
cleared.  REVERSE displays them in reverse order.

       SHOW ACTIVES [ALL] [REVERSE]

The SHOW ACTIVE command displays the name and number of your current
active file. (In Page mode, this information is displayed on the top
line of the screen.)  You can also display information on a
particular active file by specifying its number on the command.

       SHOW ACTIVE [n]

Most commands that accept CLEAR now also accept KEEP as an option
(for example, USE, FETCH, and COLLECT.) The KEEP option keeps the
current active file and opens up a new one.

The CLEAR ACTIVE command and the CLEAR option on other commands now
clear the current active file and open up a new one.

The CLEAR ACTIVES command clears all of your active files.  Your
active files must all be cleared before you can logoff.

The OPEN command opens a new active file and keeps your current
active file.  You can also assign a name and title to the active
file, for your own reference.

       OPEN [name [TITLE='descriptive text']]

The CLOSE command closes an active file, clearing its contents, and
returns you to the previous active file.  OPEN and CLOSE
are useful for EXEC files that need a temporary active file.

The SET ACTIVE command sets a name and optional title to your
current active file:

       SET ACTIVE [n] {[NAME=name] [TITLE='descriptive text']}

EXAMPLES

1.  If you are editing one file and decide you want to make a quick
    change to another file, you should:

         Command> USE filename KEEP

    Make any editing changes, and then type

         Command> PICK PREVIOUS

    to return to the first file.

2.  If you type the CLEAR ACTIVE command (or otherwise clear your
    active file) and realize that you've made a mistake, type the
    command:

         Command> UNCLEAR

    This restores the previously CLEARed active file and
    keeps the current active file.

3.  If you want to copy some text from one active file to another,
    you should first select the active file with the text you want
    to copy:

      Command> SHOW ACTIVES
         1    JAN86  From REPORT#JAN86         127 lines
         2    NEW    Newly collected text       15 lines
      => 3    STATS  From LIB#STATS             86 lines (40 changes)
      Command> PICK 1

    Mark the block you want to copy using the Page mode ESC
    command sequences.  Then select the file you want to move the
    text to:

      Command> PICK 3

    Move or copy the text with the Page mode ESC M or ESC C
    commands.


*02/23/86  NEW EDITING AND FORMATTING OPTIONS

The new version of WYLBUR to be installed March 1st, 1986, has an
easy-to-use set of formatting options which let you display text in
bold, italics and underlined format.  The formatting options can be
specified anywhere in your text.

This will work on text shown on your terminal (e.g., the LIST
command).  It will also work with the text you print with the PRINT
and LPRINT commands.  If your terminal does not support any of these
characteristics, the sequences are ignored.

The sequences are as follows (you must put angle brackets (<>)
around each one:

       .B+ Start Bold            .B- Stop Bold
       .I+ Start Italics         .I- Stop Italics
       .U+ Start Underlining     .U- Stop Underlining
       .F+ Start Flashing        .F- Stop Flashing
              (terminals only)

       .PAGE  Begin a new page (put this by itself on a line)
       .NORMAL Resets all formatting options

For example, your input might include "< .B+ > Text to be bold
< .B- >" without the spaces between the sequence and the bracket.

Note:  ".I+" means italics for PRINT and inverse-video for LIST
(since most terminals do not have italic characters).  The italics
function does not work on the 3800 printer (FORMS=1181 or 9511).

To actually see the sequences (instead of their effects) you must
issue the command:

       LIST UNFORMATTED   or   PRINT UNFORMATTED

You are in "UNFORMATTED" mode whenever you MODIFY or VIEW text.


*02/23/86  NEW COMMANDS AND OPTIONS

The following commands and options will be available in WYLBUR
starting March 1st, 1986.

PAGE MODE EDITING
OOPS Function:  A new Oops function in Page WYLBUR undoes the last
changes to a line.  To use it, type the Oops key (F9 on most
terminals) or the "ESC o" key sequence.  The last version of the
line replaces the current version.  This is a toggle function.  The
Oops function operates on one line at a time, and cannot work on
lines that have been deleted.

Indentation:  Page WYLBUR now word wraps to the left margin or
indentation value.  This means that INDENT=AUTO (on the VIEW or SET
VIEW commands) now works as one would expect.

Window Commands:  The following Page mode commands have been added
or changed:

     ESC W U     Switches between numbered and unnumbered viewing
                 (toggle) -- previously ESC W N
     ESC W N     PICK next active file
     ESC W P     PICK previous active file

WORKING WITH OS FILES:
Block size restrictions lifted:  Previous versions of WYLBUR have
been unable to USE or SAVE files with block sizes greater than 6447
bytes.  There is no longer any limitation on block size.

New SHOW DSNAMES option:  The new INTERNAL option on the SHOW
DSNAMES command returns the SPACE, TYPE, and DATED information  in
fixed field positions.  The display is the same as that returned
from the EXEC file function DSNINFO.

OTHER CHANGES:
Set your own Command prompt:  The SET CPROMPT 'prompt-string'
command lets you define your own WYLBUR command prompt.  The SET
TERSE and SET VERBOSE commands will be phased out.

New SHOW DEFINED option:  The "SHOW DEFINED LIKE string" command
displays all the defined commands starting with the specified
string.  (This change was originally implemented at Iowa State.)

New SET AUTO Command Options:  A new option has been added to the
SET AUTO command.  Its form is:

     SET AUTO COMMAND='any-wylbur-command'

WYLBUR executes this command first when you logon.  For example,
command can be an "EXEC FROM .." command.  Using the COMMAND option
will override all other AUTO options.  When you specify an initial
command ONLY that will get executed.  Presumably, if the command is
an EXEC FROM command the exec file itself can do an initial
processing that is appropriate.  (This documentation was updated on
3/5/86 to describe more explicitly how the SET AUTO COMMAND option
works.)

SHOW LINES Command:  The SHOW LINES command now displays the name of
the current ORVYL program or WYLBUR version next to the port number.

New PASS command:  The PASS command allows you to pass a command to
ORVYL without letting WYLBUR interpret it.  This is useful when
both WYLBUR and SPIRES recognize the same command verb (for example,
ALLOCATE).

New WAIT command:  The WAIT command tells WYLBUR to wait the
specified number of seconds.  This command is helpful in EXEC files.
Its syntax is:

       WAIT n [ATTN=line-number]

"n" is the number of seconds to wait (fractional number of seconds
such as 0.5 are also allowed).  The ATTN option lets you specify a
line number in an EXEC file at which to resume execution if the WAIT
operation is interrupted by an ATTN (pressing the BREAK key).


*02/23/86  NEW PRINT COMMAND OPTIONS

Two new PRINT and LPRINT options are available for locally-attached
LaserJet and LaserWriter printers.  These options, MANUAL and
FMANUAL, let you print on letterhead or special forms without first
reloading the paper tray.

When you print a job with one of these options, the printer waits
for you to feed paper through the manual feeder, the tray on the
back of the printer.  You feed the paper through and the job prints
on that paper instead of the paper from the paper tray.
Instructions for feeding the paper appear on the printer terminal
screen when you use one of these options.


   MANUAL  prints every page of the job through the manual
           feeder.  Pages are printed from first to last instead of
           in reverse order.

   FMANUAL prints the first page of a job on paper through the
           manual feeder.  The remaining pages print from the paper
           tray.  You would use this if you wanted to print only the
           first page of a letter on letterhead.  If you are
           printing multiple copies, the first page of each copy
           prints through the manual feeder.

The LaserJet printer flashes PF and L alternately in the status
code area when it is waiting for paper in the manual feeder.

The LaserWriter printer lights up the middle status light (above the
paper indicator) when it is waiting for paper from the manual
feeder.

If you are using either option with the LPRINT command, you must
first have told the system which kind of printer you are using (SET
LPRINT LASERJET, for example).

These options are ignored on any printer other than a LaserJet or
LaserWriter printer.


*02/23/86  NEW COMMANDS AND OPTIONS FOR USING TESTWYL

TESTWYL is a development version of WYLBUR available to all Data
Center users, containing changes that will eventually become part of
production WYLBUR.  Since TESTWYL is a development system, there is
always a chance of running into problems with new features that are
not yet fully functional.  Users who user TESTWYL do so at their own
risk.

If you do find any problems in TESTWYL please send mail to GG.JDN
and GG.SCH describing the problems.

To use TESTWYL from WYLBUR, type the command TESTWYL.  This logs you
off of WYLBUR and onto TESTWYL.

To use TESTWYL every time you logon, type the command:

    SET AUTO SYSTEM=TESTWYL

you only need to type the command JUST ONCE, and it will remain in
effect permanently.  You can later issue the command "SET AUTO
SYSTEM=WYLBUR" to make the production version of WYLBUR your default
again.

This command puts you into TESTWYL every time you logon.  If TESTWYL
is not available for some reason, you are put into WYLBUR instead.

The previous production version of WYLBUR is also usually available.
If something stops working and you suspect a WYLBUR change
may have caused it, you can type OLDWYL to logon to OLDWYL
and try it in the old version.
*02/23/86  WYLBUR EXEC FILE EXTENSIONS

WYLBUR's EXEC support has been greatly extended to include more
flexibility and power in using variables and expressions.  These
changes were implemented at Stanford, with the exception of the DSN
and YESNO functions which were implemented at Iowa State University
by Bill Frazier and Steve Kunz.

This article outlines some of the new features.  More extensions
will be added later this spring.

VARIABLES
There are three types of variables in the new WYLBUR
EXEC file extensions:  number, string, and boolean (True/False).

Names:  You are no longer limited to S0-9, W0-9, N0-9 for variable
names.  Variable names may have up to 16 characters including
numbers, letters, and the underscore character (_).  The first
character of the name must be an alphabetic character.  Some names
are reserved.  For example, S0 - S9 are assumed to be string
variables, to be compatible with current usage.  W0 - W9 are number
variables, and like all number variables have extended accuracy
(instead of being limited to valid WYLBUR line numbers.)

Arrays: You can also use arrays the new WYLBUR EXEC file support.
Arrays, however, must always be declared before they are used, using
the DECLARE command.  Specify the variable type, the array name, and
the array's maximum dimension (in square brackets).

     DECLARE NUMBER  name[num]
     DECLARE STRING  name[num]
     DECLARE BOOLEAN name[num]

To see the contents of an array, type the SHOW ARRAY command:

    SHOW ARRAY array-name

The LIKE, FROM, and TO options help you specify which parts of the
array to display.

Declaring Variables:  You must always DECLARE an array.  Variables
other than arrays may also be declared.  If undeclared, the type is
determined by the first usage.  Declaring a number variable sets its
initial value to 0.  Declared strings are set to '' (a null string)
and booleans to FALSE.

     DECLARE NUMBER  list-of-names
     DECLARE STRING  list-of-names
     DECLARE BOOLEAN list-of-names

System variables:  If you use the same variable name as an existing
system variable, you must include a prefix to get the system
variable:  SYS.name.  For example,

     DATE = 1066
     SV DATE           --->  1066
     SV SYS.DATE       ---> '14:53:13 02/20/86 (86.051)'

This article includes a list of some of the new system variables.

Assigning Values:  You can use the equal sign (=) to assign a value
to a variable:

     AUTHOR = 'William Shakespeare'

This replaces the old SET VALUE command.

Displaying Values:  To display the value of a variable, use the SHOW
VALUE command, which can now be abbreviated to SV:

     Command> sv author
     'William Shakespeare'

The SHOW VARS command displays your variables.  The LIKE option
displays any variables starting with the specified string.  The FROM
and TO options let you display an alphabetic range of variables.

Clearing Values: The CLEAR VARS command clears all of your
variables.

Preprocessor variables:  As before, you can use variables with
the WYLBUR preprocessor by putting an escape character before them.
With the new variables, however, you must put the variable itself in
parentheses if you use it with an escape character.  For example,

     SET ESCAPE &
     TAX = PRICE * .065
     WRITE 'The sales tax is &(TAX)'


EXPRESSIONS
Like variables, expressions evaluate to either a string, a boolean,
or a number value.

Operations:  valid operations are:

     +     addition                *     multiplication
     -     subtraction             /     division
     ~     NOT                     ||    concatenation
     AND   logical AND             EQ    equals
     OR    logical OR              NE    not equal
     LT    less than               GT    greater than
     LE    less than or equal      GE    greater than or equal

Operator precedence (the order in which operations are executed if
no parentheses are used) is as follows:

      1  -  ~ (not)
      2  -  * and /
      3  -  + and -
      4  -  ||
      5  -  EQ NE GT GE LT and LE
      6  -  AND and OR

You can use parentheses to change the order of precedence.  For
example, (2 + 3 * 5) evaluates to 17, but ((2 + 3) * 5) evaluates to
25.

Note that EQ is an operation whereas the equal sign (=) serves to
assign variable values.  Therefore, x = 10 does not return a
boolean TRUE or FALSE but instead assigns the value 10 to the
variable x.

PREPROCESSOR VARIABLES:  The following new preprocessor variables
have been added:

   ACTNAME       The name of the current active file
   ACTNO         The number of the current active file
   NEWNEWS       Boolean variable: TRUE means you have
                 unread news waiting, FALSE means you don't
   NEWMAIL       Boolean variable:  TRUE means you have unread
                 mail waiting, FALSE means you don't
   CPROMPT       Current command prompt string (type HELP
                 SET CPROMPT for information)
   WYLBUR        Name of WYLBUR system (returns 'TESTWYL'
                 if you are in TESTWYL)
   MACHINE       Name of this machine:
                    SYSA  -- 3084
                    SYSC  -- hospital system
                    SYSD  -- split 3084
                    RLG   -- RLG Amdahl (SYSB)
                    SYSE  -- RLG development Amdahl


NEW EXEC FILE COMMANDS: The following EXEC file commands have been
added:

   PUTEND text       Adds "text" to the end of the active file.
                     This should be used instead of simply "END
                     text".

   PUTLINE num text  Inserts or replaces the specified line in the
                     active file.  For example,
                        PUTLINE 12 This is line 12
                     This should be used instead of simply
                        12 This is line 12

OTHER CHANGES:  There are only two types of command logging:  LOG or
NOLOG.  SET EXEC TERSE and SET EXEC VERBOSE no longer work.

Multiple CLEAR options on the same command are no longer supported
(CLEAR ACTIVE EXECUTE SCREEN, for example).  CLEAR now works like
SET in that separate options must be on separate commands.


NEW PREPROCESSOR FUNCTIONS:  The following functions have been
added.  (Many are based on IBM's REXX EXEC file language).

          COPIES             FORMAT          DSNINFO
          LEFT               INT             DSNVERIFY
          RIGHT              MAX             DSNFORMAT
          CENTER             MIN             YESNO
          REVERSE            BITTEST
          STRIP              BITAND
          TRANSLATE          BITOR
          XRANGE             BITXOR

Descriptions of the functions follow:

COPIES(string,n)
returns "n" concatenated copies of "string".  "n" must be positive
or 0.

INT(number)
returns the integer value of the specified number, truncating any
characters after the decimal.

  SV INT(-199.84)  ---->  -199

FORMAT(number[,before][,after])
formats the given number.  "before" and "after" describe how many
characters to use for the integer part and decimal parts.  A value
of -1 for either of these values uses the number of characters
needed for each part.

  SV FORMAT ('128.1',2,3)   ----> '28.100'

MIN(number[,number]...)
returns the smallest number of the specified list.

MAX(number[,number]...)
returns the largest number of the specified list.

STRIP(string[,[option][,char]])
removes leading, trailing, or both leading and trailing characters,
depending on whether L, T, or B is specified as an option.  The
default is B (both).  "char" is the character to be stripped, which
defaults to a blank.

   SV STRIP('  ab c  ','L')         ----> 'ab c  '
   SV STRIP('00012.7000','B','0')   ----> '12.7'

RIGHT(string,length[,pad])
returns a string of length "length" with the specified string
aligned right in it.  The returned string is either truncated or
padded on the left as needed to reach the specified length.  Unless
specified, the pad character is a blank.

   SV RIGHT('12',5,'0')     ----> '00012'

LEFT(string,length[,pad])
works like the RIGHT function only aligns the string left instead.

   SV LEFT('12',5,'0')      ----> '12000'

CENTER(string,length[,pad])
returns a string of length "length" with the specified string
centered in it.  The string is either padded or truncated to meet
the desired length.  If not specified, the "pad" character defaults
to a blank.  If there is an odd number of characters to truncate or
add, the right end of the string loses or gains one more character
than the left end.

   SV CENTER('The blue sky',8) ----> 'e blue s'

REVERSE(string)
returns the string, swapped end for end.

   SV REVERSE('12345')  ----> '54321'

TRANSLATE (string[,tableo][,[tablei][,pad]])
translates characters in the given string to other characters
specified.  "tablei" is the input translate table, or the characters
to be translated, and "tableo" is the output translate table, or
what the characters are to be translated to.  The pad character, if
specified, replaces any characters in the input translate table that
are not replaced by the output translate table.  Without translate
tables, the TRANSLATE function translates the string to uppercase.

   SV TRANSLATE('abcdef','12','ec')       ----> 'ab2d1f'
   SV TRANSLATE('abcdef','12','abcd','.') ----> '12..ef'

XRANGE([start][,end])
returns all one byte EBCDIC codes between and including the values
"start" and "end".  If "start" is greater than "end", the returned
values wrap from X'FF' to X'00'.  "start" and "end" must be single
characters.  This is usually used in conjunction with the TRANSLATE
function.

   SV XRANGE('0','4') ----> '01234'

DSNINFO('dsname options')
returns information on the location, size, format, etc.
for any online OS dataset on the system.  The information
returned is a string containing all the information a "SHOW DSN
ONLY ...  ALL" would return, but in fixed-field format.

The information returned is positioned as follows:

         COLUMN RANGE              INFORMATION
         1-6                       Volume containing the dataset
         8-51                      Fully qualified dataset name
         53-57                     Number of tracks used
         59-63                     Number of tracks allocated
         65-67                     Number of Extents
         69-70                     DSORG ("PO", "PS", etc.)
         72-76                     RECFM ("U   ", "FBA ", etc.)
         77-81                     LRECL
         83-87                     BLKSIZE
         89-93                     KEYLEN ("00000" if not keyed)
         95-102                    Creation date (mm/dd/yy)
         104-111                   Last access (mm/dd/yy)

It returns a null string if the information is not available (the
data set does not exist, is offline, is in use, etc.)

DSNVERIFY('dsname options')
verifies the existence and status of a dataset in the OS file
system.  The parameter is a string holding the standard WYLBUR
options describing a dataset ('LIB', 'WYL.GG.UUU.MINE', etc.).
It returns one of the following strings:

 "NOT THERE"-- Dataset not cataloged or not on the volume
 "OK"       -- Dataset is present and could be USEd (unless it is an
               entire library, in which case you must USE a member)
 "IN USE"   -- Dataset is "in use" (exclusive enqueue by another
               process
 "NO ACCESS"-- No "READ" access to the dataset (OS password
               protection)
 "OFFLINE"  -- Volume holding the dataset is offline
 "UNUSABLE" -- Dataset is unusable (bad RECFM for WYLBUR, I/O errors,
               or other "system" reasons)

DSNFORMAT('dsname options')
Returns a string containing the fully qualified dataset name for the
specified OS data set.  The dataset may be specified in any valid
WYLBUR forms (including ACCOUNT, USER, GROUP, &user.name, or library
member names).  Note that this does not verify that the dataset
actually exists.

YESNO('prompt string')
Appends the string " (Yes/No)?" to the specified string as a prompt.
The function returns a string based on the response to the prompt:

      "ATTN"  -- Attention key was pressed
      "YES"   -- "Yes" (or "Y") or OK
      "NULL"  -- carriage return alone
      "NO"    -- "No"

YESNO reprompts for any response other than yes, no, return, ok or
attention.   For example,

   ANSWER = YESNO('OK to clear your active file')
   IF (ANSWER EQ 'YES') CLE ACT

BITTEST, BITAND, BITOR, BITXOR are bitwise logical functions.  All
arguments are expressed as decimal integers but are processed as bit
strings.  The argument "15" represents the hex string "0F"
which is binary "00001111".  Operations are performed on these bits
and the result is again expressed an an integer.  The integers are
stored in fullwords, so 31 bits are available.

BITTEST(var,mask)  yields a boolean (true/false) result.  The bits
                   in "var" are tested using the bits in "mask".  The
                   result is true (1) if all bits in "var" that
                   correspond to "mask" are 1, and false (0)
                   otherwise.

BITAND(var1,var2)  is the bitwise AND of the two variables; that is,
                   each bit in the result is 1 if (and only if) the
                   corresponding bit in both arguments is 1.

BITOR(var1,var2)   is the bitwise OR:  result bit is 1 if either of
                   the argument bits is 1, or if both are 1; zero if
                   both argument bits are zero.

BITXOR(var1,var2)  is the bitwise exclusive OR:  result bit is 1 if
                   one argument bit is 1 and the other is zero, and
                   is zero if both arguments are zero or both are 1.

*09/10/85  NEW SAVE AND USE OPTIONS FOR SAMSON VERSION 2.3

Many word processing packages (including WordStar and MultiMate)
distinguish between hard carriage returns and soft carriage returns.
Since WYLBUR files only have one kind of carriage return, when you
save a file using Samson, every line ends with a hard carriage
return.  Often you then have to edit the file to replace the hard
carriage returns with soft carriage returns.

There is a new STREAM option on the SAVE command which will make
this task much easier.  For example:

         Command> save a:textfile stream

When you SAVE a file with the STREAM option, consecutive lines of
text which are NOT indented are saved as one long "stream" of text,
with hard carriage returns only added at the end of the stream.
This is usually the correct interpretation for text.

Likewise, when you upload a file to WYLBUR from a word processing
program, soft carriage returns are ignored, so the resulting lines
may be very long (up to WYLBUR's maximum of 235).  There is a new
"WRAP=n" option on the USE command which will break lines at the
specified column, with text breaking at the closest blank.  For
example, to upload a file creating line lengths of up to 68
characters, use the command:

         Command> use a:textfile wrap=68

The new STREAM and WRAP options will ONLY work correctly with Samson
version 2.3 or higher.


*08/22/85  IMPROVEMENTS TO LINE MODE WYLBUR AND OTHER COMMANDS

A new version of WYLBUR has been installed, containing many new
options on existing commands and some new commands.  These
modifications were originally made by Steve Kunz and Bill Frazier of
the Iowa State Computation Center.

NEW COMMANDS AND OPTIONS:

OSRENAME  renames a WYLBUR data set

TRY       for EXEC files, executes command without causing an
          EXEC break if the command fails.

MODIFY command:          new modify characters W, P and G
                         EQUAL, OVER, and UNDER options

EDIT command:            EQUAL, OVER, and UNDER options

SHOW MAIL command:       COLLECT response to Delete? prompt

COPY and MOVE commands:  DITTO option

DEFINE command:          NOTRIM option

COUNT command:           STRING option

JOIN command:            NOTRIM option

FETCH command:           UNNUMBERED option with DISPLAY option

SET JES command:         NOPREFIX option

SET JOB command:         HOLD, NOHOLD, and NOTIFY options

SET OUTPUT command:      HOLD and NOHOLD options

SHOW GETSTACK:           displays contents of get stack

CLEAR GETSTACK:          clears contents of get stack

The new command OSRENAME renames a WYLBUR file.  It changes only the
name of the file (not the file format).  You can rename either a
sequential data set or a library member.  You can use this command
to move a file from one account to another.

One major change to MODIFY is the W modify character on the MODIFY
command, which works in conjunction with another modify character to
affect an entire word instead of a single character.  For example,
typing WD under a word deletes that entire word.  Typing 2WD deletes
two words.

The W option also works with the two new modify characters G (for
get) and P (for put).  G deletes characters from a line and puts
them in a temporary storage space called the "get stack", and P
inserts characters from the get stack into a modified line.  The two
new commands SHOW GETSTACK and CLEAR GETSTACK display and clear the
contents of the get stack, respectively.

The EQUAL, UNDER and OVER options on the MODIFY and EDIT commands
let you modify or edit lines of a certain length.  For example,
you can MODIFY OVER 80 to modify those lines longer than 80
characters.

COLLECT is now a valid option to the WYLBUR Mail Delete?  prompt.
COLLECT puts a copy of the mail message at the end of your active
file.

For information on the other new options and commands, type HELP
followed by the command and option desired.


*08/22/85  NEW OPTIONS ON THE ALTER COMMAND

The ALTER command has been modified to add five new options for
changing jobs awaiting execution or printing.  The new options are:

   KEEP=YES or KEEP   Requests that the job be kept on the spool
                      after printing, so it can be reprinted if
                      necessary.

   KEEP=NO or NOKEEP  Removes the KEEP option from a job.

   LANDSCAPE          Changes the job to "landscape" orientation on
                      9700, 2700, or LaserJet laser printers.

   PORTRAIT           Changes the job to "portrait" orientation on
                      9700, 2700, or LaserJet laser printers.

   PFORMAT=format     Changes the PFORMAT used for jobs on the 9700
                      laser printer.

*06/20/85  NEW LPRINT FEATURES

The LPRINT command, announced in April of this year, has been
extended.  The LPRINT command prints a file on a printer attached to
an IBM PC running Samson Version 2.1 or higher, or a VT100
compatible terminal with a printer attached.

The new LPRINT command functions like the PRINT command in several
ways:

    -  It now prints 60 lines and then sends a page eject to the
       printer, so your output does not print over page boundaries.

    -  If the first line of the file is an OPTIONS line, the LPRINT
       command obeys the options on that line.

    -  LPRINT is now a valid option in response to the WYLBUR Mail
       Delete? prompt.

For a list of options available on the LPRINT command, type HELP
LPRINT.

Two new commands associated with LPRINT have also been added: JPRINT
and SET LPRINT.

The JPRINT command prints all or part of a job in the output queue
on your locally-attached printer.  This way you do not have to first
FETCH then LPRINT job output.  The syntax is:

   JPRINT jobid [account-options] [LOG|NOLOG] [JCL|NOJCL]
          [MSG|NOMSG] [SYSOUT=c] [FORMS=ffff] [STEP=stepname]
          [DDNAME=id]

The SET LPRINT command tells the printer which type of printer you
are using.  At present, the only option is LASERJET, for the
Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer, which is the only printer for
which special support has been developed.  Special support available
for the LaserJet includes the use of the various character sets
available for the LaserJet and landscape printing,


*05/16/85  NEW COMMAND RETRY CAPABILITIES

WYLBUR's command retry capabilities have been extended.  Command
retry is the ability to recall an already typed command and either
edit it or reissue it as is.

In the past, typing @ followed by the BREAK or ATTN key resulted in
the last typed command appearing on the screen with a MODS> prompt.
Although this still works, typing simply @ followed by pressing the
RETURN key now works the same way.

Command retry is now available in page mode.  Typing @ and pressing
the RETURN key on the command line (while in page mode) displays the
previously typed command on the command line, where you can edit it
as you would any text in Page mode.

WYLBUR now also keeps a list, or rather a history, of the commands
you have typed during the current session.  By default, WYLBUR keeps
track of the last twenty commands typed.  You can choose to keep any
number of commands in the history, with the SET HISTORY command.
Its syntax is:

     SET HISTORY n

n is the number of commands to keep.  Currently, the maximum number
of commands you can keep is 250.

You can look at your command history with the SHOW HISTORY command.
This command displays the commands in your history.  It also
displays a number with each command, with the number 1 being the
first typed command of the current session.  The syntax of the SHOW
HISTORY command is:

     SHOW HISTORY [n]

If you include a number on the SHOW HISTORY command, WYLBUR displays
the last n commands in the history.

To clear the commands in your command history, issue the CLEAR
HISTORY command.

You can use command retry to recover any of the commands in your
history.  Typing a command consisting of the @ symbol followed by a
stem (part or all of a command) retrieves the latest command
beginning with that stem.  Typing the @ symbol followed by a number
retrieves that command number in your history (as displayed by the
SHOW HISTORY command).

EXAMPLES:

  Command> @  <-- recalls the previous command
  Command> @sho  <-- recalls the last command starting with 'sho'
  Command> @use #  <-- recalls the last command using a library member
  Command> @10   <-- recalls tenth command in your session (if it is
                     still in your command history)


*04/29/85  NEW LPRINT COMMAND PRINTS ON LOCALLY ATTACHED PRINTERS

A new command, LPRINT, has been added to WYLBUR.  The LPRINT command
sends a copy of your active file to a printer attached to your IBM
PC running Samson Version 2.1.  It also works with VT100-compatible
terminals with printers attached.

The LPRINT command functions like the LIST command, except that it
sends the listing to a locally attached printer instead of to your
terminal screen.  If there is no printer attached to your PC, WYLBUR
sends the listing to your terminal screen instead.

The exact syntax of the command is:

LPRINT [range] [EXECUTE|FROM dsname [account-options] [ON volume]
     [format-options]] [list-options] [HEX|MIXED] [CC|MC]
     [COLUMNS=m[/n]] [MARKER=c] [INDENT=n] [DOUBLE|TRIPLE]
     [SQUASHED] [NONL] [CLEAN] [ATTN=line-number]

The options on the LPRINT command are identical to the options on
the LIST command.  Type HELP LPRINT for a complete description of
these options.

Note that you must wait while the file prints before you can issue
another command.


*03/22/85  WYLBUR CAN NOW SEARCH FOR PATTERNS OF CHARACTERS

WYLBUR can now match patterns in its searches.  This addition to
WYLBUR ranges was implemented by Steve Kunz of the Iowa State
Computation Center.  Pattern-matching means that WYLBUR can search
for certain types and patterns of characters in addition to specific
strings of characters.

Use the new pattern matching ability by putting a letter P before a
range.  The "P" indicates to WYLBUR to treat the following range as
one including a pattern.  To define the pattern you want to find,
you can use what are called "generic descriptors" or variables
indicating what type of character you are looking for.  The generic
descriptors and their meanings are:

       <A>   Any character from A-Z, upper- or lowercase
       <N>   Any number
       <B>   A blank space
       <S>   Any special character (includes punctuation and &,^,%,etc)
       <C>   Any control (non-printable) character
       <X>   Any character

The generic indicators must always be surrounded by angle brackets
(<>).  Anything not surrounded by angle brackets is interpreted as
a literal string.  You can combine literal strings and patterns.
You can modify the generic descriptors with numbers.  <2N> means any
two numbers. You can also use an asterisk (*) to indicate an unknown
number of something.  <*A> means any number of alphabetic
characters.

You can use the pattern matching on the LIST, VIEW, MODIFY, EDIT,
and POINT commands.

EXAMPLES:

  MODIFY P'<N>' 10/20         Modify any line that contains a number
                              in columns 10 through 20.

  POINT P'<3N>-<4N>'          Point to any lines containing three
                              numbers followed by a dash followed by
                              four numbers (phone numbers).

  VIEW P'EXEC<*X>CLEAR'       View lines containing the string "EXEC"
                              followed by any number of characters
                              followed by the string "CLEAR".

  LIST P'<C>' MIXED           List those lines containing unprintable
                              characters (control-characters).

You can combine or divide the generic descriptors as you want.
"<*ABS>" and "<*A><B><S>" are equivalent.


*02/08/85  IBM 3270-TYPE TERMINALS NOW SUPPORTED IN PAGE WYLBUR

IBM 3270-type terminals are now supported in Page WYLBUR.  This
includes the IBM 3178, 3179, 3180, 3276, 3278, 3279, 3290, and 8775
display terminals.

Page WYLBUR works differently on these terminals than on other
currently supported terminals.  Instructions for using Page mode on
these terminals are in the document "Using the IBM 3270 Terminal at
Stanford" (document #709), which is available at Document Sales,
Forsythe Hall.

For instructions describing which keys have special functions in Page
mode, type HELP TERMINAL 3270 to the command prompt.


*12/12/84  LIBLIST PROGRAM NOW DISPLAYS WYLBUR TITLES

We recently installed a new version of LIBLIST, a utility that lists
the contents of each member of a library.  The new version now
displays any WYLBUR titles in its directory listing.  Our thanks to
Bill Frazier of the Iowa State Computation Center for making this
extension and sending it back to us.

Type "UTIL LIBLIST" to use the LIBLIST program.


*11/27/84  SET MAIL COMMAND EXTENDED

The SET MAIL command options have been extended to allow mail
forwarding to accounts on other systems and to increase the length
of the message that may be set on an account.

Without any options, the SET MAIL command enables an account to
receive WYLBUR mail.  The syntax of the SET MAIL command is:

      SET MAIL [FORWARD gg.uuu[@node]|NOFORWARD] ['message']

You can forward mail either to another ITS account or a network
mail address.  For example, the command

      SET MAIL FORWARD U.USER@LOTS-C

will direct any future mail to that account at LOTS-C, until you
give the command SET MAIL NOFORWARD.

The message option sets a message on your account that is sent to
anyone who sends you mail.  This message may now be up to 80
characters long, instead of the previous limit of 20 characters,
and must be contained in single quotation marks (apostrophes).


*10/23/84  NEW OPTIONS ON PRINT COMMAND

Two new options, LANDSCAPE and KEEP, have been added to the PRINT
and RUN commands.

The LANDSCAPE option requests that output is printed in landscape
mode, with the lines parallel to the long side of the paper.
Output printed on 1181 is printed in LANDSCAPE mode.  The LANDSCAPE
option will only apply to the Xerox 9700 and Xerox 2700 printers.

The KEEP option on the RUN and PRINT commands specifies that a job
will be kept in the output queue in output hold after it has
printed.  This provides a means of backing up print jobs that are
difficult or costly to reproduce.

Kept output will only remain in the output queue for 48 hours, after
which it will be purged automatically.  The holding period will no
decrement over the weekend time block if the holding period is down
to 12 hours or less.


*09/28/84  3081 CONNECTED TO INTERNET FOR CAMPUS ELECTRONIC MAIL

The IBM 3081 is now connected to the campus Internet, which is a set
of several interconnected Ethernet local area networks.  As a
result, you can use WYLBUR MAIL and EMS to communicate with people
who use other campus computers on the Internet.  Currently over 300
machines are connected, including other large computer centers such
as GSB, LOTS, SCORE, SIERRA, SUMEX, and SAIL.  The command HELP
HOSTS lists the names of the computers connected to the Internet.

To send mail to user FRIEND at SCORE, for example, write your
message in your active file and then issue the command MAIL TO
FRIEND@SCORE.  If you are using EMS, type FRIEND@SCORE in response
to the request for recipients.

Users on other machines can send you mail by sending network mail
to "gg.uuu@FORSYTHE", where "gg.uuu" is your WYLBUR account.

Please report any problems by using the SUGGEST WYLBUR command.


*08/03/84  "KEYWORD" TO BE CHANGED TO "PASSWORD" ON SEPT. 1

On September 1, 1984, the term "keyword" will be changed to
"password".  The change is being made to make our system more
consistent with other computer systems.  This means that when you
are logging on, the WYLBUR "Keyword?" prompt will become "Password?"
instead.  The SET PASSWORD command will be added to allow you to
change your current password.  (The existing SET KEYWORD command
will remain as an alternate form.)

We hope that the impact of this change will be minor.  If you have
any questions or concerns, please send your comments to the ITS
staff with the SUGGEST command (using the subject WYLBUR).


*08/02/84  NEW UTIL COMMAND ADDED TO START PUBLIC EXEC FILES

A new command, UTIL, has been added to WYLBUR.  UTIL provides an
easier way of starting public EXEC files than the previous command.
The basic form of the new command is:

     UTIL execfile [parm]

where 'execfile' stands for the name of the EXEC file.  UTIL is now
an alternate form of the EXECUTE command, which has the syntax:

     EXECUTE FROM LIB#execfile PUBLIC [PARM='parm'] CLEAR

For example, typing "UTIL TAPECOPY" will start the tapecopy public
exec file.

For more information about the EXECUTE command, see the "WYLBUR
Reference Manual".


*06/28/84  VERSION TWO OF PAGE WYLBUR TO BE INSTALLED JULY 1ST

The second major version of Page WYLBUR will be installed on July
1st.  Changes in this version include extended support for new
terminal types, the ability to conveniently edit lines longer than
the terminal screen width, and an integrated spelling checker.

The screen formatting in version two Page WYLBUR has been changed
slightly.  There is a new column line at the bottom of the screen,
and the "Help Redisplay Quit" line has been removed.


TERMINAL SUPPORT EXTENDED:  Version two now supports many new types
of terminals.  The terminals now supported in Page WYLBUR are:

      Terminal Type        Manufacturer/Model
      -------------        ------------------

        VT100              Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC) VT100
                             or DEC VT100 compatible terminals
        Z19                Zenith Z-19

        CIT427             C. Itoh 427 color graphics terminal
        CIT500             C. Itoh 500 large screen terminal
        IBMPC/IBMPCC       IBM Personal Computer (running Samson)
        ISC2405            Intercolor 2400 color graphics terminal
        HP2621             Hewlett-Packard 2621
        HP2622             Hewlett-Packard 2622
        HP150              Hewlett-Packard 150 Personal Computer
        HP110              Hewlett-Packard 110 Personal Computer

You identify the type of terminal you are using by issuing the
command:

        SET TERMINAL type

where "type" is one of the supported terminal types listed in the
table above.

The function keys on these terminals can be used instead of the
longer two and three key Page WYLBUR commands.  To get information
on the function key definitions, type:

        HELP TERMINAL type

In place of "type" you should enter the type of terminal you want
more information on.  For example, "HELP TERMINAL VT100".

The command:

        HELP TERMINALS

will give you a current list of the supported terminals.


INCREASED LINE LENGTH CAPACITY:  Page WYLBUR can now edit lines
longer than the screen width in two ways.

Text longer than the screen display width is now accessible.  When
you type a line longer than the screen display, Page WYLBUR reminds
you of the unseen text by putting an exclamation mark (!) next to
that line number.

When you delete information in that line, the unseen text will
return to the screen.  If you delete the entire line, the unseen
text is also deleted.

On VT100-type terminals you may now switch between 80 and 132 column
mode.  To switch to and from wide mode (132 columns) type ESC WW.


NEW COMMANDS:  Several new page mode commands have been added.
They are:

         Command           Description
         -------           -----------

         CTRL-G<c>         Move cursor to the next "c" character.

         ESC CTRL-G<c>     Move cursor to the previous 'c' character.

         DEL CTRL-G<c>     Delete until the 'c' character.

         ESC V             Redisplay the entire screen.

         ESC G             Guess spelling (see New Spelling
                           Facility item below).

         ESC L             Learn word (see spelling item below).


A series of window commands have been added, which change the
display of text on your screen.  They are as follows:

         ESC WW            Change Window Width.
                             (Switches terminal to and from wide
                             mode on VT100 type terminals.)

         ESC WS            Split Window (make a new window).

         ESC WJ            Join Window (delete an old window).

         ESC WL            Scroll text left.

         ESC WR            Scroll text right.

         ESC WN            Make lines numbered/unnumbered (toggle).

         ESC WC            Make this line a column line (toggle).

         ESC WT            Add a tab stop at this column (toggle).

         ESC W>            Set the right margin at this column.

         ESC W+            Turn on word wrap at right margin.

         ESC W-            Turn off word wrap at right margin.

For reference, type HELP PAGE WINDOWS.


OTHER CHANGES:  The Help, Redisplay, and Quit boxes at the bottom of
the screen have been replaced by a column line.  To issue these
commands, use the following key commands:

         Help           ESC H
         Redisplay      ESC V
         Quit           BREAK

The new column line will show column spaces, numbered by tens with
markers at the 5-column spaces.

The message [Wait] now appears at the bottom right of your screen
when WYLBUR is processing your commands.

A spelling checker has been integrated with Page WYLBUR.  See the
following item on the new spelling facility for information.


*06/28/84  NEW SPELLING CHECK FACILITY ADDED

A new spelling check facility is now available in WYLBUR.  The
speller lets you conveniently find and correct words which are
incorrectly spelled.  The SPELL command will check the spelling of
the text in your active file and display any words (of more than two
characters) not found in its dictionary.

The speller's system dictionary consists of over 100,000 words.  You
can extend this dictionary by building up your own private
dictionary with the LEARN command.  The LEARN commands only last as
long as you are logged on, so you may want to write an EXEC file
with LEARN commands for frequently used words.

The new spelling commands are:

         Command           Description
         -------           -----------

         SPELL [range]     Check spelling of lines in active file.

         GUESS word        Guess correct spelling of a word.

         LEARN word        Add the word to your private dictionary.

         UNLEARN word      Remove the word from your private
                             dictionary.

         SHOW LEARNED      Display all words in your private
                             dictionary.

         CLEAR LEARNED     Remove all words from your private
                             dictionary.

For more information on a spelling command, type HELP followed by
the command name.  For example, "HELP SPELL".


SPELLING IN PAGE MODE:  The spelling check facility is also
available in page mode, with the VIEW command.  The new page mode
spelling commands are:

         ESC G               Guess the correct spelling of the word
                               the cursor is on.

         ESC L               Add the word the cursor is on to your
                               private dictionary.

If you type SET VIEW SPELL, then the speller will check the text as
you type it, highlighting any words not in its dictionary.  The
highlighting is only for your reference; you do not need to change
the highlighted words.  To turn off this option, type the command
SET VIEW NOSPELL.

The SET VIEW options only last for the current session, so you may
want to add a SET VIEW command to your LOGON EXEC file.

Type HELP SPELL for more information on the speller.


*12/19/83  PAGE WYLBUR NOW AVAILABLE TO ALL USERS

Page WYLBUR is now available to the entire ITS user community.  It is
an extension to WYLBUR that provides page editing, the type of
editing provided by text editors on microcomputers.  You can edit a
screen full (or page) of text by moving around the screen, inserting,
deleting, and changing text, seeing the changes as you make them.
Type HELP PAGE WYLBUR for a brief online description of how to use
the system.  ITS will offer a Page WYLBUR seminar in January.  Watch
NEWS for an announcement of the exact date.

*11/28/83  LOGON MESSAGE WILL BE CHANGED ON SUNDAY, DECEMBER 4

On Sunday, December 4, the wording of the logon message will be
changed.  The new message format will be:

      Connecting to SYSA on port <port-information>

      Welcome to the Stanford Timesharing System.

      Account?

"You must answer the "Account?" prompt by giving your account in the
"gg uuu" format.  The old "uuu gg" form will not be accepted.

Pay special attention to this change if you use a microcomputer as a
terminal for the IBM 3081 and have programmed responses with an
exact message that allows you to logon automatically.  Please use
the SUGGEST WYLBUR command to report any problems this change may
cause.


*08/11/83  (Effective 08/14) NEW TYPEAHEAD MODE INSTALLED

A new TYPEAHEAD mode has been installed for the terminals controlled
by the PDP-11 terminal controller.  (If you type "20" in response to
the "enter class" prompt when you logon, you are using the PDP-11.)

In TYPEAHEAD mode you no longer need to wait for the line-number
prompts when typing text in collect mode.  Pressing the BREAK key
clears any characters you may have typed ahead, in addition to
interrupting the computer.

TYPEAHEAD mode is the default.  The command SET TERMINAL NOTYPEAHEAD
turns off TYPEAHEAD mode; SET TERMINAL TYPEAHEAD turns it on again.
When TYPEAHEAD is turned off, any characters typed before the prompt
appears are ignored.


*08/11/83  (Effective 08/14) NEW CONTROL KEY FUNCTIONS ADDED

The PDP-11 terminal controller software supports two new control key
functions.  You enter a CONTROL key function by holding down the key
marked CONTROL or CTRL, typing an alphabetic key, and then releasing
the CONTROL key.  For example, to enter the CONTROL key code,
CTRL-X, you would hold down the CONTROL key, type the letter X key,
and then release the CONTROL key.  The new functions are:

CONTROL-X   erases all the text you have entered on the current line.
            If you are in TYPEAHEAD mode (see the 08/11/83
            DOC#WYLBUR article on TYPEAHEAD), typing CONTROL-X clears
            all the characters typed ahead of the prompt.

CONTROL-C   is identical to pressing the BREAK key.


*06/14/83  (Effective 06/19) NEW SHOW CATALOG COMMAND

The SHOW CATALOG command has been revised so that it works with
IBM's new Integrated Catalog Facility (ICF) system catalog.  On June
19, the ICF catalog will be installed on the IBM 3081 serving the
University community.

The new system catalog is expected to improve reliability.  It will
also remove one restriction from data set naming rules.  For
example, it will be possible to have a data set named FRED and
another named FRED.TEMP; with the old catalog, FRED is an "index" of
FRED.TEMP and cannot be used as a data set name.

The response from the new SHOW CATALOG command differs from the
response from the old SHOW CATALOG command, as follows:

  -  The header line, usually "WYL.gg.uuu", is no longer displayed.

  -  The volume the data set resides on is not displayed unless you
     specify the VOLUME option.

  -  The complete data set name is always displayed.  WYLBUR will no
     longer display parts of the data set name as "index" levels.

The changes in the response format reflect changes IBM has made in
their new ICF catalog.  The volume is not displayed unless you
request it because it takes longer for WYLBUR to get both the volume
and the data set name from the ICF catalog.  Index levels are no
longer displayed because the ICF catalog does not have index levels
internally.

If you have EXEC files that issue the DUMP CATALOG command and
then process the responses, you will probably have to revise them.
We suggest that you use the new DUMP CATALOG INTERNAL command
that returns the catalog information in a fixed column format
(see the description below).

The syntax for the new SHOW CATALOG command is:

SHOW CATALOG [gg.uuu] [DISK|TAPE] [VOLUME] [ON volume]
     [LIKE string] | [FROM starting-string] [TO ending-string]
     [INTERNAL] [collect-options]

The SHOW CATALOG command displays an alphabetized list of your data
set names that are in the system catalog.  Whenever you save a data
set, WYLBUR enters the name of that data set in the system catalog.
(It is possible to have data sets with names that are not in the
catalog; however, this is not normally the case.)

The options on the SHOW CATALOG command are:

gg.uuu           specifies the account for which the data set names
                 are to be displayed.  If this option is omitted, the
                 account of the logged-on user is assumed.  Type
                 HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a description of the other
                 account-options that are available.

DISK             displays only the data set names of data sets that
                 are cataloged on disk (excludes data sets
                 cataloged on tape).

TAPE             displays only the data set names of data sets that
                 are cataloged on tape (excludes data sets
                 cataloged on disk).

VOLUME           displays the volume for each data set.  For data
                 sets cataloged on tape devices, this option also
                 causes the file sequence number and number of
                 volumes to be displayed.

ON volume        displays only the data set names of data sets
                 cataloged on the specified volume.  The volume name
                 can contain an asterisk (*) in any position to match
                 any character in the data set's volume name.  For
                 example, "ON PUB***" will display the names of
                 data sets on any volume beginning with "PUB".

LIKE string      displays only the data set names that begin with the
                 specified string.

FROM string      displays the data set names starting from the
                 specified string and proceeding alphabetically.  For
                 example, "FROM J" displays data set names starting
                 with J and then K, L, M, etc.

TO string        displays the data set names up to (and including)
                 the specified string.  For example, "TO P" displays
                 the data set names alphabetically until a data set
                 with the name P is reached.

INTERNAL         causes the data set names to be displayed in a fixed
                 format.  This is helpful when the response is being
                 directed to the ACTIVE file (i.e., DUMP CATALOG
                 INTERNAL) for further processing.  The format of
                 the responses are:

  Columns  1/1   Catalog entry type ("A" is a standard data set).
           2/2   Reserved, blank.
           3/46  Fully qualified data set name.
          47/52  Volume serial.
          53/53  Reserved, blank.
          54/54  Device type (D=disk, T=tape)
          55/58  File Sequence number (only for tapes).
          59/61  Number of volumes (only for tapes).
          62/235 Reserved for future use.

collect-options  allow you to place the data set names in your active
                 file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for a complete
                 description of these options.

*05/31/83  (Effective 06/04) ERROR MESSAGES AND PROMPTS CLARIFIED

Several error messages have been reworded to improve clarity.
Remember, if you get an error message that you don't understand you
can type a question mark (?) in response to the next command prompt
for more information.

Messages and prompts have also been converted to upper and lower
case to improve legibility.  In addition, WYLBUR prompts that
require an answer of YES or NO will now have "(Yes/No)" added to the
end of the prompt.  For example, the old prompt:

     CLEAR?

is now:

     Clear (Yes/No)?


*05/31/83  (Effective 06/04) "FROM dsname" OPTION ADDED TO LIST COMMAND

A "FROM dsname" option has been added to the LIST command that
allows you to list a data set without changing the contents of your
ACTIVE file.  You can include the other LIST command options with
the LIST FROM command.

Some examples of the LIST FROM command are:

     LIST FROM DOC#WYLBUR PUBLIC

     LIST 1/50 FROM MYFILE UNNUMBERED CC

     LIST C'SET' FROM LIB#LOGON


*05/31/83  (Effective 06/04) USE THE "GG.UUU" ACCOUNT FORMAT TO LOGON

Please respond to the ACCOUNT? prompt at logon with your account in
the "gg.uuu" format.  If you are using a subgroup (or project-id)
then you should enter your account in the "gg.uuu.subgroup" format.

WYLBUR now warns you when you logon by typing your account in
the old format (uuu gg).  After August 15th, WYLBUR will not let
you logon, unless you use the correct account format (gg.uuu).

Since we have been encouraging users to enter their accounts in the
"gg.uuu" format for almost six years, we hope this change will not
affect you.  The "uuu gg" is being phased out to remove confusion
caused when the response to the ACCOUNT?  prompt is ambiguous and in
preparation for the next version of WYLBUR that will allow you to
respond to ACCOUNT? with additional options, besides your account.


*05/31/83  (Effective 06/04) NEW LOGOFF MESSAGES PROVIDE COST BREAKDOWN

When you logoff, WYLBUR now displays the dollar amount for each
component of your bill, in addition to the total session charge.

You can use the new SHOW COST command (see the description below)
to show your current session cost, at any point during the session.


*05/31/83  (Effective 06/04) SHOW COST COMMAND ADDED

A SHOW COST command has been added that displays your current
session costs and a breakdown of the resources used.  The cost shown
is an estimate (it is not your actual billing charge) and may have
roundoff errors amounting to a few cents.

The response from the SHOW COST command is:

     hh:mm:ss elapsed time ($n.nn)       nnnn disk I/O's
     n.n CPU seconds ($n.nn)             nnnn terminal I/O's ($n.n)

     Current session charges: $n.nn

where:

elapsed time      is the amount of (wall clock) time you have been
                  logged on during the current session.

disk I/O's        is the number of ORVYL and WYLBUR disk requests
                  that you have made.  (Commands such as USE and
                  SAVE make disk requests.)  There is currently no
                  charge for disk requests.

CPU seconds       is the number of seconds the 3081 computer has
                  used to process your requests.

terminal I/O's    is the number of messages that have been written
                  to the terminal plus the number of input lines
                  you have typed.


The INTERNAL option on the SHOW COST command can be used to return
all the billing information in a fixed column format.  This is
helpful when the response is being directed to the ACTIVE file for
further processing (with the command DUMP COST INTERNAL).  The
format is:

....v....1....v....2....v....3....v....4....v....5....v....6....v
$nnnn.nnn nnnnnn $nnnn.nnn nnnn.nnn $nnnn.nnn nnnn.nnn $nnnn.nnn

(continued)    ....7....v....8....v....9....v....A....v....B....v
               nnnnnn $nnnn.nnn nnnnnn $nnnn.nnn nnnnnn $nnnn.nnn

The information provided in the fixed column format is explained as
follows:

   Columns      Description

     1/9      current session charges (in dollars)
    11/16     elapsed seconds
    18/26     charges for elapsed time (in dollars)
    28/35     WYLBUR CPU seconds
    37/45     charges for WYLBUR CPU seconds (in dollars)
    47/54     ORVYL CPU seconds
    56/64     charges for ORVYL CPU seconds (in dollars)
    66/71     number of WYLBUR disk I/O's
    73/81     charges for WYLBUR disk I/O's (in dollars)
               (Since there is currently no charge for WYLBUR
               disk I/O's, this amount should always be zero.)
    83/88     number of ORVYL disk I/O's
    90/98     charges for ORVYL disk I/O's (in dollars)
               (Since there is currently no charge for ORVYL
               disk I/O's, this amount should always be zero.)
  100/105     number of terminal I/O's
  107/115     charges for terminal I/O's (in dollars)
  116/235     reserved for future use


*05/31/83  (Effective 06/04) CHANGES TO THE MODIFY AND EDIT COMMANDS

Two dot subcommands (or line-oriented functions) have been added to
the MODIFY and EDIT commands, namely:

    .MODIFY (or .M)     Typing this subcommand in response to
                        the "Edits>" prompt causes WYLBUR to switch
                        to MODIFY mode and re-prompt "Mods>".

    .EDIT (or .E)       Typing this sub-command in response to the
                        "Mods>" prompt causes WYLBUR to switch
                        to EDIT mode and re-prompt "Edits>".

Typing "^" and then BREAK to switch from MODIFY to EDIT mode is no
longer supported; use the new .MODIFY or .EDIT subcommands
instead.  Typing "$" and then BREAK to stop modifying the current
range has also been removed; use the .STOP subcommand instead.


*05/31/83  (Effective 06/04) CHANGES TO DUMP DIRECTORY RESPONSES

The responses from the DUMP DIRECTORY command are now identical to
the responses from the SHOW DIRECTORY command.  Previously, WYLBUR
would not show titles in the DUMP DIRECTORY responses (for
compatibility with the previous version of WYLBUR).  You may have to
change your EXEC files, if they are sensitive to the old response
format.


*05/31/83  (Effective 06/04) TABLE OPTION ADDED TO SHOW DIRECTORY

A new TABLE option has been added to the SHOW DIRECTORY command that
will display the members of a library (without the titles) by
writing as many member names as will fit on a line, instead of
writing one member name per line.


*05/31/83  (Effective 06/04) RETRY (@BREAK) EXTENDED

You can now type @ and then press the BREAK key in response to an
EXEC file prompt to modify the text you have typed at your terminal.
This facility works in the same fashion as typing @BREAK in response
to the command prompt to invoke command retry.  For example:

     Command> exec from #lister
     This is my exec file.
     Enter members? tigers,lions,frodds@<BREAK>
               tigers,lions,frodds
       Mods  >                 xxig
               tigers,lions,frogs
       Mods  >
     JOB 1234 MYJOB    AWAITING PRINT PRIO=9 POS=12 FORMS=1181
     My exec file is done.
     Command>


*05/31/83  (Effective 06/04) HELP AND DESCRIBE COMMANDS EXTENDED

A number of changes have been made to the HELP command to make it
easier to use.  HELP provides you with information on how to use any
WYLBUR command.  The new syntax for the HELP command is:

     HELP [any WYLBUR command]
       or
     HELP '[any WYLBUR command]' [collect-options]

The DESCRIBE command will eventually be phased out, because it now
produces exactly the same response as the HELP command.


*01/28/83  NEW OPTIONS ON FETCH AND LOCATE COMMANDS

Several options have been added to the LOCATE and FETCH
commands.  The new DDS option on LOCATE displays information about
the output of a job broken down by DD statement.  For example, if
you issue a command like LOCATE 1063 DDS, the response would be
something like:

   Num Ddname                  Sysout   Lines  (Job 1063 MARK#274)
     2 LOG                        A        19
     3 JCLLIST                    A        29
     4 JCLMSG                     A        92
     8 GO.FT06F001                A        43
     9 GO.ZETAPLOT                Z       246   Forms=PLOT

NUM      Is a sequence number assigned by the system to each DD
         statement.

DDNAME   Is the name on the DD statement.

SYSOUT   Is the SYSOUT class that was specified on the DD statement.

LINES    Is the number of lines of output in the data set.

(jobid)  The job number and jobname are shown in parentheses.
         In this example, the job number is 1063 and the jobname is
         MARK#274.

Certain "ddnames" above have special meaning and do not actually
appear on DD statements:

LOG      Is the JES2 JOB LOG.

JCLLIST  Is the listing of your job control language (JCL),
         including the expansion of cataloged procedures.

JCLMSG   Is the data set containing system messages about your job.


The new DD and STEP options on FETCH allow you to fetch output by
individual SYSOUT data set or by individual step.  The syntax is:

         FETCH <jobid> DD number
         FETCH <jobid> DD ddname
         FETCH <jobid> DD stepname.ddname
         FETCH <jobid> DD stepname.procstepname.ddname
         FETCH <jobid> STEP stepname
         FETCH <jobid> STEP stepname.procstepname

Following are examples of FETCH commands that include the DD and
STEP options:

  Option                       Command
  ------                       -------
  DD number                    FETCH 1063 DD 2
  DD ddname                    FETCH 1063 DD JCLLIST
  DD stepname.ddname           FETCH 1063 DD GO.FT06F001
  STEP stepname                FETCH 1063 STEP GO

FETCH <jobid> DD LOG is equivalent to FETCH <jobid> LOG.

FETCH <jobid> JCL is equivalent to the combination of FETCH <jobid>
DD JCLLIST and FETCH <jobid> DD JCLMSG.


*01/17/83  SET MAIL COMMAND EXTENDED

Several options have been added to the SET MAIL command.  Issuing
SET MAIL without options allows you to receive electronic mail from
other users.  With the new options, the syntax of the command is:

     SET MAIL [FORWARD gg.uuu|NOFORWARD] ['message']

For a complete description of the SET MAIL command, type DESCRIBE
SET MAIL.  The FORWARD option automatically re-directs mail sent to
your account to another account.  You can issue SET MAIL NOFORWARD
to cancel a SET MAIL FORWARD command and have mail sent to your
account again.

The 'message' option allows you to set a message for your mailbox
that will be displayed each time someone sends you mail.  The
message can be up to 20 characters; it must be enclosed in
quotation marks or apostrophes, for example:

        COMMAND> set mail 'on vacation'
        ...
        COMMAND> mail to e1.abc
        Mail sent to Rodney Crowell <E1.ABC> -- on vacation

You can delete the message by typing SET MAIL '' (without a blank
space between the apostrophes).


*01/17/83  SHOW MAIL COMMAND EXTENDED

A STATUS option has been added to the SHOW MAIL command that allows
you to display your mailbox status (i.e., whether you are receiving,
not receiving, or forwarding your mail and whether you have set a
message), for example:

        COMMAND> show mail status
        New mail is being forwarded to E1.MCP
        Your mail message is: on vacation

Your mailbox status is also displayed each time you issue a SHOW
MAIL command, as the first lines of the response, and each time you
issue a SET MAIL or MAIL command.


*01/03/83  WYLBUR DISK VOLUME CHANGE

If you try to save a data set on a volume that is full, WYLBUR will
now automatically select another volume.  For example, suppose you
want to replace BOOK, a data set saved and cataloged on PUB001:

   COMMAND> save book replace
   BOOK saved on PUB016 (instead of PUB001 which is full)
   COMMAND>

Note that, if necessary, WYLBUR will recatalog the data set.


*12/07/82  (Effective 12/15) CATALOGING IS NOW THE DEFAULT

WYLBUR will now catalog all new data sets that are saved.  (WYLBUR
catalogs a data set by entering the data set name and the volume on
which it is saved in the system catalog, a directory of data sets.)
WYLBUR also automatically selects a volume on which to save the data
set, if you do not specify a volume in the SAVE command or set one
with the SET VOLUME command.  Essentially, the CATALOG option on the
SAVE command has become the default.  In addition, a NOCATALOG
option has been added to SAVE that will allow you to save but not
catalog a new data set.  Since all data sets that are saved will
also be cataloged, the message:

     dsname SAVED AND CATALOGED ON volume

has been shortened to:

     dsname SAVED ON volume

If for some reason WYLBUR cannot catalog the data set, the following
message is displayed:

     dsname SAVED BUT NOT CATALOGED ON volume
     (...additional information...)


*12/07/82  (Effective 12/15) USE COMMAND CHANGED

The USE command has been changed so that whenever you use a data set
and do not explicitly specify a volume (with the "ON volume"
option), WYLBUR will first search the system catalog for the data
set name and the volume on which it is saved.  If the data set is
not cataloged, WYLBUR will use the volume set with the SET VOLUME
command.  If no volume is set, you will be prompted for a volume.


*12/07/82  (Effective 12/15) TEMPORARY OPTION ADDED TO SAVE COMMAND

A TEMPORARY option has been added to the SAVE command that allows
you to save a data set on a temporary volume (e.g., SCR002).  (Users
are not charged for data sets saved on temporary volumes.  However,
each morning, all data sets on those volumes are scratched.)

The command:

     SAVE dsname TEMPORARY

is now the same as the command:

     SAVE dsname ON SCR002

To use a data set that has been saved on a temporary volume, simply
issue the command:

     USE dsname

Since the data set was cataloged when it was saved, it is not
necessary to include the TEMPORARY option on the USE command.  We
encourage users to include the TEMPORARY option instead of
specifying the volume SCR002 on a SAVE command.


*12/07/82  (Effective 12/15) SET VOLUME COMMAND CHANGES

The CATALOG option on the SET VOLUME command has been removed; it is
no longer necessary because of the new cataloging scheme.  Although
the command SET VOLUME CATALOG will be still be accepted, it will
have no effect.

If you have not set a volume and you issue a SAVE command, WYLBUR
will automatically pick a disk volume (e.g., PUB011).  Previously,
WYLBUR would prompt you for a volume.  With this change, and the
cataloging change described above, most users will find that it is
not necessary to issue a SET VOLUME command.


*11/27/82  (Effective 11/27) NEW TITLE OPTION ON THE SAVE COMMAND

A new option, TITLE='text', has been added to the SAVE command.  You
can include it when you are saving a member of a library.  The title
text will be displayed in responses from the SHOW DIRECTORY command.
In addition, the ALL option on SHOW DIRECTORY command can now be
used to display the time and date the member was saved and the
account of the user who saved the data.

For example:

     COMMAND> save lib#memo title 'WYLBUR Changes'
     MEMO SAVED IN LIB
     COMMAND> show directory all
     WYL.N2.F84.LIB
     MEMO                    11:34 11/13/82  N2.F84  WYLBUR Changes


*11/22/82  (Effective 11/27) EXTENSIONS TO WYLBUR MAIL

Several changes have been made to the MAIL facility in WYLBUR.  The
changes made to the MAIL command are transparent (upward
compatible).  In addition, some messages have changed slightly.  The
major change is the introduction of inter-machine mail.  This
mechanism will be used to send mail from the CIT 3081 to the RLIN
3081 and vice-versa.  You can send mail to a user on the RLIN 3081
simply by specifying the account of an RLIN user on the MAIL
command.  RLIN users can do the same when mailing information to CIT
users.  It is our plan that this same mechanism will be used to send
and receive mail between other computers and the CIT 3081.

Two new commands have been added:  SET MAIL and SET NOMAIL.  SET
MAIL creates a mailbox (so that other users can send you mail).
Thus, it is no longer necessary to CATALOG a MAIL data set.  Note
that if you already have a mailbox, you do NOT have to issue a SET
MAIL command or make any other changes.

SET NOMAIL prohibits other users from sending you mail.  NOMAIL is
the default when an account is first opened.


*11/22/82  (Effective 11/27) NEW SHOW LINE AND SHOW LINES FORMATTING

The responses from the SHOW LINE and SHOW LINES commands have been
reformatted so that the terminal id is no longer included.  (You
can still use the SHOW TERMINAL command to display your terminal
id).  In addition, other fields have been changed to a fixed column
format to improve readability.  Lines placed in the active file by a
DUMP LINE or DUMP LINES command will also appear in the new format.


*11/22/82  (Effective 11/27) PAGE PAUSE PROMPT CHANGED

The page pause prompt has been changed from two blanks to a colon
and a blank (: ).  This change was made in response to numerous user
suggestions that a prompt of blanks makes it difficult to tell when
the prompt has been issued.  In addition, a bug has been fixed that
caused too many lines to be written before a pause.  (Remember,
WYLBUR can only count lines correctly if the terminal width is set
accurately.  Type DESCRIBE SET TERMINAL for a description of how to
set terminal width.)


*11/22/82  (Effective 11/27) SET/SHOW NAME COMMAND EXTENDED

The SET NAME command now "permanently" sets your name.  That is, the
command need only be issued once for an account; it lasts across
terminal sessions.  The SHOW NAME command has also been extended so
that you can find out the name associated with another account
(regardless of whether or not the account is currently logged on).
The syntax is:

       SHOW NAME [gg.uuu]

In general, it is a good idea to keep the SET NAME text set to
your personal name (or some text that describes the account).


*11/22/82  (Effective 11/27) SET LINE COMMAND ADDED

A SET LINE command has been added that allows you to change
the "user name" text displayed on the SHOW LINE and SHOW LINES
commands.  The syntax is:

       SET LINE 'text'

The SET LINE command overrides the SET NAME command for the current
terminal session.


*11/22/82  (Effective 11/27) ERROR MESSAGES CLARIFIED

The following error messages have been reworded:

  OLD                          NEW
  ---                          ---
  REQUEST ABORTED              No action taken.
  NO SAVE, <library> FULL      Not enough space in <library>


*11/22/82  (Effective 11/27) MIXED OPTION FOR LIST/PRINT COMMANDS

A MIXED option has been added to the LIST and PRINT commands that
causes all non-printing (control) characters to be displayed in
their EBCDIC hex format, enclosed in angle brackets.  For example,
<270C> represents the two characters x'27' and x'0C'.


*11/22/82  (Effective 11/27) SET KEYWORD COMMAND CHANGED

An additional verification prompt has been added to the SET KEYWORD
command.  Thus, the new keyword has to be entered twice before it
will be set.  For example:

    COMMAND> set keyword
    Enter your current keyword.
    KEYWORD? old
    Enter your new keyword.
    KEYWORD? new
    Enter the same new keyword again for verification.
    KEYWORD? new
    COMMAND>


*11/22/82  (Effective 11/27) ACCOUNT OPTION ADDED TO SET TAPE COMMAND

An ACCOUNT option has been added to the SET TAPE command so that you
can change the status of a tape belonging to another user if you
supply the correct keyword.  For example:

    COMMAND> set tape es1234 release account n2.f84
    KEYWORD? random
    TAPE ES1234 WILL BE RELEASED


*11/22/82  (Postponed) SHOW CATALOG COMMAND EXTENDED
 ******  SHOW CATALOG CHANGE POSTPONED; WATCH NEWS FOR  ******
 ******  RESCHEDULING OF THIS CHANGE                    ******

Several changes have been made to the SHOW CATALOG command.  It now
displays the full data set names instead of the first "index".
For example, if the old response was:

    COMMAND> show catalog
    WYL.N2.F84
    LIB - ON PUB012
    TEMP - INDEX

the new response is:

    COMMAND> show catalog
    LIB - ON PUB012
    TEMP.JUNK - ON SCR002

In addition, the following options have been added to the SHOW
CATALOG command:

NOVOLUME  causes only the data set names to be displayed.

INTERNAL  causes the command responses to be given in the
          following fixed column format:

            columns  1 to  44 - full data set name
            columns 45 to  50 - volume serial
            columns 51 to 235 - reserved for future use



*11/18/82  WYLBUR ERROR MESSAGE EXPLANATIONS NOW AVAILABLE

The online HELP facility now includes explanations for error
messages.  When WYLBUR issues an error message in response to an
aborted command, you can get an explanation of that message by
responding to the next command prompt with a question mark.  For
example, if you issue a LIST command and specify a line number that
is not in your active file:

 COMMAND> list 50
 LINE 50. NOT IN FILE
 COMMAND> ?
 The error message "LINE n. NOT IN FILE" or "LINES m./n. NOT IN FILE"
 is given when you issue a command with an explicit range option
 (e.g., LIST 8/12) and the line (or lines) you specified are not in
 your active file.

There are over 100 explanations and they cover most of the WYLBUR
error messages.  If you have questions or comments about this
addition to the HELP facility, send a suggestion via the SUGGEST
command with the subject WYLBUR (e.g., SUGGEST WYLBUR).


*08/30/82  TERMINAL ID WILL NO LONGER BE REQUIRED

Effective September 5, you will no longer have to enter a Terminal
ID to logon to the 3081.  The ACCOUNT? prompt will replace TERMINAL?
as the first prompt you see at logon.  It will still be possible to
enter a Terminal ID in response to ACCOUNT?  For example, the
following logon sequence:

        ACCOUNT? z99 e1.abc
        KEYWORD? ********

will set the Terminal ID to "Z99" and the account to "E1.ABC".
Within several months entering a Terminal ID will not be allowed at
logon.

If you have comments or questions concerning this change, please let
us know via the SUGGEST WYLBUR command.


*08/03/82  ACCOUNT KEYWORD EXTENDED TO 8 CHARACTERS

Your account keyword can now be from 3 to 8 characters in length.
Previously, the maximum length was 3 characters.  As before, your
keyword cannot contain any imbedded blanks or non-printable
characters.  We encourage you to take advantage of this change in
keyword length, since it enhances your account security.

Effective Saturday, August 7, for those terminals that mask out
characters typed in response to the KEYWORD? prompt, 8 characters
will be masked out (regardless of the actual length of the keyword).
Until that time, only three characters will be masked out.


*05/21/82  NEW WYLBUR "FETYPE" VARIABLE

A new preprocessor variable FETYPE will be added to WYLBUR on
Saturday, May 22.  The FETYPE variable will indicate the type of
front-end processor in use for a WYLBUR session.  The variable will
return one of the following:
   PDP     - PDP-11 front-end processor being used
   ASYNC   - Memorex 1270 front-end processor being used
   VTAM    - VTAM/SNA front-end software (for IBM 327x terminals)
   VIRTUAL - Batch job simulating a real terminal

We had previously installed this variable as FTYPE.  In order to
avoid any confusion with SLAC's VM WYLBUR (which has a FTYPE
variable for a different purpose), the name will be changed to
FETYPE.  For the next two months FTYPE and FETYPE will both work.
EXEC files and BATWYL jobs that use the variable FTYPE should be
modified to use FETYPE.


*04/13/82  MULTIPLE LOGONS FOR ONE ACCOUNT NOW AVAILABLE

It is now possible for two or more people to logon simultaneously to
the same account.  Note that active file recovery is only possible
for the first person to logon to an account.  Thus, when you logon
to an account that is already in use, the following is displayed
after you type in the account:

   ACCOUNT gg.uuu IS ALREADY LOGGED ON
   NO ACTIVE FILE RECOVERY WILL BE POSSIBLE THIS SESSION
   OK TO PROCEED?

If you respond YES or OK the logon sequence continues; anything
else causes a return to the ACCOUNT? prompt.

You can identify the sessions for an account with multiple logons by
using the SHOW LINE or SHOW LINES command.  WYLBUR's response to
these commands includes a number sign and a number following the
account.  This session number is also part of the header in a
message sent by a TO command.  In addition, you can include it
when sending a message with the TO command.

For example:

   COMMAND> show line
   LINE  21 C25 XA.ZZZ#2 ON 1270D-C76 (GANDALF) (120CPS) (G3,P-0236)

   COMMAND> show account
   XA.ZZZ - LOGGED ON ACCOUNT

   COMMAND> show value account
   'ZZZ$XA'

   COMMAND> show lines xa.zzz
   LINE  21 C25 XA.ZZZ#2 ON 1270D-C76 (GANDALF) (120CPS) (G3,P-0236)
   LINE   7 L50 XA.ZZZ   ON 11A-YH1.00 (GANDALF) (120CPS) (G1,P-0030) (NOTIME)

   COMMAND> to xa.wln#4  It's time for lunch.
   15:14 FROM XA.WLN#4 (145): OK, all set.

Existing accounts do not allow multiple logons.  You can request the
multiple logon capability for new or existing accounts at the CIT
Accounting Office in Forsythe Hall.  All requests must include the
signature of the account sponsor.


*11/17/81  NEW COMMAND: SHOW QUEUE

A new command, SHOW QUEUE, displays the current system backlog.  For
a complete description of the command syntax, type DESCRIBE SHOW
QUEUE.  Some examples of the available options for the SHOW QUEUE
command are listed below:

     SHOW QUEUE EXEC           - current execution backlog
                SETUP          - setup backlog
                CLASS=c        - backlog for specified class
                PLOT           - backlog for Versatec plotter
                PUNCH          - backlog for card punch
                FORMS=ffff     - print backlog for specified forms
                DEST=dddd      - backlog for specified DEST code
                                 (examples: DEST=SELF or DEST=RMTn)
                BLOCK=b        - backlog for specified time block

If no time block is specified, jobs queued for processing in the
current time block are displayed.

Multiple options can be combined in one command.  For example:

     SHOW QUEUE SETUP CLASS=B      - shows class B setup backlog


*08/20/81  CHANGE IN LOGON MESSAGE ON SUNDAY, AUGUST 23

Effective Sunday, August 23, the message that appears at the
beginning of a logon sequence will change from:

  STANFORD IBM-3033A (PORT 1270C-683) 22:32:03 08/19/81

to:

  Stanford University Network (SUN):  Welcome to the 3033A


In addition, certain general information commands will now
be allowed before you logon.  The commands that can be entered
in response to the "TERMINAL?" or "ACCOUNT?" prompt include:

           SHOW USERS                SET KEYWORD gg.uuu
           SHOW LINES                LOCATE jobid
           HELP                      SHOW STATUS jobid
           DESCRIBE


*08/20/81  UPLOW BECOMES THE WYLBUR DEFAULT ON SUNDAY, AUGUST 23

Effective Sunday, August 23, UPLOW will become the WYLBUR default.
That is, WYLBUR will keep  your text in whatever case you enter it
in (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, or a combination of both).  This
change will be evident because WYLBUR command and line number prompts
will end with a right angle bracket.  For example:  14.> and
COMMAND>.

This also means that if you want all the text you enter in WYLBUR
to be automatically converted to uppercase, regardless of the
case you enter it in, you must either issue the command
SET TERMINAL UPPER or include that command in your Logon EXEC file.

*04/20/81  ONLINE HELP FACILITY AVAILABLE

The online HELP facility now contains information on most of the
commands in the old WYLBUR Reference Manual and on changes made to
WYLBUR since the last revision of the manual (April 1977).  HELP
provides details about the syntax, function, and options of WYLBUR
commands; it also includes explanations of some terminology (e.g.,
dsname, line-number) and guides to further assistance (e.g., phones,
consulting, news).

To use the facility, issue the HELP command, specifying the command
or topic you want help with (e.g., HELP MODIFY to get the syntax of
the MODIFY command).  To get more detailed information on a command
or topic, use the DESCRIBE command (e.g., DESCRIBE MODIFY).

For a complete explanation on the use of the facility, issue the
following commands:


     HELP            provides general information on how to access
                     the HELP facility.

     DESCRIBE HELP   gives a complete explanation of how to use
                     the HELP facility.

     DESCRIBE        gives an explanation of the DESCRIBE command.

The following commands provide lists of the commands and topics that
are currently available in HELP:


     HELP COMMANDS   lists the commands available in HELP.

     HELP SET        lists the SET commands available in HELP.

     HELP SHOW       lists the SHOW commands available in HELP.

     HELP TOPICS     lists the topics available in HELP.

You can get a printed copy of any command or topic contained in HELP
by issuing a HELP or DESCRIBE command with a collect-option (e.g.,
HELP DSNAME COLLECT, DESCRIBE LOGON COLLECT).  Once the information
is in your active file, issue the PRINT command.

To get a printed copy of the complete HELP facility, issue the
command:  PRINT FROM WYLMAN PUBLIC.  HELP will be printed on Forms
9511, with the commands and topics in alphabetical order, and with a
format similar to other C.I.T. documents.  HELP currently contains
about 10,000 lines and costs approximately $7.00 to print.

Both the online HELP facility and the WYLBUR User's Guide supplement
the currently out-of-print WYLBUR Reference Manual.  At one time,
DOC#WYLBUR PUBLIC contained all WYLBUR changes since the last
revision of the reference manual.  Because those changes have been
incorporated into HELP and the User's Guide, DOC#WYLBUR has been
updated to contain only the most recent WYLBUR changes (since
October 1980).  (The old version of DOC#WYLBUR is now available as
DOC#OLDWYL PUBLIC.)  HELP will form the basis for a new WYLBUR
Reference Manual planned for Fall Quarter 1981.


*01/06/81  (EFFECTIVE 01/19) CHANGES TO WYLBUR DSNAME CONVENTIONS

Beginning Monday, January 19, WYLBUR will no longer allow you to
specify non-standard OS data set names (on commands such as USE,
SAVE, etc.) unless the data set name is enclosed in quotes.  Since
data sets with non-standard names can cause JCL errors and will not
be accessible by most batch programs and utilities, we encourage
users to specify only standard data set names.

The OS standard data set naming convention is as follows:

    . dsname can only contain the characters 0-9, A-Z, or a
      national character ($, #, and @)

    . first character must be alphabetic or a national character

    . dsname can not exceed eight characters, unless the characters
      are separated by a period (.).  If the data set name does
      contain more than eight characters, the first character after
      each period must be an alphabetic or national character.

For example, LONGFILENAME and 4CLASS are both invalid OS data set
names.

Because of this change in specifying data set names, WYLBUR will no
longer assume that a data set name enclosed in quotes is a fully-
qualified dsname.  The only difference between a quoted and an
unquoted dsname will be that a quoted dsname need not have a standard
name.  For example, the commands:

    SAVE SONGS

and...

    SAVE "SONGS"

are equivalent.  However, the commands:

    SAVE LONGFILENAME

and...

    SAVE "LONGFILENAME"

are not equivalent.  WYLBUR will not accept the first command,
SAVE LONGFILENAME, because the data set name is non-standard.


*10/20/80  PAGE/PAUSE MODE NOW AVAILABLE

A page/pause mode has been added which causes the system to
automatically stop writing information to the terminal after a
pre-defined number of lines.  On CRT terminals, this gives the user
time to read the information before it scrolls off the screen.  To
continue after a "page/pause", press carriage-return and the system
will resume writing the information.

To activate this facility, issue the command:

         SET HEIGHT n

where "n" is the maximum number of lines to be written before the
system pauses.  The command:

         SET HEIGHT 0
          -or-
         SET NOHEIGHT

will disable the page/pause feature (this is the initial value at
logon).


*10/20/80  RANGE EXTENDED -- C'string' ADDED

The WYLBUR "range" options which are available on the editing
commands have been extended.  The extension allows the user to match
an associative range regardless of the case (upper, lower, or a
mixture of upper and lower).  Use the notation:

         C'string'

For example:

         ? list c'campus'
             1.      THE CAMPUS COMPUTER CENTER
             5.      Here at Campus, we all eat bananas
            12.      CaMPuS Facility!

The CHANGE command will also allow C'string' as the subject of the
change.  For example:

         ? change c'campus' to 'C.I.T.'
             1.      THE C.I.T. COMPUTER CENTER

*10/20/80  "*" AS DSNAME DEFINITION CHANGED

A number of inconsistencies have been corrected in the definition of
"*" as a dsname.  With the new definition, "*" refers to the
complete data set name and volume of the last data set to be used
(or the last time the PREFIX was set).

To avoid inadvertently replacing the "*" data set with new unrelated
data, any time the Active file is cleared, "*" will also be reset.

For example:

         COMMAND? use temp user abc on scr002
         COMMAND? number
         12. - LAST LINE
         COMMAND? save * replace
         WYL.GG.ABC.TEMP NOT YOURS
         OK? ok
         WYL.GG.ABC.TEMP REPLACED ON SCR002
         COMMAND? collect clear
             1.   ? testing one, two, three
             2.   ? ***(BREAK/ATTN)
         COMMAND? save * replace
         * IS UNDEFINED AS DSNAME
         COMMAND?

For EXEC files, the pre-processor variable "PREFIX" will refer to
the fully-qualified "*" dsname, and the variable "PVOLUME" will
refer to the volume on which the dsname resides.


*10/20/80  SYSTEM DATA SETS EASIER TO USE

WYLBUR has been changed to assume that any data set beginning with:
         SYSn.
is a system data set (and therefore fully qualified).  WYLBUR will
also assume that it is cataloged.  This means that these two
commands are now equivalent:

         COMMAND? use sys4.proclib#ioprogm
and...
         COMMAND? use $sys4.proclib#ioprogm on catalog


*10/18/80  SHOW SIZE COMMAND EXTENDED

The SHOW SIZE command has been extended to provide more information
when no lines are found meeting the specified conditions.  When the
OVER or UNDER option is specified, either the length of the longest
or shortest line encountered will be reported.

For example:

         COMMAND? show size over 30
         NO LINES OVER 30, LONGEST WAS 23
         COMMAND? show size under 20
         NO LINES UNDER 20, SHORTEST WAS 21
         COMMAND?


*10/20/80  SET ACCOUNT COMMAND ADDED

A new SET ACCOUNT command has been added to allow the user to set a
default account other than the logged on user's when processing
commands.  This function is identical to the function of the SET
USER and SET GROUP commands.  Note that this does not effect the
charging of the logged on user.

The syntax for the command is:

         SET ACCOUNT [gg.uuu] [KEYWORD]


*10/20/80  SHOW TAPE COMMAND NOW ALLOWS ACCOUNT OPTION

The SHOW TAPE command now allows you to display the status of
another user's tape, if the user's keyword can correctly be
provided.  The syntax for the command is:

         SHOW TAPE tape [ACCOUNT gg.uuu]


The "ACCOUNT" option is NOT supported on the "SET TAPE" command.


*10/20/80  SHOW SPACE AND SHOW TRACKS COMMAND CHANGES

The SHOW SPACE and SHOW TRACKS command functions have been divided
so that the "SHOW SPACE" command will now report the user's disk
space usage and the "SHOW TRACKS" command will now report the number
of free tracks on a disk volume.  The syntax for these commands are
as follows:

         SHOW SPACE [gg.uuu]
and...
         SHOW TRACKS [ON volume]

Note that for compatibility, the "SHOW SPACE ON volume" command is
still accepted.


*09/23/80  WYLBUR WILL RECOGNIZE "SYS" DATA SET NAMES

If a data set name in any WYLBUR command begins with SYSn. (where
"n" is any digit), WYLBUR will now assume that it is a fully
qualified name.  This means that it is no longer necessary to prefix
such names with $.  For example, to obtain a copy of the cataloged
procedure FORTCG, you can issue the command:
  USE SYS4.PROCLIB#FORTCG ON CAT
Formerly, the command would have been issued as:
  USE $SYS4.PROCLIB#FORTCG ON CAT
The old way is still valid.  When naming your own data sets, however,
avoid names that begin with SYSn. to prevent confusion.


*07/01/80  CHANGE TO "*" AS JOBID ON HASP COMMANDS

The definition of "*" as a jobid has been changed for the HASP
commands (LOCATE, FETCH, ALTER, etc.), if those commands are entered
through WYLBUR.  (For commands passed to HASP using the JOBCTRL
program,"*" will continue to work as it has in the past.) In the new
scheme, WYLBUR remembers the job-numbers of the last four jobs
submitted.  Therefore, specifying "*" is equivalent to specifying the
job-number of the last job submitted, and the "-n" notation refers to
the previous jobs regardless of the jobnames used.  For example:

         ? print
         JOB 1234 UUUGG011 AWAITING PRINT...
         ? print jobname jim
         JOB 1236 JIM      AWAITING PRINT...
         ? locate *
         JOB 1236 JIM      AWAITING PRINT...
         ? locate *-1
         JOB 1234 UUUGG011 AWAITING PRINT...
         ? locate *-2
         *-2 IS UNDEFINED


*07/01/80  MESSAGE GIVEN WHEN MODIFY/EDIT ABORTS

A new information message has been added when WYLBUR MODIFY or EDIT
changes are not made because the user hits BREAK/ATTN to abort the
command.  For example:

         ? modify 1
             1.     Dear Mom,
            MODS  ?         r and Dad,
             1.     Dear Mom and Dad,
            MODS  ? ***(BREAK/ATTN)
         LINE WAS NOT CHANGED
         ? list 1
              1.    Dear Mom,


*07/01/80  (EFFECTIVE 07/03) SUGGEST COMMAND IMPROVED

Users who are using the SUGGEST command to send printed output to
another account by using the command:

         SUGGEST TO gg.uuu

should start using the command:

         PRINT TO gg.uuu

in the future.  The user will not be forced to change.  However,
"PRINT TO..." is now the recommended syntax for this function.


The more common usage for the SUGGEST command has been to send a
suggestion to the computer center staff.  Several changes have been
made to improve this command.  The new SUGGEST command now uses the
WYLBUR MAIL facility.  The syntax for the SUGGEST command is:

         SUGGEST [range] subject

As before, the suggestion must already be in the active file when
the suggest command is issued.  The "subject" can be specified to
categorize the suggestion so that it can be sent to the appropriate
person immediately.  If you enter "?" as a subject, a list of
available subjects will be given.  If you don't know which subject
to use, use "GENERAL" and it will be sent to the appropriate person
(although, it may take a bit longer).  Each suggestion is assigned a
four-digit number.  Please use this number if you inquire about the
status of your suggestion.  If you have a mailbox, the reply will be
mailed to you using WYLBUR MAIL.

A sample suggestion might be:

    ? collect
        1.   ? would you like to buy my used computer?  (cheap)
        2.   ? ***(BREAK/ATTN)
    ? suggest
    WHAT SUBJECT (TYPE "?" FOR A LIST)? general
    1234 IS YOUR SUGGESTION NUMBER


*07/01/80  ACTIVE FILE SIZE INCREASED

WYLBUR has now been changed to ensure that any single user of the
system does not use an excessive amount of high-speed drum paging
space.  As a result, we can now increase the maximum allowable size
of the active file without impacting users.  The ACTIVE file can now
contain up to 2.7 million characters of data (this is about 30,000
lines each containing 90 characters).  This is an increase of 285%
(the previous limitation was .7 million characters).


*07/01/80  NOTIFY BECOMES THE DEFAULT FOR CONDENSE

On July 1st, the NOTIFY option will become the default for the
CONDENSE command.  When the CONDENSE job has completed, the user
will get the message:

    12:20 JOB 1234 UUUCOND END EXECUTION: CONDENSE=0

If this message is not wanted, the user must explicitly specify
"NONOTIFY" on the CONDENSE command.


*06/23/80  NOTIFY Option Added to RUN and SET JES Commands

A new facility has been added to the system to allow a terminal user
to receive a notification message when a batch job finishes
execution.  A new WYLBUR command:

    SET JES NOTIFY

activates the notify facility for the duration of your terminal
session.


The notify message will have one of the following formats:

    JOB 1234 TEST END EXECUTION: JOB FAILED, JCL ERROR
    JOB 1234 TEST END EXECUTION: FORT=0, LKED=0, GO=0
    JOB 1234 TEST END EXECUTION: FORT=0, LKED=8
    JOB 1234 TEST END EXECUTION: FORT=0, LKED=0, GO=ABEND S322
    JOB 1234 TEST END EXECUTION: FORT-STEP FAILED, ALLOCATION ERROR

The message gives the completion code for each step which was
executed.  If a step has no name then the program name from the
EXEC statement will be used instead.  The last form of the
message indicates that the job terminated because of an error
during the allocation process which precedes the execution of the
step.  This could be caused by duplicate data set on volume, disk
space unavailable, incorrect device specification, etc.

If a job step is bypassed because of a condition code test, it
will not appear in the message.  Up to 8 steps will be shown; if
a job executes more, then only the last 8 steps will appear.

A convention has been established to allow excluding steps from
the notify message.  If the step name begins with one '$', it
will be excluded if it completes with a return code of 0.  If the
step name begins with '$$', it will be excluded unless it abends
or fails because of an allocation error.

The notify message is sent to the terminal when the job finishes
execution.  It will not be sent if the user is not logged on or
is not accepting messages at that time.


The complete list of new NOTIFY options on the SET JES command are:

    SET JES NOTIFY           - activates notification, and sets the
                                 notify account to the logged on
                                 account
    SET JES NOTIFY GG.UUU    - activates notification, and sets the
                                 notify account as specified
    SET JES NONOTIFY         - notification is not requested
    SET JES NONOTIFY GG.UUU  - sets the notify account, but does
                                 not activate notification

Note that the notify account is independent of the account a job
is run under.  Thus you can receive the notify message for a job
regardless of the account on the JOB card.  Also, the NOTIFY
option for a job is set when the job is submitted.  Changing the
SET JES NOTIFY options will not affect jobs which have already
been submitted.

The NOTIFY option can also be used on the RUN command, to request
specific notification options for a particular job.  If SET JES
NOTIFY is in effect, then RUN NOTIFY is the default.  The new
options are:

  RUN NOTIFY               - send notify message for this job, to
                              account specified by SET JES NOTIFY
  RUN NOTIFY GG.UUU        - send notification to specified account
  RUN NONOTIFY             - no notification requested for job


A NOTIFY option has also been added to the HASP /*JOBPARM card.
The syntax is shown below:

  NOTIFY=GG.UUU            - send notify message to specified
  NOTIFY=(GG.UUU,...)          account (up to 4 may be specified)
  NOTIFY=YES               - send notification message (default
                               account is job account)
  NOTIFY=NO                - don't send notify message


*06/23/80  ALLOCATE Command Added

A new ALLOCATE command has been added to WYLBUR to provide an easy
mechanism for allocating a WYLBUR library (partioned data set).  The
syntax for the command is:

    ALLOCATE dsname ON volume [CATALOG] [TRACKS n]
                    [BLOCKS n|SEQUENTIAL] [ds type]

where:

dsname   the name of the data set to be allocated.

ON volume
        the name of the disk volume where the data set is to reside.

CATALOG  causes the data set to be cataloged.

TRACKS n
         the number of tracks to assign to the data set.  If
         omitted, 10 tracks is assumed.  (One track of data is
         19,069 characters on a 3350 disk.)

BLOCKS n
         the number of directory blocks to be assigned.  If omitted,
         either 10 or 1/2 the number of tracks, which ever is
         larger, will be used.  Unless you are planning to have an
         unusually large number of members (e.g., over 150) in
         the library, this number need not be specified.  For more
         information on directories and estimating the number of
         directory blocks needed see the document "Using WYLBUR
         Libraries".

SEQUENTIAL
         causes a sequential data set to be allocated.

ds type  causes the data set type to be set to a particular data set
         format (e.g., EDIT, CARD).  See the WYLBUR Manual for a
         description of this option.


*06/23/80  LOGON Procedure Improved

On June 1st the "USER?" prompt was changed to "ACCOUNT?" in an
attempt to use a more consistent terminology.  In addition, several
other extensions have been made to the logon process, they are:

    *  A response of just ? to any prompt during logon will result
       in a getting a brief description of what the prompt means.

    *  The user can enter his/her name at logon by entering the name
       in quotes after the account.  (This information is displayed
       in the SHOW LINES response and TO/MAIL headers.)

    *  All the logon prompts can be answered on a single line.  For
       example, the logon sequence:

           TERMINAL? z99
           ACCOUNT? xa.niz "A. User"
           KEYWORD? key

       can equivalently be entered as:

           TERMINAL? z99 xa.niz "A. User" / key

For a complete description of the logon process see the document
"How to Logon and Logoff the 3033 Processor".


*06/23/80  Online MAIL Facility Added

Some time ago an online WYLBUR MAIL facility was introduced.  This
facility allows users to send one or more line messages to another
user, even if the user is not currently logged on.

Before you can receive mail from other users you must first catalog
a data set called "MAIL" on a valid volume.  For example:

    CATALOG MAIL ON PUB002

When other users send you mail, WYLBUR will save the text in this
data set.  WYLBUR will automatically display any new mail when you
first logon, or whenever you issue the "SHOW MAIL" command.

The SEND command can be used to send one line messages.  The SEND
command only sends the text on the command line.  The syntax is
basically the same as the TO command, which is:

    SEND account(s) text

where "account(s)" is the account or accounts of the recipient(s).
If the account is in the same group as the logged on user then just
the user-id (uuu) can be given.  Otherwise, the full account
(gg.uuu) must be used.  If multiple accounts are specified then they
must be enclosed in parentheses.

The MAIL command can be used to MAIL all or part of the Active file.
The syntax for the command is:

    MAIL [range] TO account(s) [TITLE 'text'] [NONOTIFY] [QUIET]

See the document "Using WYLBUR MAIL" for a complete description of
the online mail system.


*06/23/80  Terminal Handling Improved

MILTEN (the terminal control program that handles communications
between terminals and the computer) has been re-written and the new
version was installed in April.  This new MILTEN corrects several
long-standing problem areas and allows for continued expansion (for
example, the addition of new ports).  Several of the basic terminal
handling capabilities have been improved.  The improvements include:

  *  MILTEN commands (such as SHOW LINES) are now processed by
     WYLBUR (previously they were directly processed by MILTEN).
     Since MILTEN no longer separately processes commands it is now
     possible to direct the command responses to the active file
     (e.g., DUMP LINES).

  *  MILTEN's I/O buffer allocation scheme is now dynamic.  In
     addition to reducing the overall memory requirements, this
     means that the user will no longer have to re-enter lines which
     are "too long" (previously MILTEN would lose the input and type
     "***").  Users can now enter up to 235 characters (maximum
     WYLBUR line length) as commands or as lines in the Active file.

  *  The problem with MILTEN misinterpreting the "{" character is
     now fixed.  Users will be able to enter this character from any
     terminal.  Previously MILTEN would treat this character as a
     transmission error from some terminals.

  *  When a user's typing is interrupted by a TO message (or a
     SYSTEM message) the user will be re-prompted with the original
     input text so that he can complete the line.  Because of the
     hardware implementation, the last 1-3 characters typed may get
     lost.  For example:

          COMMAND? show dsna###

          12:02 FROM GG.UUU (12): IT'S LUNCH TIME

          COMMAND? SHOW DS

     (Note that the last two characters typed ("na") were lost in
     the above example.)


*06/23/80  TO Command Extended

The TO command has been re-done.  The syntax is:

    TO account(s) message

The TO command sends a message to another logged on user (or users).
Unlike the old TO command, the new TO command will not actually wait
for the message to be typed out at the receiver's terminal.  Also,
if the user-id is not unique, WYLBUR will list the users that match
and prompt for a specific user.


*06/23/80  SHOW USERS Command Extended

The SHOW USERS command has been re-done.  The syntax is:

    SHOW USERS [line-range]

The SHOW USERS command displays the accounts of the users who are
currently logged on.  The accounts are displayed in the "gg.uuu"
format and are sorted so that users in the same group are displayed
together.

The line-range options are described in the section below.  Some
examples of "line-range" on the SHOW USERS command are:

    SHOW USERS GROUP XA            displays the accounts of just the
                                   logged on users in group XA.

    SHOW USERS GROUP X             displays the accounts of just the
                                   logged on users in groups
                                   beginning with X.

    SHOW USERS DIAL                displays the accounts of just the
                                   users who are using dial-up ports


*06/23/80  SHOW LINE/LINES Commands Extended

The SHOW LINE command displays just the current session, and the
SHOW LINES command displays all the sessions.  The format of the
responses have been changed to include more information about the
port which connects your terminal to the computer.  The new format
is:

    LINE   n gg.uuu   "name" ON port-name (actual location)

where:

n        MILTEN line number.  This is a unique number assigned to
         each logged on user.

gg.uuu   User's account.

"name"   User's name (may not be present since this is optional).

port-name
         This identifies the path which connects your terminal to
         the computer.  This is the information that Data
         Communications will need to identify a bad port.

(actual location)
         For direct ports this will be the actual location of the
         terminal.  For dial-ups this will be the phone-number.

Some examples are:

    LINE  12 GG.UUU   "John Q. User"  ON 1270A-032 (DIAL) (328-4001)
    LINE  17 HG.JDN   ON 1270C-687 (DIRECT) (PUBLIC AREA)


The sessions listed in the SHOW LINES response are listed in the
order in which the users logon (with the most recent first).  This
is to allow the user to stop the responses when he gets to lines he
has already seen before.


The line-range options are described in detail in the section below.
Some examples of "line-range" on the SHOW LINE/LINES commands are:

    SHOW LINES GROUP G             displays the sessions of just the
                                   logged on users in group G.

    SHOW LINES TRAN                displays the sessions of just the
                                   logged on users connected via the
                                   TRAN switch.

    SHOW LINE 12                   displays the session with MILTEN
                                   line number 12.

    SHOW LINE (GG.ABC,GG.DEF)      displays the session with an
                                   account of GG.ABC and the session
                                   with an account of GG.DEF.

line-range description

The "line-range" options are used to identify a particular set of
users on the TO, SHOW USERS, and SHOW LINE/LINES commands.  The
syntax for the line-range is:

         n|uuu|gg.uuu|uuu$gg|'name'|tid|(...,...,...)
                 [GROUP gg|g] [DIAL|TRAN|DIRECT|VIRTUAL]

where:

n        MILTEN line-number to match.

uuu      user-id to match.

gg.uuu   account to match.
(or uuu$gg)

'name'   user name to match.

tid      terminal id to match.

(...,...,...)
         multiple items (as described above) are allowed when
         enclosed in parentheses.

GROUP gg|g
         group code (or first character of group code) to match.

DIAL     matches users connected via dial-up ports.

TRAN     matches users connected via Tran switch.

DIRECT   matches users connected directly (terminals with dedicated
         ports).

VIRTUAL  matches users running as "virtual terminals" (i.e., batch
         jobs).


*06/23/80  SET/SHOW NAME Commands Added

The SET and SHOW NAME commands have been added.  The syntax is:

    SET NAME ['name']
      and
    SHOW NAME

The SET NAME command can be used the set the user name.  The user
name can be up to 20 characters long.  It will be displayed in the
SHOW LINES response and TO/MAIL message headers.  In addition, the
"programmer name" field of jobs submitted will be filled in with the
user name (if otherwise blank).

A new "NAME" pre-processor variable has been added to return the
current user name.  If a user hasn't set a name, the null string
will be returned.

NOTE:  This replaces the little used WYLBUR "SET NAME" command which
was used to set 'pieces' of the saved dsname.  The SET and SHOW
PREFIX commands can be used to do exactly the same thing as the old
SET NAME command.  However, for temporary compatibility, if the name
on the SET NAME command is not quoted a warning message saying the
text will be interpreted as a dataset name prefix will be given.


*06/23/80  SET/SHOW SUBGROUP Commands Added

The SET and SHOW SUBGROUP commands have been added.  The syntax is:

    SET SUBGROUP [s|ss]
      and
    SHOW SUBGROUP

The subgroup is the two character suffix to the group code which can
be used by the user for accounting purposes.  Previously, the
subgroup was set by using the "SET ACCOUNT" command.  The SET
ACCOUNT command is still accepted, but the SET SUBGROUP command is
now recommended instead.

A new SUBGROUP pre-processor variable has been added to return the
current subgroup.  If the user hasen't set a subgroup, the null
string will be returned.


*06/23/80  SET/SHOW TERMINAL Commands Added

The SET and SHOW TERMINAL commands are used to change/display the
terminal dependent options.  The SHOW TERMINAL command lists all the
terminal options in effect (this information in also now displayed
in a separate section on the SHOW OPTIONS command response).

The SET TERMINAL command syntax is:

    SET TERMINAL [ID tid] [WIDTH n] [TIMEOUT|NOTIME]
                 [MSG|NOMSG] [COMM|NOCOMM] [BREAK|NOBREAK]
                 [BACK|NOBACK] [UPPER|UPLOW] [APL|NOAPL]
                 [FAST|SLOW] [XON|NOXON]

where:

ID tid   the three character C.I.T. terminal id

WIDTH n  the number of characters the terminal can fit on one line
         (for most CRT terminals the width is 80 characters).

TIMEOUT|NOTIME
         TIMEOUT specifies that the user will be logged off after
         a period of inactivity (currently 20 minutes).  NOTIME
         disables this function.  TIMEOUT is the logon default.

MSG|NOMSG
         NOMSG prohibits any messages from being received at the
         terminal.  Even operator and system messages are blocked
         in this mode.  Users wishing to block messages from other
         users (but not the operator) should use "NOCOMM" instead.
         MSG is the logon default.

COMM|NOCOMM
         NOCOMM prohibits user messages from being received at the
         terminal.  COMM is the logon default.

BREAK|NOBREAK
         NOBREAK prohibits your typing from being interrupted to type
         a message from another user.  Instead, the message will be
         typed after the input line is completed.  BREAK is the logon
         default.

BACK|NOBACK
         BACK allows the user to enter the backspace character as
         data.  In NOBACK mode, a backspace character is
         interpreted as a deletion of the previous character.
         NOBACK is the logon default.

UPPER|UPLOW
         In UPPER mode all input text is automatically converted to
         uppercase.  In UPLOW mode the case of the input will not be
         changed.  UPPER is the logon default.

APL|NOAPL
         APL provides the correct translation for APL terminals.
         NOAPL provides the standard translation.  NOAPL is the
         logon default.

FAST|SLOW
         FAST causes the pre-set tabs to be used (instead of
         multiple blanks) when writing output lines to speed up
         the process.  SLOW disables this function.  FAST is the
         logon default.

XON|NOXON
         For microprocessor users.  In XON mode the last character
         of every terminal read is the "XON" control character.  In
         NOXON mode, no special prompt ending character is added.
         XON is the logon default.


*06/23/80  SET IDLES Command Added

A new "SET IDLES" command has been added.  This command controls the
number of idle characters added by the system after the
carriage-return, line-feed, and tab functions.  The logon default is
to have NO idles characters generated.  Idle characters are required
by some terminals to allow time for the terminal to perform the
function.  (The system uses the ASCII "NUL" character as an idle.)
The syntax for the command is:

    SET IDLES
       or
    SET IDLES n

where "n" is a multiplication factor for the standard idle times
used.  For example:

    SET IDLES 2                    sets twice the standard number of
                                   idles.

    SET IDLES .5                   sets half the standard number of
                                   idles.

Note:  For many terminals that do require idles, the command "SET
IDLES 1" (or just "SET IDLES") will produce a sufficient number of
idle characters.


*03/11/80  MAIL FACILITY IN WYLBUR NOW AVAILABLE

As announced in our January Bulletin, WYLBUR now has a MAIL facility
that allows Campus Facility terminal users to send, receive and store
messages.  Unlike the simple terminal message invoked by the TO
command or the printing capability of SUGGEST, information sent
through MAIL will be stored online whether or not the recipient is
logged on.  You can get your MAIL automatically at logon or ask to
read or print it at any time.  For further details, see the document
"Using WYLBUR MAIL" now available in Document Sales.


*01/25/80  NEW MILTEN COMING

MILTEN is the terminal control program that controls communications
between terminals and the computer.  A new version of MILTEN will be
installed within the next week or so.  Once this version is installed
there will be a system message to that effect and details of the new
features will be made available.

Changes to MILTEN will include:
- Input lines will no longer be lost if you type in a line with
  too many characters (or backspace too much).  Previously,
  MILTEN would type "***" and your input on that line would be lost.
- You will be able to enter the character "{" from ALL terminals.
  Previously, MILTEN would say "RETYPE" and input would be lost
  on some terminals.
- When a TO message (or system message) interrupts your typing,
  MILTEN will re-prompt you with your original input text so that
  you can complete the line.
- The format of the "SHOW LINES" command response will be different.

If you have any problems with the MILTEN changes, please use the
WYLBUR SUGGEST command to report them.


*01/09/80  WYLBUR "VOID RANGE" and "VOID CHANGE" Messages Change

In an attempt to make WYLBUR error messages a little easier to
understand, the wording of the "VOID RANGE" and "VOID CHANGE"
messages will be changed on Wednesday evening (1/9) as follows:

    OLD                     NEW
    ---                     ---
    VOID RANGE              LINE n. NOT IN FILE
     " "  " "               LINES n., m. NOT IN FILE
     " "  " "               LINES n./m. NOT IN FILE
     " "  " "               NO LINES IN RANGE
    VOID CHANGE             NOTHING FOUND TO CHANGE


*10/24/79  (EFFECTIVE 11/02) PRINT COMMAND SUPERSEDES LIST OFFLINE

An error message is given when the LIST OFFLINE command is  used:

      USE "PRINT" COMMAND INSTEAD

Error messages are also given if "(n)" is used instead of
"INDENT=n" or "'title'" instead of "TITLE='title'".


*10/24/79  (EFFECTIVE 11/02) HASP "$" TYPE COMMANDS ADDED

 $DP     displays the status of printers (this is a subset of the
         information returned on the $DU command)

 $DPRTn  displays the status of a particular printer.  For example:
               $DPRT1

          displays the status of PRINTER1 (the 3800 printer).


*10/24/79  (EFFECTIVE 11/02) PRINT OPTIONS ON HEADER PAGE

PRINT (or PUNCH) options are displayed on the header page of output.
Options may be those given on the command or taken from an
"OPTIONS:" line.


*10/24/79  (EFFECTIVE 11/02) SHOW CHARGES COMMAND CHANGES

The SHOW CHARGES command response now includes the month-to-date
charges in addition to the year-to-date charges.  The date when the
charges were last calculated will also be shown along with the
dollar amount added at that time.  In addition, if the account has
been suspended the reason will appear in the response (e.g.,
expired, over budget).  For LCIP accounts, the number of interactive
hours used and the number of hours allowed are shown (NOT including
time used in current session).  While the old syntax (SHOW CHARGES
FOR uuu$gg) will still be accepted, the recommended syntax is now:

         SHOW CHARGES [gg.uuu] [INTERNAL]

gg.uuu   an account.  If not specified, the logged-on account
         is assumed.

INTERNAL causes the fields to be displayed in a fixed format.  This
         is helpful when the response is being directed to the
         active file (i.e., DUMP CHARGES INTERNAL) for further
         processing.  The format is:

....v....1....v....2....v....3....v....4....v....5....v....6....v....7..
gguuuslaaaaaaaaa uuuuuuuuu bbbbbbbbb yyyyyyyyy mmmmmmmmm ppppppppp ddddd

    gguuu - account
    s - blank if account is active, "S" if account is suspended.
    l - blank if regular account, "L" if LCIP account.
    aaaaaaaaa - no. of interactive hours allowed (LCIP only)
    uuuuuuuuu - no. of interactive hours used (LCIP only)
    bbbbbbbbb - current budget ("-1" means no budget)
    yyyyyyyyy - current year-to-date charges
    mmmmmmmmm - current month-to-date charges
    ppppppppp - charges just added (yesterday's charges)
    ddddd     - date when charges were last calculated,
                  the format is: mm/dd
    Columns 72 and following are reserved for future use.


*10/24/79  (EFFECTIVE 11/02) SHOW AMESSAGE COMMAND ADDED

The SHOW AMESSAGE (or SHOW AMSG) command can be used to display any
accounting message which appears in the SHOW CHARGES command
response.


*10/24/79  (EFFECTIVE 11/02) NOATTN OPTION ADDED TO SET MODE

An ATTN/NOATTN option on the SET MODE command gives you control over
using BREAK/ATTN to enter collect mode.  If you SET MODE NOATTN, you
will have to type "COLLECT" (or "C") to enter collect mode.  This
option may be desirable if you find that you inadvertently enter
collect mode when pressing BREAK/ATTN to stop a command response (or
a list).  This can be annoying on "buffered" terminals such as the
GenCom.  Even in NOATTN mode it only takes two characters (C,
carriage-return) to enter collect mode.

The logon default is: SET MODE ATTN

To set NOATTN mode: SET MODE NOATTN

The "SHOW MODE" command will display the current mode settings.


*10/24/79  (EFFECTIVE 11/02) LOGOFF TIME, KEYWORD DATE AVAILABLE

A new command, SHOW LTIME, displays the time and date you last
logged off.  If the session ends with a system failure, then the
time will be when the system comes back up.  (The command, SET AUTO
LTIME, will display this automatically at each logon; see below for
details.) The command format is:

      SHOW LTIME [gg.uuu]

If an account other than the currently logged on user is specified
then a KEYWORD prompt will be given (and must be answered correctly)
before this information will be displayed.

A new command, SHOW KTIME, displays the time and date when an
account's keyword was last changed.  (SET AUTO KTIME can be used to
remind you at logon time when the keyword has not been changed in
over two weeks; see below for details.) The command format is:

     SHOW KTIME [gg.uuu]

If an account other than the currently logged on user is specified
then a KEYWORD prompt will be given (and must be answered correctly)
before this information will be displayed.

The SET AUTO command has been extended to allow display at logon of
logoff time (LTIME) and keyword change date (KTIME).  The information
is nearly the same as that displayed by the SHOW LTIME and SHOW KTIME
commands described above.

      SET AUTO [LTIME|NOLTIME] [KTIME|NOKTIME]

LTIME    causes the time of last logoff to be displayed at each
         logon (same information returned by the
         SHOW LTIME command, see details above)

NOLTIME  specifies that the last logoff time should not be displayed
         at each logon;  the default when a new account is created.

KTIME    causes the time of the last keyword change to be displayed
         at each logon if over two weeks have elapsed
         (see also the SHOW KTIME command described above)

NOKTIME  specifies that the last keyword change time should not be
         displayed at each logon; the default for new accounts.

In addition, the user can now set the name of a program which will
automatically be called at the start of a session (instead of
executing the Logon EXEC file).  To set an automatic program name:

         SET AUTO PROGRAM name
          or
         SET AUTO PROGRAM ORV.gg.uuu.PROGLIB#name

If just "name" is given then it is assumed that the program is a
PUBLIC program (e.g., SET AUTO PROGRAM APL).  If
"ORV.gg.uuu.PROGLIB#name" is given then the program must be located
in "ORV.gg.uuu.PROGLIB".


*10/24/79  (EFFECTIVE 11/02) SHOW NEWS COMMAND EXTENDED

The "NOVERIFY" option has been added to the SHOW NEWS command.
NOVERIFY will cause the items to be displayed without the "READ?"
prompt.  Also, "DUMP NEWS" now implies NOVERIFY mode.


*10/24/79  (EFFECTIVE 11/02) SHOW COLUMNS COMMAND EXTENDED

When the collect options (i.e., DUMP COLUMNS or SHOW COLUMNS
COLLECT) are used, "UNNUMBERED" is assumed and the columns will be
displayed up to the current line length (not the terminal width).


*10/08/79  HEADER PAGE OF OUTPUT NOW CONTAINS PRINT OPTIONS

The header page of output generated by the WYLBUR "PRINT" (or
"PUNCH") command now has the command with the options used on it.
Options taken from the "OPTIONS:" line are also displayed here.
The options are not abbreviated.


*09/06/79  HOW TO USE DEST=ENCINA, DEST=PINE, AND DEST=LOCAL

DEST=ENCINA and DEST=PINE will now print in the new Forsythe
Computing Center just as though DEST=LOCAL had been specified.
However, users are encouraged to use DEST=LOCAL in the future for
output in the Forsythe Computing Center.  In particular, users
should issue the command:

  SET  OUTPUT  DEST=LOCAL

at some time in WYLBUR if they wish to establish the Center as the
default destination for output.


*01/04/79  (EFFECTIVE 01/12) LINE LENGTH WARNING MESSAGE SUPPRESSED

The warning message: 'n CHARS IN LINE x' given when the line exceeds
the global length will be suppressed when the command is not typed
from the terminal.


*01/04/79  (EFFECTIVE 01/12) SHOW OPTIONS COMMAND EXTENDED

An account can now be specified on the SHOW OPTIONS command as

    SHOW OPTIONS gg.uuu

Only the permanent options can be displayed for another account.


*01/04/79  (EFFECTIVE 01/12) COLLECT COMMAND EXTENDED

WYLBUR will now re-number lines just collected if necessary (because
of an existing line) to continue collecting.  For example, if the
active file consists of:

        1.    ORIGINAL LINE ONE
        2.    ORIGINAL LINE TWO

and the user enters the command "COLLECT 1.8", the result will be:

        1.8  ? new line
        1.9  ? another new line
    RE-NUMBERED BY .02
        1.84 ? still another new line
        1.86 ? ***(attn)

The resulting active file will be:

        1.     ORIGINAL LINE ONE
        1.8    NEW LINE
        1.82   ANOTHER NEW LINE
        1.84   STILL ANOTHER NEW LINE
        2.     ORIGINAL LINE TWO

The re-numbering is not actually done until the next line is
entered.  Therefore, if the re-numbering is not wanted (or if the
user is finished collecting lines and the re-numbering is not
needed) a reply of BREAK/ATTN to the next line-number prompt will
cause WYLBUR to keep the original numbering.


*01/04/79  (EFFECTIVE 01/12) DATA SET FORMAT CHANGE PROMPT FIXED

WYLBUR will now automatically change the LRECL to be the same as the
block size when saving a member into a RECFM=U (edit format)
partitioned data set.


*01/04/79  (EFFECTIVE 01/12) SET/SHOW JOB COMMAND ADDED

New options to control job submission and authority for issuing HASP
commands have been added.  The SET JOB command allows the user to
change these permanent options (i.e., they will remain in effect
until the account is closed, or until another SET JOB command is
issued).

Change the "prefix" and "count" of WYLBUR generated jobnames by
using the "PREFIX" and "COUNT" options described below.  When an
account is first created, the prefix is set to "uuugg" (where "uuu"
is the user code and "gg" is the group code) and the count is set to
zero.

The syntax for SET JOB is:

    SET JOB [gg.uuu] [NUMBERED|UNNUMBERED] [FORCE|NOFORCE]
                     [PREFIX=prefix] [COUNT=n]
                     [AUTH={USER|GROUP|COMMUNITY|PUBLIC}]

gg.uuu   the account whose job options are to be updated.
         If omitted, the account of the signed on user is assumed.

NUMBERED columns 73/80 of the lines submitted by RUN
         and PUNCH can be replaced with the WYLBUR line-number if
         the columns are blank. (Comparable to current default.)

UNNUMBERED  columns 73/80 of the lines submitted by
         the RUN and PUNCH command are not to be changed by WYLBUR.

FORCE    the first three characters of all jobs
         submitted must be the user id from the account.  This
         option is comparable to the current default.

NOFORCE  WYLBUR will not change the jobname.

PREFIX=prefix  a new job prefix to be  part of the
         WYLBUR generated jobname.

COUNT=n  a new job count from which the WYLBUR
         generated jobname will be incremented

AUTH={USER|GROUP|COMMUNITY|PUBLIC}
         the group of users which, when the correct  keyword
         is supplied are allowed to RUN, ALTER, PURGE, FETCH,
         CANCEL, HOLD, and RELEASE jobs belonging to the account
         specified.

The initial values when an account is created are:

         UNNUMBERED, NOFORCE, PREFIX=uuugg, COUNT=n, AUTH=COMMUNITY

Currently existing accounts will have "NUMBERED" and "FORCE" as an
initial value to provide compatibility with previous versions of
WYLBUR.


The syntax for the SHOW JOB command is:

    SHOW JOB [gg.uuu]

gg.uuu   the account whose job options are to be displayed.
         If omitted, the signed on user's account is assumed.

Job options are also displayed by the SHOW OPTIONS command.


*01/04/79  (EFFECTIVE 01/12) SET/SHOW JES COMMAND EXTENDED

The SET JES command provides the following functions:

   .  sets TERSE or VERBOSE style HASP messages

   .  makes output and/or execution hold default on the RUN command

   .  temporarily blocks job submission (this provides a convenient
      way of forcing EXEC files which automatically submit jobs
      to get an "EXEC BREAK")

   .  allows the user to set session overrides for the permanent
      "JOB" and "OUTPUT" options, namely:

         NUMBERED|UNNUMBERED     FORCE|NOFORCE
         PREFIX      COUNT
         DEST     BIN
         FORMS

The syntax for the SET JES command is:

    SET JES [TERSE|VERBOSE] [HOLD|NOHOLD] [XHOLD|NOXHOLD]
            [RUN|NORUN] [NUMBERED|UNNUMBERED] [PREFIX=prefix]
            [COUNT=n] [DEST=dest] [BIN=bin] [FORMS=forms]

TERSE    TERSE style HASP messages are wanted.

VERBOSE  VERBOSE style HASP messages are wanted.

HOLD     output hold is to be assumed for the RUN command.

NOHOLD   output hold is not to be assumed for the RUN command.

XHOLD    execution hold is to be assumed for the RUN command.

NOXHOLD  execution hold is not to be assumed for the RUN command.

RUN      job submission is to be allowed.

NORUN    job submission is not to be allowed.

NUMBERED numbered job submission is to be used, even
         if the user's job options specify unnumbered.

UNNUMBERED  unnumbered job submission is to be used,
         even if the user's job options specify numbered.

PREFIX=prefix  a job prefix used when generating a WYLBUR jobname.

COUNT=n  starting job count used when generating a WYLBUR jobname.

DEST=dest  an output destination.

BIN=bin  an output bin.

FORMS=forms  output forms.

The command "SET JES" (with no options) will set the jes options
back to their signon values.

For compatibility with previous versions of WYLBUR these forms
of the SET JES command will still be accepted:

     SET JES JOBNAME ANY
     SET JES JOBNAME
     SET JES SUBMIT NUMBERED    (equivalent to "SET JES NUMBERED")
     SET JES SUBMIT UNNUMBERED  (equivalent to "SET JES UNNUMBERED")
     SET JES SUBMIT CHECK
     SET JES SUBMIT NOCHECK


*01/04/79  (EFFECTIVE 01/12) RUN COMMAND EXTENDED

To alleviate confusion between the default of numbered on the RUN
command and explicitly using the "NUMBERED" option there are now two
words for the two different options.  The options are:

NUMBERED   WYLBUR line-numbers are to be
           placed in columns 73/80 of the lines when they are
           submitted, if those columns are blank.

RNUMBERED  WYLBUR line-numbers are always
           to be placed in columns 73/80 of the lines when
           they are submitted, even if it means replacing
           text originally in those columns.

WYLBUR will now convert JCL statements to uppercase when they are
submitted, with the exception of comment cards and text inside
single quotes.  This avoids problems when users have inadvertently
entered JCL statements in lower case.


Two new forms of the WYLBUR job statement are allowed, they are:

    //&text  JOB  [... other job information ...]

         where "&" gets changed to the user id of the submission
         account.

    //+text  JOB  [... other job information ...]

         where "+" gets changed to the job prefix of the submission
         account.  (The prefix will be shortened, if necessary to
         make room for the text.)


If the account on the JOB statement is not the signed-on user's,
WYLBUR will, if the job authority permits it (see "AUTH" option on
the "SET JOB" command) prompt the user for the keyword.


New options on the RUN command are:

JOBNAME=jobname  the jobname to be used.

PREFIX=prefix  the job prefix to be used.

HOLD     the job is to be placed into output hold
         ("HOLD=OUTPUT" is also accepted for compatibility)

XHOLD    the job is to be placed into execution hold
         ("HOLD=JOB" is also accepted for compatibility)

FROM=dsname  an external data set to be submitted (instead
         of the active or EXEC file).  Note: Due to internal
         restrictions, WYLBUR can not prompt for KEYWORD on a "RUN
         FROM" (the user will get a "REQUEST ABORTED" message if the
        account on the JOB statement requires keyword verification.)

PRIORITY=p  or  PRIORITY=(p,p)
         execution or execution,output priority.  (See
         the HASP Reference Card for information on priorities.)

BLOCK=b  or  BLOCK=(b,b)
         execution or execution,output time block.
         (See the HASP Reference Card for information on time
         blocks.)

CHARS=a  or CHARS=(a,b,c,d)
         one or multiple character sets.  Note that
         multiple character sets will only be used if the job uses
         OPTCD=J for its sysout.  (See the 3800 Manual for
         information on using multiple character sets.)

FLASH=f  a forms flash overlay.  (See the 3800 Manual
         for information on forms flashes.)


*01/04/79  (EFFECTIVE 01/12) PRINT AND PUNCH COMMANDS EXTENDED

The PRINT and PUNCH commands have been redone to allow many new
options.  These commands no longer submit a job for execution.
Instead, WYLBUR takes advantage of some new capabilities in HASP and
now puts the job directly in the output queue.

PRINT will now print lines which are longer than 133 characters.
This allows users to take better advantage of the 3800's longer
print width.

The PRINT and PUNCH commands will now look at the first line in the
range.  If it begins with "OPTIONS:", then the remaining text in the
line can specify print options.  This provides a convenient way of
keeping the print options for a file with that file.  The options
line itself does not get printed.  For example, a sample options
line might be:

        1.    OPTIONS: CHARS=TN12 INDENT=24 TITLE='CHART' ; comments

New options on the PRINT and PUNCH commands are:

FROM=dsname  an external data set to be printed (instead of
         the active or EXEC file).

DOCUMENT short form for "NONUMBER,UPLOW,FORMS=9511".

PRIORITY=p  an output priority.  (See the HASP Reference
         Card for information about priorities.)

BLOCK=b  an output time block.  (See the HASP Reference Card for
         information on time blocks.)

CHARS=a  or  CHARS=(a,b,c,d)
         one or multiple character sets.  If the character
         sets are specified in parentheses, then the first character
         (if CC/MC is not specified) or the second character (if
         CC/MC is specified) of each line is assumed to be the
         character set number.  (See the 3800 Manual for information
         about using multiple character sets.)

FLASH=f  a forms flash overlay.  (See the 3800 Manual
         for information on forms flashes.)



*01/04/79  (EFFECTIVE 01/12) CONDENSE COMMAND CHANGES

Two minor changes have been made to the CONDENSE command, they are:

    .  the generated jobname will be "uuuCOND" to make it easier
       to recognize the job as a CONDENSE job.

    .  if the CONDENSE fails, the job will now be placed in output
       hold, unless the user uses the NOHOLD option.


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) PRINT COMMAND RATHER THAN LIST OFFLINE

To encourage the use of the PRINT command and consistent syntax for
its options, some new warning messages will appear:

"LIST OFFLINE" will now give the warning message:
   USE "PRINT" COMMAND INSTEAD.  "OFFLINE" OPTION WILL BE REMOVED

specifying just a title string on the PRINT command will generate
the warning message:
   USE "TITLE='title'" OPTION INSTEAD OF JUST SPECIFYING 'title'

specifying "(n)" on the PRINT command (for indentation) will
generate the warning message:
   USE "INDENT=n" OPTION INSTEAD OF SPECIFYING "(n)"

The options will currently only generate warning messages if the
command is typed from the terminal.  However, starting December 1st,
the warning messages will also be given when the command comes from
an EXEC file.


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) SHOW OPTIONS COMMAND

The "SHOW OPTIONS" command has been added to display all of the
WYLBUR options, namely:

    . terse/verbose, fast/slow, upper/uplow, back/noback,
         break/nobreak, comm/nocomm, timeout/notime
    . delta, length
    . name, library, volume
    . escape, skip, rescan
    . modes
    . exec options
    . jes options
    . auto options
    . output options


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) SET MODE COMMAND CHANGES

Two options have been added to the SET MODE command, they are
"LIST|NOLIST" and "CLEAR|NOCLEAR".

LIST mode makes "list" the default on the following editing
commands, if they are typed from the terminal:

INSERT   COLLECT   REPLACE   JOIN   DELETE   EXCHANGE

CLEAR mode specifies that it is ok to clear the active file without
prompting the user if no changes have been made.

The signon values are NOLIST and NOCLEAR.


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) LENGTH OPTIONS ON EDITING COMMANDS

The line length can now be overridden temporarily on editing
commands.  (For example, to avoid being warned of excess length.)
The length options are:

   LENGTH=n|NOLENGTH

and they are valid on the following commands:

CHANGE   INSERT   MODIFY   COLLECT   REPLACE   EDIT

For example, the command:

    CHANGE 'FROG' TO 'PRINCE' NOLENGTH NOLIST

will not generate any messages (unless truncation occurs).

Note that "NOL" is an abbreviation for NOLIST, not NOLENGTH.  An
acceptable abbreviation for the NOLENGTH option is "NOLEN".


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) ABBREVIATE EDITING COMMANDS TO ONE LETTER

The following commands can be abbreviated to their first character:

INSERT   MODIFY   REPLACE   EDIT   DELETE   JOIN


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) "Y" NOW ACCEPTED AS YES RESPONSE

"Y" is now an acceptable affirmative response for questions WYLBUR
asks which require a YES/NO answer (e.g., OK TO CLEAR?).


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) CHARACTERS IN HEX FORMAT NOW EASIER

An easier mechanism now exists for listing the hexadecimal
representation of text.  You can use the hexadecimal representation
when specifying an associative range by specifying:

    X'hexadecimal string'

For example:

    LIST X'27'   -or-  MODIFY X'27' AND ~X'FF'

The user can now specify strings in hexadecimal on the CHANGE
command, for example:

    CHANGE X'32' TO X'1C0E'

In addition, the "HEX" option has been added to the LIST command to
allow listing lines in their hexadecimal representation.


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) INSERT COMMAND EXTENDED

There is no limit on the number of line-numbers which can be
specified on the INSERT command (previously, the maximum was 25
line-numbers).  In addition, the user can now specify the number of
lines to insert starting at a line-number, using the notation:

     n(m)

where "n" is the line-number to start at and "m" is the number of
lines to insert.  WYLBUR will automatically pick an optimal delta to
accommodate the lines.

For example:

   INSERT 1, 5.1(3)    -or-     INSERT 9.01(50) DITTO


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) DELETE AND MOVE COMMAND SYNTAX RELAXED

The DELETE and MOVE commands now only require a range (either
explicit or associative) to be specified.  For example, the command:

    DELETE 'BOO'

is now valid, where previously the user had to also supply an
explicit range ("in all" for example).


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) VERIFY OPTION ADDED TO THE DELETE COMMAND

When the new VERIFY option is used on the DELETE command, each line
is listed and the user is asked if it is ok to delete that line.  An
affirmative reply will cause the line to be deleted.  A reply of
attention (only) will abort the command.  A reply of "MODIFY" or
"EDIT" allows the user to MODIFY or EDIT that line, instead of
deleting it.  Any other response, will cause the line to be kept and
the command will continue.


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) CHANGE COMMAND ALLOWS CHANGING CASE

The CHANGE command has been extended to allow a mechanism for
changing the case of alphabetic text.  The syntax for the new
options are:

    CHANGE {op1|ALL} TO {UPPER|LOWER}

op1      any valid first operand of the CHANGE command.
         (Column ranges, associative character strings.)

ALL     all columns are to be changed

UPPER   the text is to be changed to upper case.

LOWER   the text is to be changed to lower case.


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) MODIFY/EDIT EXTENSIONS

The following line-oriented functions may now be abbreviated to one
character (not including the '.'):

    .REPLACE
    .DELETE
    .JOIN

Two new line-oriented functions have been added:

.INSERT  causes a prompt for a new line after the line being
(or .I)  modified.  Inserting a new line implies the acceptance
         of the modifications to the current line.

.COLLECT causes a prompt for new lines after the line being
(or .C)  modified.  Collecting new lines implies the acceptance of
         the modifications to the current line.


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) COLLECT COMMAND EXTENDED

Several extensions have been made to the COLLECT command.  The
collect line-number, case, and length overrides are now saved when a
typed collect command is issued.  (Previously, only the line-number
and list options were saved.  Also, the options are only saved when
the collect command is typed from the terminal.  This allows EXEC
files to collect information from the user without disturbing the
saved collect options.) If no line-number is specified on the
collect command it is assumed to be a resumption of the previous
collect, and the saved collect options are then used.

The collect command will now remember if the user is collecting at
the end of the file.  Then, if another command adds lines to the end
of the file and the user resumes collecting (either by hitting
<attn> or by typing just "COLLECT"), WYLBUR will start prompting at
the new end of the file.  For example:

    ? collect
        1.   ? data
        2.   ? ***(attn)
    ? copy from mydata
    18. - LAST LINE
    ? collect
       19.   ?

will now occur, where previously the user would receive the message:

    LINE 2. ALREADY EXISTS. COLLECT ABORTED

The "COLLECT CLEAR" command will not actually clear the active file
until the first line has been entered.  For example:

    ? collect clear
        1.   ? ***(attn)
    ACTIVE NOT CLEARED
    ?


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) COMPARE COMMAND EXTENDED

The COMPARE command now accepts the "COLUMNS" option to restrict the
comparison to the columns specified.  For example:

    COMPARE 1,5000 COLUMNS 1/65


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) JOIN COMMAND ADDED

A new JOIN command has been added.  The JOIN command joins two or
more lines and replaces the first line specified with the result.
The "joined" lines will be deleted, unless the "NODELETE" option is
used.  The default is to have one blank separating the lines,
however, you can specify separator characters by using the SEPARATOR
option.  The syntax for the JOIN command is:

    JOIN range [SEPARATOR='string'|NOSEPARATOR] [NODELETE]
               [VERIFY] [length-options] [list-options]

SEPARATOR='string'   the characters which are to be placed
         between the joined lines.

NOSEPARATOR no characters are to be placed between
         the joined lines.

NODELETE the lines which have been joined to the
         first line are not to be deleted.

VERIFY   the joined line is to be listed and the user
         asked if it is ok before the change is actually made.
         In addition, the user can reply "MODIFY" or "EDIT" to make
         modifications to the joined line.

length-options      provides an override of the
                    global line warning length.

list-options      standard list options.



*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) EXCHANGE COMMAND

A new EXCHANGE command has been added.  The EXCHANGE command
switches the text in two lines.  The syntax is:

    EXCHANGE lineno1 lineno2 [VERIFY] [list-options]

lineno1, lineno2     the lines in the active file for which
                     text is to be switched

VERIFY the exchanged lines are to be listed and the
      user asked if it is ok before change is actually made.

list-options     standard list options


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) SEVERAL PROMPTS HAVE CHANGED

Prompts which require a YES or OK response, such as:

    OK TO CLEAR?
    REPLACE?
    CONDENSE?

are now all prefixed by the words "OK TO" if the user is in verbose
mode.  If the user is in terse mode, the "OK TO" part of the prompt
is suppressed.

When prompting to clear the active file, WYLBUR will display the
number of changes to the active file (if there are any), even if the
number does not exceed the warn count.  In verbose, the prompt is:

    n TYPED CHANGES TO YOUR ACTIVE FILE
    OK TO CLEAR?

In terse, it is shortened to:

    n CHANGES, CLEAR?

When prompting to replace a data set or member which already exists,
the verbose prompt:

   dataset ALREADY ON volume  -or-  MEMBER member ALREADY IN dataset
   OK TO REPLACE?                   OK TO REPLACE?

is shortened to the terse version:

    REPLACE dataset ON volume?   -or-  REPLACE member IN dataset?


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) WRITE COMMAND ADDED

A new WRITE command has been added.  The WRITE command displays an
expression at the terminal, it is primarily useful in EXEC files.
The syntax is:

    WRITE expr [ATTN line-number] [NONL]

expr     an expression (e.g., 'STRING', S0, or N1||'='||S2)

ATTN line-number      a line-number to go to in the EXEC file
         if the attention key is used to interrupt the write.  As a
         safeguard against having an un-interruptible EXEC file, the
         attention line-number will not be honored if the attention
         key has already been used once.  Reading from the terminal
         clears the "attention key used one" indicator.

NONL     the line is to be written without a carriage
         return at the end.


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) SHOW COLUMNS COMMAND EXTENDED

The SHOW COLUMNS command has been revised and extended.  The format
of the response will now be:

    ....v....1....v....2....v....3...

where the "v" marks the fives place (5, 15, 25, etc.) and the digit
is the tens place.  (This change was originally made at SCIP's SLAC
Facility).  In addition, some new options have been added.  The
syntax for the SHOW COLUMNS command is:

    SHOW COLUMNS [n] [UNNUMBERED]

n     the number of columns to display.  The default is
      to display up to the terminal width.

UNNUMBERED specifies that the columns are to start at absolute
      column 1.  If this option is not specified, the columns are
      indented eleven spaces (which is the number of spaces
      required to display a line-number).


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) SET/SHOW TABS COMMAND EXTENDED

The SET and SHOW TABS commands have been extended to allow setting
tabs before absolute column 12.  Also, new options now provide
automatic tab setting capabilities for some terminals.

The syntax for the SET TABS command is:

    SET TABS [t1,t2,...,t16] [UNNUMBERED] [NOVERIFY]
             [GENCOM] [AUTO]

t1,t2,...,t16     up to 16 tabs, in ascending order.

UNNUMBERED specifies that the tabs are relative to absolute
           column 1.

NOVERIFY suppresses the tab verification lines

GENCOM causes the appropriate control characters to be sent to set
       tabs for a Gen-Com type terminal.

AUTO causes a clear tabs sequence to be typed.  Then an
     "ESCAPE,1" to be typed at every position where there is a
     tab stop.  This sets tabs on many types of terminals.

To reset the current tab settings, use either

SET TABS GENCOM   -   or   -   SET TABS AUTO

The syntax for the SHOW TABS command is:

    SHOW TABS [NUMBERED|UNNUMBERED] [VERIFY]


NUMBERED causes the tabs to be displayed relative to absolute
         column 12.

UNNUMBERED causes the tabs to be displayed relative to absolute
           column 1.

VERIFY causes the tab verification lines to be written


*10/30/78  (EFFECTIVE 11/03) CHANGES IN PREPARATION FOR LONGER LINES

WYLBUR will now allow lines of up to 235 characters in length to be
collected and saved (the previous limit was 133 characters).  However,
there are temporarily a number of restrictions which pertain to the
longer line length:

    1.  Lines greater than 156 characters will get truncated when
        listed at the terminal.

    2.  Output from the PRINT command will be truncated to 133
        characters.

    3.  ORVYL and MILTEN commands will be truncated to 133
        characters.

These restrictions are temporary.  They are present to allow us time
to change the components of the system separately.


*09/12/78  TAPE INFO COMMANDS ADDED TO WYLBUR

New commands have been added to WYLBUR which allow users to display
and update tape information kept in the TLMS (Tape Library
Management System) database.  The SET and SHOW TAPE commands are
explained in detail below.

The SHOW TAPE command will display the following information about a
tape:

     . the tape owner
     . the first data set name
     . the output use code
     . the keep date
     . the job name
     . the programmer name
     . the number of files on the tape
     . the creation and last accessed dates

This information can only be displayed by users with the same group
code as the tape owner/renter or the same group code that is
imbedded in the first data set name.

As with other WYLBUR SHOW commands, the "DUMP TAPE" command can be
used to put this information in the active file.

The "SHOW TAPE" command has the syntax:

     SHOW TAPE volser [ALL]

where:

volser   specifies the tape volume serial

ALL      specifies that information such as the start I/O and error
         counts are to be displayed in addition to the standard
         information.

The SET TAPE command allows the user to update fields in the tape
entry.  Only the tape owner/renter can use the command.

The SET TAPE command has the following syntax:

     SET TAPE volser [DSNAME=dsname] [USECODE=n] [KEEP=mm/dd/yy]
                     [JOBNAME=jobname] [NAME=name] [FILES=n]
                     [RELEASE] [RESERVE]

volser   specifies the tape volume serial

DSNAME=dsname
         specifies the new data set name.  The data set name is
         originally the name of the first data set on the tape.

USECODE=n
         specifies a tape output usage code, the valid values are:
              1 - Write access not allowed
              2 - Only tape owner can write on tape
              3 - Only tape owner's group can write on tape
              4 - Any user can write on tape, provided that the
                    keep date has passed.
              5 - Any user can write on the tape

KEEP=mm/dd/yy
         specifies the "keep" date for the tape


JOBNAME=jobname
         specifies the new jobname.  The jobname is originally the
         name of the job which has written on the tape.

NAME=name  or  NAME='name'
         specifies the new programmer name.  This is originally the
         first 10 characters of the programmer name field on the
         jobcard of the job which has written on the tape.

FILES=n  specifies the number of files on the tape (from 1 to 999).

RELEASE  specifies that the tape is to be released to the scratch
         pool.

RESERVE  specifies that the tape is to be reserved (i.e., removed
         from the scratch pool).  This is only permitted if the user
         was the previous owner of the tape.  This option allows a
         user to retain a tape which has been inadvertently released
         to the scratch pool.

QUIET    Standard WYLBUR Option.  It suppressed the response if the
         command is successful.


*08/02/78  MAKING RUN HOLD THE DEFAULT

The command "SET JES HOLD" will make the default output hold for
RUN commands for the duration of that session.  The "SET JES HOLD"
command will no longer cause PRINT, PUNCH, and SUGGEST jobs to be
placed in output hold.  The command "SET JES NOHOLD" will turn off
the output hold default.  The command "RUN NOHOLD" can be used to
override the global output hold default.


*07/10/78  CARRIAGE CONTROL FOR TERMINAL LISTINGS

WYLBUR can now list files on a hard-copy terminal (GenCom or
Trendata) with carriage control functions.  The commands:
     LIST CC    (for ASA carriage control)
     LIST ASA   (for ASA carriage control)
     LIST MC    (for machine control)
will result in the appropriate forms feed or line spacing.


*06/15/78  WYLBUR SHOW SPACE COMMAND CORRECTED

The SHOW SPACE command now accurately displays the number of free
extents on a volume (even if it exceeds 255).  Also, the command
has been extended to display the largest free extent.

*05/03/78  WYLBUR SHOW NEWS RESULTS DIFFERENT

Effective May 5, news items displayed with the SHOW NEWS ALL command
will be displayed in the order of newest items first (the same order
in which they appear in the NEWS PUBLIC file).  Automatic news, or
just the SHOW NEWS command, displays items oldest first, because
only unread items are considered.  That allows you to "catch up" on
the news and also allows WYLBUR to keep track by its date flag of
which items have been acknowledged.


*03/22/78  (EFFECTIVE 03/24) AUTOMATIC WYLBUR NEWS

Effective March 24, the automatic NEWS reading facility will become
the defaut for all users.  That means that you will be getting the
prompts asking you if you want to read recent items from the file
NEWS PUBLIC.  Details of this facility are in the earlier item.


*02/21/78  (REVISED) ACTIVE FILE RECOVERY CAN BE AUTOMATIC

When you sign on after an active file has been saved from a previous
session, WYLBUR will now automatically USE the data set ACTIVE  and
give you the message "ACTIVE FILE RECOVERED".  You may then SAVE the
data with a unique name of your own or simply CLEAR ACTIVE and
SCRATCH ACTIVE ON CAT if you don't need a copy of it.

Note that now only one ACTIVE file will exist at any time for an
account since WYLBUR recovery always replaces the cataloged ACTIVE
file.

To disable the automatic recovery (i.e., to go back to the way
recovery worked before) you may issue the new command SET AUTO
NORECOVERY.  The active file will then not be used when you log on;
you will simply get the message that an active file was recovered
from your last session.  The automatic recovery USE feature is the
default and is enabled with the command SET AUTO RECOVERY.

Note also that your LOGON EXEC file can determine if an active file
was saved from a previous session.  See "LOGON EXEC PARMS" in an
item below.


*02/21/78  (REVISED) LOGON/LOGOFF COMMAND CHANGES

The LOGON and LOGOFF commands now have a "SAVE" option which
specifies that the ACTIVE file is to be saved.  If SAVE and CLEAR
are both specified, CLEAR is ignored.  The syntax for the commands
is now:
      LOGON  [CLEAR [WARN|NOWARN]|SAVE]
      LOGOFF [CLEAR [WARN|NOWARN]|SAVE]
If there is an ACTIVE file and neither CLEAR nor SAVE is specified,
WYLBUR will ask the user if it is "OK TO CLEAR" the active file.  A
reply of "YES", "OK", or "CLEAR" will CLEAR the active file.  A
reply of <attn> will abort the LOGOFF sequence.  Any other reply
(including NO) will cause the active file to be saved and the logoff
will continue.


*02/21/78  (REVISED) AUTOMATIC NEWS READING FACILITY

WYLBUR can display items contained in the data set NEWS PUBLIC.  The
system remembers which items the user has already read, and will
only display new ones.  This capability provides an easy way for
users to stay informed of system changes without having to remember
to USE NEWS PUBLIC.  If you want to be informed of new items when
you logon, issue the command SET AUTO NEWS.  The default will
initially be SET AUTO NONEWS but will be changed to provide
automatic NEWS in the future.  Note also that your Logon EXEC file
will now be able to determine if there is new news, see "LOGON EXEC
FILE PARMS" section below.

The news items are displayed in the following format:

      mm/dd/yy title; n LINES, READ?

the "mm/dd/yy" is the date of the news item, the "title" is the
general description of the item, and "n LINES" is the number of
lines of text the description contains.  A reply of "YES", "OK", or
"READ" to the "READ?" prompt will mark the item as read and display
the text.  A reply of <attn> will abort the process without marking
that news item as read.  Any other response will mark the item as
read but not display the text to the user. For example, if the item
did not concern you, you could say NO and you would see a READ?
prompt for the next item.  Any items you read or reject (with a NO)
will be marked as having been read by you so the system will not
remind you about them next time you logon.

You can  also request  a display of NEWS items anytime by issuing
the "SHOW NEWS" command.  The syntax of the command is as follows:

      SHOW NEWS [ALL] [SUMMARY]

The default is to prompt (as above) with READ? for all items that
have not been read.  ALL means prompt for all items in NEWS.
SUMMARY means display dates and titles only but don't prompt for
READ.  Items displayed with the SUMMARY option are marked as read.


*02/15/78  (EFFECTIVE 02/17) SET EXEC COMMAND CHANGES

The AUTO/NOAUTO option has been removed from the "SET EXEC" command.
WYLBUR will now look for a member LOGON in the user's library and
execute it if it exists.  New users need only save a member in their
library called "LOGON" to take advantage of this facility.  The user
can tell WYLBUR not to execute member LOGON even if it exists by
issuing the command "SET AUTO NOEXEC" (described below under the
"NEW SET AUTO COMMAND" section).

The initial signon defaults on the SET EXEC command have been
changed from "VERBOSE LOG" to "NOLOG TERSE".  This change is made
with the realization that "NOLOG TERSE" is the setting that most
users want when using EXEC files and that LOG and VERBOSE are used
primarily for EXEC file debugging.


*02/15/78  (EFFECTIVE 02/17) MODIFY/EDIT COMMAND ADDITIONS

Refer to the older items dated 11/23/77 and 11/12/77  for details
about MODIFY and EDIT command extensions.


"*+n" and "*-n" are allowed as "length specifications" for modify
characters.  For example, "*-1B" will blank out the rest of the
line except for the last character.

If "M" (for MODIFY) is typed as the first character in response
to the "EDITS?" prompt, then the remainder of the line is treated
as modify characters.

New line oriented functions added are:
      .PREVIOUS  - accept modifications to the current line and
                   start modifying the previous line.
      .NEXT      - accept modifications to the current line and
                   start modifying the next line.
      .LINE line - accept modifications to the current line and
                   start modifying the line indicated.


*02/15/78  (EFFECTIVE 02/17) NEW SET AUTO COMMAND

A new "SET AUTO" command has been added to give the user control
over the functions which will automatically occur at signon time.
The "SET AUTO" options remain in effect until the account is closed.
The syntax of the command is as follows:

      SET AUTO [NEWS|NONEWS]  [RECOVERY|NORECOVERY] [EXEC|NOEXEC]

where:

NEWS     specifies that new items (contained in the data set
         NEWS PUBLIC) are to be displayed to the user at signon
         time. See the item above "AUTOMATIC NEWS READING".

NONEWS   specifies that news is not to be displayed at signon time.
         Note the "SHOW NEWS" command can be used to display new
         items. NONEWS is currently the default.


RECOVERY specifies that if an ACTIVE file had to be saved when the
         previous session ended, it is to be automatically USEd and
         an ACTIVE FILE RECOVERED MESSAGE given at the next log on.

NORECOVERY  specifies that an ACTIVE file saved when the previous
         session ended is not to be automatically used at
         the start of the next session.  It is up to the user (or
         the user's Logon EXEC file) to use the ACTIVE data set and
         SCRATCH it if it is not wanted.  Note that your Logon EXEC
         file can now determine if an ACTIVE file was saved, see
         "LOGON EXEC FILE PARMS" section below.

EXEC     specifies that if a member LOGON exists in the user's
         library, it is to be automatically executed.  This is the
         default when an account is created.

NOEXEC   specifies that no automatic Logon EXEC file is to be
         executed, even if the user has a member LOGON in his
         library.


The command "SHOW AUTO" will display the auto options in effect.


*02/15/78  (EFFECTIVE 02/17) LOGON EXEC FILE PARMS

The PARM variable provides a mechanism for WYLBUR to give the LOGON
EXEC file information.  PARM will have one of the following values
on entry to the user's Logon EXEC file:

  a. '' (null)

  b. 'NEWS' -- there is unread NEWS waiting (this value will only
        occur if the user has disabled automatic news).

  c. 'RECOVERY' -- there is an "ACTIVE" data set saved by recovery
        from the previous session (this value will only occur if the
        user has disabled automatic recovery).

  d. combination of b and c (e.g., 'NEWS,RECOVERY')

The PARM settings allow your Logon EXEC file to do its own
processing of NEWS and/or RECOVERY if the standard default is not
wanted.  For example (assume the user issued a "SET AUTO NORECOVERY"
in the previous session):

  IF (INDEX(PARM,'RECOVERY') NE 0) COMMENT ACTIVE SAVED LAST SESSION

*01/05/78  MESSAGE FOR SMALL DATASETS SUPPRESSED IN TERSE MODE

When a data set is saved that takes less than one track, WYLBUR
informs the user that saving the data set as a member of a library
may be more efficient use of disk space.  We feel that most
experienced users are aware of this, so the message:
     SAVE SMALL DATASETS IN A LIBRARY
will now only be given when the user is in verbose mode.


*01/05/78  AUTOMATIC RETRY SUPPRESSED FOR CERTAIN ERRORS

Automatic retry is now suppressed for errors like "NO ACTIVE FILE"
or "NO EXEC FILE" since it is unlikely that any editing of the
command is wanted.  (A response of carriage-return will still invoke
retry for the command).


*01/05/78  REPLACE COMMAND "BUG" FIXED

A response of carriage-return (only) to a replace line-number prompt
used to leave the old line unchanged instead of replacing the line
with a blank line as many people expected.  This subtle feature of
the REPLACE command (which is actually documented in the WYLBUR
Manual) has caused numerous complaints in the past and has now been
removed.  A carriage-return response will now replace the old line
with a blank line.


*01/05/78  QUIET OPTION ADDED TO MANY COMMANDS

The "QUIET" option is now available on commands that reply with an
affirmative response.  Specifying QUIET requests that all responses
be suppressed if the command is successful.  For example, the
command:
    SAVE DATA ON SCR002 QUIET
will produce no messages if the SAVE is successful.

The following commands accept the QUIET option:
     CATALOG       PRINT           RUN
     UNCATALOG     SUGGEST         HOLD
     RECATALOG     PUNCH           RELEASE
     SAVE          PURGE
     SCRATCH       CANCEL


*01/05/78  NEW ATTN OPTION ON READ COMMAND

There is a new "ATTN=<line-number>" option on the READ command for
EXEC files.  The line-number is the line-number to go to if just
attention (break) is entered in response to the prompt.  When the
ATTN option is not used, this condition causes an EXEC BREAK.  The
variable(s) listed for READ VALUE or READ STRING remain unchanged
when the "attn" condition occurs (regardless of whether or not an
ATTN line-number is specified).  Symbolic line-numbers are
acceptable.  For example, "ATTN=*" will cause the READ command to be
re-executed if (just) attention is entered.  Another example is:

     SET VALUE S9 'default'
     READ STRING S9 PROMPT 'ITEM? ' ATTN NEXT
     ; S9 will either be what the user entered or "default" if
     ; the user entered just attention.

A response of "?<attn>" to the prompt will force an EXEC BREAK (even
if an ATTN line-number is specified).


*01/05/78  (EFFECTIVE 01/21) DEFAULT MODE CHANGED FROM NOWARN TO WARN=30

The default "WARN" number will be 30.  This means that an attempt to
CLEAR your active file after 30 or more changes have been made
(without it being SAVEd) will produce a verification prompt:

     nn TYPED CHANGES TO YOUR ACTIVE FILE
     OK TO CLEAR?

This feature has been available since August (see "*08/01/77 WARN
Option Added To SET MODE Command" for more information).  The
feature can be disabled with the command:

     SET MODE NOWARN

or the WARN threshold number can be changed with the command:

     SET MODE WARN=nn


*01/05/78  (EFFECTIVE 01/21) DEFAULT MODE CHANGED FROM SHORT TO NOSHORT

The short forms of INSERT/REPLACE/DELETE (just specifying the
line-number followed by text) can be the source of inadvertent
changes to the active file.  For example, a user types "LOC 12" but
the "LOC" gets lost and the remainder of the command "12" causes
line 12 to be deleted.  In "NOSHORT" mode, the user is prompted:

     INSERT|REPLACE|DELETE line-number?

for verification.  A reply of "YES" or "OK" will perform the
operation.  The user can also reply "YES,LIST".  Note that the
prompt will only be given for implied editing commands typed at the
terminal (i.e., the user will not get the prompt if the command
comes from an EXEC file).  See "*08/01/77 NOVICE MODE..." for more
information.  This feature can be disabled with the command:

     SET MODE SHORT


*01/05/78  (EFFECTIVE 01/21) EXEC PAUSE WILL NO LONGER GENERATE A MESSAGE

When an "EXEC PAUSE" command is executed from an EXEC file, the user
would always get the message:

    -> EXEC PAUSE

even if the exec mode was NOLOG and TERSE.  This message will now be
suppressed in NOLOG, TERSE mode.  This gives the EXEC file program
more control over the output produced at the terminal.  It is also
consistent with the logging of other commands at the terminal.  If
the user wants to write a message to the terminal before returning
control to WYLBUR, a sequence like:

    COMMENT EXEC PAUSE
    EXEC PAUSE

should be used.


*11/23/77  FURTHER EXTENSIONS TO MODIFY/EDIT COMMANDS

Modify mode now has an "E" (edits) character.  Typing "E" will treat
the rest of the line as an edits response.  The "E" character has an
optional length specification.


*11/23/77  DEFINE COMMAND EXTENSIONS

Some minor additions have been made to the define command syntax.  A
new "SYSTEM" option has been added which suppresses the "REPLACES
SYSTEM COMMAND" message.  Also, the text following the word "AS" or
"APPEND" does not need to be quoted.  For example,

         DEFINE CU AS USE APPEND CLEAR
is equivalent to...
         DEFINE CU AS 'USE ' APPEND ' CLEAR'


*11/23/77  COMMAND RETRY WILL BE RELIABLE

Previously, some WYLBUR commands could not be retried because the
"saved copy" of the command was not available.  Command retry will
now always work.


*11/23/77  LIST OPTIONS ADDED TO ALIGN, JUSTIFY, AND CENTER

The "list options" have been added to the ALIGN, JUSTIFY and CENTER
commands.  The default is NOLIST, which previously was the only mode
available.



*11/12/77  PARM OPTION ADDED TO EXEC COMMAND

A new PARM='text'|"text"|(text) option on the EXEC command sets
the new preprocessor variable "PARM".  For example, the command:

         EXEC FROM #FIND PARM='SAMPLE'

will set the PARM variable to  "sample".   If  PARM  is  omitted  on
either  EXEC  FROM  or EXEC ACTIVE the PARM variable is set to null.
On all other types of  EXEC  commands  the  value  of  PARM  remains
unchanged  unless  a  PARM  is  explicitly stated.  For example, the
command:  EXEC FROM #TEST will reset PARM to null, but EXEC 13  will
leave  PARM  unchanged.  A NOPARM option can be used on EXEC FROM or
EXEC ACTIVE to  override  the  default  null  parm  and  leave  PARM
unchanged.  For example, the command:

         EXEC FROM #LIBLIST PUBLIC NOPARM

will not change the PARM value (convenient for EXEC files which call
other EXEC files).  Additional examples are:

         EXEC 28 PARM '&UUU.X'
         EXEC 800 SAVE PARM (1,2,3)
         EXEC RETURN PARM="OK"


*11/12/77  NEW LIKE OPTION ON SHOW DIRECTORY/CATLG COMMANDS

The "LIKE=text" option will now work on the SHOW DIRECTORY and  SHOW
CATLG  commands.   The option has the same syntax as the LIKE option
on the SHOW DSNAMES command.  For example, the command:

         SHOW DIRECTORY IN LIB LIKE LOG

will display the names of all members in LIB which start with the
characters "LOG".


*11/12/77  USER COMMAND DEFINITION FACILITY

A new command definition facility lets you define your own  commands
or  redefine  existing system commands.  These user defined commands
last for the duration of  the  current  session.   Defined  commands
currently  only  allow  simple  text substitution to form a "system"
command.  In verbose mode, the substituted command is typed  at  the
terminal  before  it  is  executed.  In addition, command retry will
display the command after the define text has been substituted.  The
syntax for defining a new command is:

         DEFINE name AS 'replacement text' [APPEND 'append text']
                     [ABBREVIATE] [REPLACE]
where:

name     is the command name.  If it is longer than eight characters
         only the first eight characters are saved and only the
         first eight characters need be used to reference the
         command.

AS 'replacement text'
         specifies text which is to replace "name".

APPEND 'append text'
         specifies text which is to be appended to the end of the
         command.

ABBREVIATE  specifies that the "name" can be abbreviated to the
         first three or more characters.

REPLACE  specifies that the command definition can replace a
         previous definition.  If omitted, the user will be prompted
         with "OK TO REPLACE name?".  REPLACE will also let you
         redefine an already existing WYLBUR command without the
         ok to replace prompt.

The UNDEFINE command can be used to remove a user command.  UNDEFINE
is the only WYLBUR command which itself can not be redefined.  The
syntax for UNDEFINE is:

         UNDEFINE name

where  "name"  is  the  command  name  or  partial  name  if  it  is
abbreviatable.  The command:  CLEAR DEFINED will undefine  all  user
commands.   The command:  SHOW DEFINED will display all user defined
commands.  The format of the responses are as follows:

         name - replacement text...append text

To indicate the abbreviation, all characters  in  "name"  after  the
minimum acceptable abbreviation are shown in lower case.

Some examples...

         COMMAND? define display as 'call display (p) ' abbreviate
         COMMAND? dis clr
         CALL DISPLAY (P) CLR
         .....
         COMMAND? define fj as 'fetch ' append ' sysout=c display'
         COMMAND? fj *
         FETCH * SYSOUT=C DISPLAY
         .....
         COMMAND? define # as 'exec from lib#' append ' on catlg'
         COMMAND? #find
         EXEC FROM LIB#FIND ON CATLG
         .....
         COMMAND? define spires as 'call spires (b' append ')'
         COMMAND? spires w
         CALL SPIRES (BW)
         .....
         COMMAND? define asm as 'exec from #asm parm (' append ')'
         COMMAND? asm x,y,z
         EXEC FROM #ASM PARM (X,Y,Z)
         .....
         COMMAND? show defined
         USER COMMANDS:
         DISplay - CALL DISPLAY (P) ...
         FJ - FETCH ... SYSOUT=C DISPLAY
         # - EXEC FROM LIB#... ON CATLG
         SPIRES - CALL SPIRES (B...)
         ASM - EXEC FROM #ASM PARM (...)
         COMMAND? CLEAR DEFINED
         COMMAND? SHOW DEFINED
         NO USER COMMANDS DEFINED


*11/12/77  SHOW STATUS COMMAND EXTENDED

A bug in "SHOW STATUS JOB *" causing it to use the WYLBUR  generated
jobname  instead  of  the  actual  last  jobname  submitted has been
corrected.  SHOW STATUS now displays after the requested region, the
actual amount of the region that is currently in real  memory.   For
example:

         320K-64K(128K)

means that the requested region is 320k of which 64K has never been
used and currently 128K is in core.

Two new options are of primary use to assembly language programmers
are:

TCBS     shows the tcb address for all tasks displayed.

RBS      shows the rb chain and PSW instruction address in each
         rb for all tasks displayed.


*11/12/77  UPPER/UPLOW OPTION ON EDITING COMMANDS

The UPPER/UPLOW options have been added to provide a local  override
of the session case setting on the following commands:

         COLLECT
         INSERT
         REPLACE
         MODIFY
         EDIT
         READ

For example:

         INSERT 123 UPLOW
or
         READ STRING S0 PROMPT 'USER? ' UPPER


*11/12/77  MODIFY AND EDIT COMMANDS EXTENDED

The MODIFY and EDIT commands have been  redone  to  allow  many  new
options.  The following describes the changes to these commands.

MODIFY
------

The syntax is:

         MODIFY [<range>] [COLUMNS|COLS n[/m]] [SINGLE|S]
                          [UPPER|UPLOW] [<list options>]

The prompt for modifications has  been  changed  from  "ALTERS?"  to
"MODS?".

The COLUMNS option has been added which restricts  the  modification
to the columns specified.  When text is deleted, blanks are inserted
at  the  ending  column  and any text past the last column specified
will be lost (a message to that effect will be given).

Some new MODIFY characters have been added as well as a way of doing
multiple  inserts,  deletes,  and  replaces  by  using  the   length
specification  options.   A  new  category  of  options called "line
oriented functions" provide new capabilities.

The modify characters available are:

   L     list.  No changes.

   N     nolist.  No changes.

[n]I     insert text.  New length specification allowed.

[n]R     replace text.  New length specification allowed.

[n]D     delete text.  New length specification allowed.

[n]X     expel text (new option).  Expel is the same as delete
         except that blanks are not treated as a continuation of the
         deletion range.  Using "X" instead of "D" lets you delete
         multiple pieces of text with one modification.

[n]B     blank text.  New length specification allowed.

[n]C     case change (new option).  Inverts the case of the text
         (i.e., uppercase becomes lowercase and lowercase becomes
         upper case).  Case change is ignored if the character is
         non-alphabetic.

[p]T     Tab (new option).  This logically positions the "cursor" so
         that it is under column "p".  For example, the sequence
         "72TIX" will position the cursor to column 72 and insert an
         "X".  If "p" is an asterisk, the cursor will be positioned
         to the end of the line.

   S     split line (new option).  Split allows you to "split" a
         line into one or more lines.  The new line(s) go after the
         original line (WYLBUR selects an appropriate delta).  The
         portion of the line after the "S" is created as the new
         line.  The lines are listed and you are then prompted for
         modifications for the "newest" line (i.e., the line that
         was created after the last "S").  A reply of ATTN (only) to
         the "MODS?" prompt will abort the previous split.  Modifying
         the new line confirms the split and changes the active file
         at that time.

   .     line oriented function (new option).  The dot signifies
         that what follows is a line oriented function.  These
         functions are currently available:

         DELETE     deletes the line.

         REPLACE    replaces the entire line.  A  line  prompt for
                    the replacement will follow.

         JOIN       appends the next line to the line currently
                    being modified.  The  joined  line is deleted
                    when the modification is accepted.

         REVERT     the line reverts back to its original contents
                    (i.e., before any modifications were made).

         SKIP       modifications to the current line are ignored
                    and the modification process proceeds with the
                    next line in the range.

         TERMINATE  the entire command is terminated and any
                    modifications to the current line are ignored.


length specification  (identified above as "[n]")

The length specification is the number of  characters  which  follow
the  modify  character  in  the  case of "I" or "R" or a duplication
factor with the other modify characters.  The number can be  between
1 and 133.  If "*" is used as the length specification, the number of
characters  which  remain  in  the  line is used as the length.  For
example:

         10B        means blank the next ten characters starting
                    under the "1".

         *C         means change the case of all the characters
                    (starting at the character above the "*") that
                    remain in the line.

         2I//       means insert "//" before the character above the
                    "2".  Other modifications can follow this
                    sequence, which would not be the case with just
                    "I//".

         20D or 20X deletes the next 20 characters.

         *RTEXT     replaces the rest of the line with "text".

         *D or *X   deletes the rest of the line.



EDIT
----

The syntax is:

         EDIT   [<range>] [COLUMNS|COLS n[/m]] [SINGLE|S]
                          [UPPER|UPLOW] [<list options>]

COLUMNS works the same way as it does on the MODIFY command (see
description above).

In addition, the "line oriented functions" (described under "."
modify character above) can be used by typing a "." as the first
character and following it with the function name.



COMMAND RETRY
-------------

All the MODIFY command extensions with the exception of Split and
the line oriented functions DELETE, REPLACE, and JOIN are available
in command retry.


*11/09/77  OPTIONS ADDED TO ALTER COMMAND

The following new options have been added to the ALTER command:

   FORMS    - changes the forms code
   FCB      - changes the FCB (carriage control)
   CARRIAGE - same as FCB
   CHARS    - changes the print train or 3800 character set
   TRAIN    - same as CHARS
   UCS      - same as CHARS
   PRINTER  - changes the printer type specification
   PRT      - same as PRINTER
   SYSOUT   - changes the SYSOUT class
   BIN      - changes the bin number

The BIN parameter may be specified for jobs in the execution or
output queues.  The other new parameters may only be specified for
jobs in the output queue.

If the FORMS code for a job is altered, HASP will automatically
alter the carriage control and printer type to the defaults for that
forms code, unless a specific FCB or PRINTER type is given
explicitly.  For example:

 ALTER 1234 FORMS 1181          sets FORMS=1181, FCB=8, PRT=3800

 ALTER 1234 FORMS 1181 FCB 12   sets FORMS=1181, FCB=12, PRT=3800

If no 3800 character set was specifically specified in the JCL of
the job, HASP selects a default character set at printing time based
on the forms code.  In this case, altering the forms code also
alters the character set with which the job will be printed.  If a
3800 character set was explicitly specified in the job's JCL and a
different character set is desired when the job's output parameters
are being altered, then a new character set must be specified on the
ALTER command using the CHARS parameter.  Only one character set may
be specified in the ALTER command; multiple character sets cannot be
specified.

The SYSOUT and FORMS parameters can be used to selectively ALTER
part of a job's output.  For example:

  ALTER 1234 SYSOUT A   -   alters all job output to SYSOUT=A
  ALTER 1234 SYSOUT C TO SYSOUT A  - alters all SYSOUT=C output to
                                       SYSOUT=A

  ALTER 1234 FORMS 1181 -  alters all job output to FORMS=1181
  ALTER 1234 FORMS 1411 TO FORMS 1181 -  alters all FORMS=1411
                                          output to FORMS=1181

The 'TO' option is used to indicate how the FORMS and SYSOUT options
are to be interpreted.


*11/07/77  HASP COMMANDS FOR BATCH INFORMATION

A class of HASP operator commands can be used to display information
at the terminal about such things as output devices, execution queues,
batch job status, etc.  Though the information provided is not in a form
similar to that of the various SHOW commands available to the terminal
user, they provide much information that is presently unavailable by
any other means.  The basic form of the command is:

     COMMAND> $D[letter]

where [letter] is replaced by one of a specific set of values.

$DD            Displays the device addresses and volume serials of all
               disks and drums currently available.

$DF[,n]        Gives the number of jobs queued for output at a specific
               station, by forms code.  For example, "$DF,1" displays
               the information for Pine Hall (remote station 1).
               Similarly, "$DF,O" displays the Encina output queue.
               (Encina is assumed if the comma and n are left off.)

$DN            Gives information on all jobs currently non-active, i.e.,
               awaiting execution, printing, or punching.  Other options
               describe only certain jobs, as follows:

                  $DN,[,n] [S|X|O] [CLASS=n] [FORMS=n] [SYSOUT=n]

               where "n" stands for a remote station number, "S" is for
               setup, "X" is for execution, and "O" is for output.  For
               example:

                  $DN,1 FORMS=9511
                  $DN SYSOUT D
                  $DN,21 S

$DQ            Tells the number of jobs queued for execution, output, or
               hold by job class (if awaiting execution) or by destination
               (if awaiting print).

$DR[n]         Displays the status (inactive or active, forms mounted,
               carriage tape, print train, queue) of all remote station
               devices (card reader, printers) or the status of devices
               at a specific remote station.  For example, $DR21 displays
               the status of all devices at remote 21.

$DA            Lists job information for each active job in the system,
               i.e., being read in, executing or printing.

$DI[n]         Displays information about all or a specific initiator:
               whether it is active or not, and which job classes it is
               handling.  For example, $DI12 to display information
               for initiator 12.

$DU            Gives the status of all HASP-controlled, non-direct
               access devices, usually unit-record devices such as
               card readers and printers.

$DLINEn        This command displays the status of unit-record hardware
               devices connected on the specified (n) RJE line.  Pine
               Hall is line 1.


*09/26/77  PRINT COMMAND TITLE AND INDENT OPTIONS MADE MORE CLEAR

To specify a title for an offline listing, you  may now use the
option:  TITLE="string" For example,
     print uplow copies 3 title "study6 on pub003"

That new syntax avoids ambiguity between the title string and the
associative range on the command.  For example,
     print "1977" title "year 1977 data only"

Another option that has been given a new syntax is the indent
option which can now be specified as INDENT=n  rather than the old
form of (n).  For example,
    print indent 5
will produce a listing indented 5 spaces from the margin.

Both the new and the old syntax may be used.


*09/26/77  DEFAULT ON PRINT COMMAND IS NOW BACK

By default, text with backspaces in it will now be printed correctly
as it is on a terminal.  If you do not want backspaces in your text
printed, specify NOBACK.


*09/22/77  CLASS OPTION ADDED TO RUN COMMAND

You can now specify the job class on the RUN command.  For example,
    RUN CLASS=Q
Specifying the job class on the command will override any job class
specification in the JCL.


*09/22/77  PRINT COMMAND HAS NEW OPTIONS FOR 3800 PRINTER

Two new options that have recently been added to HASP to support the
3800 printer are now available on the PRINT (list offline) command.
The options are:
    CHARS=cccc                     character set to use
                                   (e.g., GF10, GF12, GF15)
    PRINTER|PRT=3800|1403|ANY      type of printer to use
Refer to the document "Using the 3800 Laser Printer" for more
information on using WYLBUR commands to direct your output to that
printer.


*09/22/77  FETCH COMMAND CC OPTION

You can now retrieve the ASA carriage control characters as the
first character of each fetched line by using the "CC" (or alias
"ASA") option.  The option works the same way the "MC" (machine
control) option works.  The MC and CC options are mutually
exclusive.


*09/22/77  SHOW IPLTIME COMMAND ADDED

This command shows the time (and date) of the last IPL (when the
system was intially loaded).


*09/22/77  (EFFECTIVE 09/30) PRINT CHANGES TO TAKE EFFECT

Currently, the first page of a PRINT job starts with one blank line
so the first page has one less user text line than subsequent pages.
This is going to be changed so the first page will no longer start
with a blank line.  Also, the "CONTINUED" line that the PRINT job
generates if the line is greater than 132 chars will no longer be
given.  Instead, the line will be truncated to the maximum printer
carriage width.


*09/02/77  PRINT, PUNCH, AND SUGGEST JOBS NOW IN CLASS=Q

The jobs for the WYLBUR commands PRINT (LIST OFFLINE), PUNCH and
SUGGEST now run in Class Q, which will reduce the system overhead
for these jobs.  In addition, the JCL page and the page that says
"LIST ... VERSION 2.1" are now suppressed.  There is a new "JCL"
option which will force the printing of the JCL page.


*09/02/77  BLOCK MAY NOW BE SPECIFIED ON JOB ENTRY COMMANDS

You can now specify the execution time block on RUN, CONDENSE,
PRINT, PUNCH, and SUGGEST commands.  The syntax is:

      BLOCK=DAY|EVENING|NIGHT|WEEKEND

For example:
     RUN BLOCK=WEEKEND or RUN BLOCK=W

Note that to specify a printing time block, you must still use the
ALTER command after the job has completed execution.


*09/02/77  RUN COMMAND HAS SEVERAL NEW OPTIONS

The following options (previously only available on PRINT) are now
available on the RUN command:

      COPIES=nn
      EJECT=nnn| NOEJECT|GRAPH
      FORMS=ffff
      CARRIAGE=cccc|FCB=cccc
      NOJCL


*09/02/77  JOB ENTRY COMMANDS ALLOWED FOR ANOTHER ACCOUNT

You can now FETCH, HOLD, RELEASE, PURGE, CANCEL, or ALTER jobs that
are not running under your (the signed on) account.  You must
specify the account of the job on the command.  For example:

      PURGE 1069 ACCOUNT X32$X2
      FETCH HISJOB USER X32 GROUP X2 CLEAR

You will be prompted for the keyword for that account, and if
answered correctly the command will be executed.


*08/27/77  MESSAGE MAY APPEAR ON SHOW CHARGES RESPONSE

SCIP Accounting can now set a message which you will get when you
say "SHOW CHARGES".  For example:

     ? show charges
     THE ACCOUNTING MESSAGE COMES FIRST, IF THERE IS ONE
     A32$X2 -
     CHARGES $ 32
     BUDGET $ 50


*08/27/77  ACCOUNT OPTION SYNTAX EXTENDED

WYLBUR now accepts either "gg.uuu" or "uuu$gg" format account.  For
example, either
     USE DATA ACCOUNT X2.A32
or
     USE DATA ACCOUNT A32$X2
is now acceptable.


*08/27/77  COMPARE COMMAND EXTENDED

Several changes have been made to the COMPARE command.  The syntax
is:
     COMPARE line-number#1 line-number#2 [list-options] [SINGLE]

The compare command compares two ranges starting at the lines
specified.  The comparison stops if the lines are not the same.  The
lines are then listed and (if neither SINGLE nor NOLIST is
specified), the user is prompted with

     CONTINUE?

A reply of "yes", "ok", or "continue" will resume the compare at the
next lines (this is handy when a line has changed, but no lines have
been inserted or deleted).  The comparison will resume with the next
lines in the range unless you request otherwise.  You may do so by
specifying two line-numbers after the yes/ok/continue.  For example:

     ok *,next
     -or-
     yes 15.1 5000.1

COMPARE now sets the current line pointer to the line in the first
range that does not match.  If all lines compare, the current line
pointer is set to "-1".  This change was made to make it possible
for EXEC files to determine the results of the compare.  The
following is a sample of how this might be used in an EXEC file:

     1.   use copy1 clear
     2.   copy from copy2 to 50000
     3.   compare first,50000 nolist
     4.   if (* eq -1) comment copy1 and copy2 are the same
     5.   else show value *


*08/27/77  EXEC COMMAND LIMIT MESSAGE CHANGED

The message that results when the EXEC file command limit is
reached;

1000 COMMANDS EXECUTED WITH NO TYPING -- CHECK FOR LOOP
has been changed to:
nnnn COMMANDS EXECUTED -- AT LINE n.


*08/27/77  EXEC FILES CAN NOW HAVE A LINE 0

A problem with EXEC files having a line 0 has been fixed.
Previously, the message "EXEC POINTER NOT SET" was erroneously
given.


*08/08/77  DISPLAY and SQUASH Options on FETCH Command

You can now look at the output from a job without having to put
it in your active file by using the "DISPLAY" option on FETCH.
The command "FETCH <jobid> DISPLAY" will type the response to your
terminal (instead of putting it in the active file).  The SQUASH
option squashes multiple blanks to a single blank when typing the
responses (it works the same way the SQUASH option on the LIST
command works).  If DISPLAY and CLEAR are both specified, CLEAR is
ignored.  All the other FETCH options are valid with DISPLAY
(e.g., NOMSG, SYSOUT=c).


*08/08/77  COUNT Option on USE

The USE command now has a "COUNT=n" option, where "n" is the maximum
number of lines to read.  This parallels the COUNT option on FETCH.


*08/08/77  AROUND Option on the CENTER Command

The CENTER command centers a line of text around a given LENGTH.
Specifying "AROUND=n" lets you center the text around an
arbitrary column.


*08/08/77  Quick MODIFY/EDIT during COLLECT, INSERT, and REPLACE

At the end of typing a line in response to a line-number prompt you
can type "@<attention>" and you will get a chance to MODIFY or EDIT
that line.  MODIFY or EDIT is selected based on your set mode (see
"SET MODE MODIFY|EDIT").  Just typing "@<attention>" will let you
modify the previous line for COLLECT, and the "old" copy of the line
for REPLACE.  For example,

          ? collect
              1.    ? this is line one
              2.    ? @<attention>
              1.      THIS IS LINE ONE
             ALTERS ?         ialtered
              1.      THIS IS ALTERED LINE ONE
              2.    ? this is line two@<attention>
              2.      THIS IS LINE TWO
             ALTERS ?

This provides a handy mechanism for quickly fixing minor typo's
without explicitly leaving and then re-entering collect mode.


*08/08/77  CHANGE Command Additions

Two new options have been added to the CHANGE command, they are:
MODIFY and EDIT.  Specifying this option lets you modify or edit the
changed line.  Hitting attention on the "ALTERS?" or "EDITS?" prompt
will leave the line entirely unchanged.  Also, on "CHANGE VERIFY"
you can now answer "modify" or "edit" to the "CHANGE?" prompt.  The
valid responses to the CHANGE prompt are now:
         YES, OK, or CHANGE  --  accept the changes
         MODIFY  -- switch into "modify" to allow further changes
         EDIT -- switch into "edit" to allow further changes
         anything else (including carriage return) -- reject changes


*08/01/77  MESSAGES SUPPRESSED FOR SOME EXEC FILE COMMANDS

Currently, typed commands (i.e., commands that you type, as opposed
to those that come from an EXEC file with NOLOG TERSE) are more
"verbose" than non-typed commands.  For example, the command:

     CHANGE 'A' TO 'B' NOLIST

will say "VOID CHANGE" if there were no lines with "A" and if the
command was typed.  The message is suppressed for non-typed commands
(as it would be annoying to be constantly getting these sort of
messages from EXEC files).  Another example is the suppression of
the "LAST LINE" message for non-typed commands.


*08/01/77  PUTTING DISPLAYED INFORMATION INTO YOUR ACTIVE FILE

Any WYLBUR "SHOW" command is now also a "DUMP" command (e.g., DUMP
DSNAMES).  The DUMP command puts the command responses at the end of
the active file (this parallels the ORVYL/CLP DUMP command).  An
alternate form is to specify the COLLECT option:

      COLLECT [line-no] [BY increment] [CLEAR]

on a WYLBUR command.  For example:

   ? clear active
   ? locate jdn collect
   2. - LAST LINE
   ? list
      1.    JOB 1109 JDN$PDIO AWAITING PRINT 6 F=1481 (OUTPUT HOLD)
      2.    JOB 1117 JDN$TLNK AWAITING PRINT 8 F=1481 (OUTPUT HOLD)
   ? dump dsnames
   VOLUME? enc105
   17. - LAST LINE

Please note that the DUMP command and COLLECT options are still
under test and may have the output results changed in the future.
The performance of the SHOW DSNAMES, SHOW CATALOG and SHOW DIRECTORY
commands is very poor when used with these features.  We are in the
process of trying to improve performance in these commands.

Programs like USERVTOC will provide the same information as a DUMP
DSNAMES on every volume, and is considerably cheaper to use
(probably faster too).

You can not get the contents of MILTEN commands into your active
file.  For example, DUMP LINES or DUMP USERS are not valid.


*08/01/77  IMPLIED DELETE, INSERT, REPLACE HAVE NOVICE MODE

If you feel uncomfortable with the short forms of insert, delete,
and replace commands, where you just specify the line-number
followed by text as a command,  for example,

         ? 13 this is a line replacement

there is now an option on the SET MODE command which will prompt for
approval of the insert/delete/replace request.  In this "NOSHORT"
mode, you get the following:

          ? 13 this is a line replacement
          REPLACE 13? ok

Also, you can specify the <list options> after the yes/ok.  For
example,

          ? 13 this is a line replacement
          REPLACE 13? ok list
              13.    THIS WAS THE OLD LINE

The default will initially be SET MODE SHORT so the new option will
not affect current users; however, we will be changing the
default to NOSHORT in the near future.

The NOSHORT mode only applies to typed commands so that EXEC files
may still use the implied form of the commands without causing
prompting if the user has SET MODE SHORT.


*08/01/77  THEN AND ELSE COMMANDS FOR EXEC FILES

         THEN <any command>
          - or -
         ELSE <any command>

WYLBUR now remembers whether the last IF command executed was true
or false.  You can use "THEN" or "ELSE" followed by any command.
This new command will be executed only if the previous IF command
executed was true (for THEN) or false (for ELSE).  For example,

         1. if (lines eq 0) exec 8
         2. read string s0 prompt 'ok to clear? '
         3. if (s0 eq 'ok')
         4. then comment active will be cleared
         5. then clear active
         6. else comment type "exec" when you are ready to clear
         7. else exec pause


*08/01/77  WARN OPTION ADDED TO SET MODE COMMAND

A new option added to the SET MODE command allows you to ask WYLBUR
to keep track of changes to your active file and warn you if you
have made a certain number of changes and try to clear the active
file.  For example,

    SET MODE WARN=30

will set the flag so that after 30 changes, if you attempt to clear
the active file, a warning will be issued.  To turn off the warning
mode, SET MODE NOWARN.

The warning mode may be overridden by specifying WARN or NOWARN as
an option on the following commands:

                    CLEAR ACTIVE
                    COLLECT
                    FETCH
                    RESTORE
                    SAVE
                    USE

The change count is updated as follows on completed commands:

        COMMAND          OPTION       CHANGE COUNT

        ALIGN/JUSTIFY    any          +1 per command
        CENTER           any          +1 per command
        CHANGE           VERIFY       +1 per approval
                         NOVERIFY     +1 per command
        CLEAR            ACTIVE       zeroed
                         any other    unchanged
        COLLECT          CLEAR        zeroed,+1 per typed line
                         any other    +1 per typed line
        COPY/MOVE        any          +1 per command
        DELETE           any          +1 per command
        FETCH            any          zeroed
        EDIT/MODIFY      any          +1 per line updated
        INSERT           DITTO        +1 per line typed
                         any other    +1 per line inserted
        NUMBER           any          +1 per command
        REPLACE          DITTO        +1 per line typed
                         any other    +1 per line replaced
        RESTORE          any          zeroed
        SAVE             any          zeroed
        SQUASH/SQUISH    any          +1 per command
        USE              any          zeroed


*08/01/77  NEW EXEC FILE VARIABLES

   LINE(line-number)  Gives you the contents of that line in
                      the active file.  If the line-number does not
                      exist the function returns the null string.
                      If the line does exist, but is "null", the
                      function returns a string of one blank.

   LINES              Returns the number of lines in the active
                      file.  Note "LIN" is an abbreviation for
                      the LINE function, not LINES.

   LIB                Returns the default library name.  The
                      signon default is "LIB", and it can be
                      displayed or set by the SHOW and SET LIBRARY
                      commands.

   DESTINATION        Returns the name of your destination for
                      jobs you submit (currently, it is either
                      "ENCINA" or "PINE").

   WARN               This is the number of the warn count. "-1"
                      means NOWARN mode (which is currently the
                      default).  This is set by the "SET MODE
                      WARN nn" command.

   CHANGES            This is the count of the number of changes
                      to your active file.  (See description of
                      WARN mode above).

   WIDTH              Returns what MILTEN thinks the terminal
                      carriage width is.  SHOW WIDTH displays this,
                      and SET WIDTH nnn will change it.


*08/01/77  NEW LIMIT OPTION ON SET EXEC COMMAND

There is a new "SET EXEC LIMIT nnnn/NOLIMIT" command which lets you
suppress the "nnnn COMMANDS EXECUTED WITHOUT TYPING" message.  The
default is 1000 commands without typing.  Turning off this facility
makes it easier to inadvertently get into a loop, and accumulate
large charges.


*08/01/77  SAVE...REPLACE COMMAND RETAINS DATA SET FORMAT

WYLBUR will now use whatever format the original data set had when
you say "SAVE dsn REPLACE".  Previously, it would rewrite the data
set as EDIT format (for sequential data sets) even if it were not
that format before.  If you want to replace a data set and also
change the format, you have to specify the new format explicitly
(e.g., SAVE dsn EDIT REPLACE).


*08/01/77  SHOW STATUS COMMAND FOR DETAILED JOB INFORMATION

              SHOW STATUS <JOB jobname> <TASKS> <ALL> <SYSTEMS>

where:

JOB jobname  -specifies that only information about jobs like the
            jobname (or partial jobname) is to be displayed.  If the
            jobname is put in quotes, only jobs with EXACTLY the
            same jobname will be displayed.  If no jobname is
            specified, all jobs for the  user will be displayed.

TASKS        -specifies that the task structure of the job is to
              be displayed (if this is NOT specified and the job
              does have multiple tasks "TASKING" will be added
              to the message).

ALL          -specifies that ALL jobs will be displayed.

SYSTEMS      -specifies that information about system jobs (such as
              HASP and WYLBUR) will be displayed.

Job information is displayed in the following format:

   jobname/stepname,coreK,program,Pprty<,TASKING>,sssS

where:

   jobname   -is the name of the job
   stepname  -is the name of the current step executing
   coreK     -is the REGION size of the current step
   program   -is the name of the "program" executing
   Pprty     -specifies the OS (not HASP) priority of the job,
              if this is suffixed by "I" it means that the job is
              considered I/O bound, if suffixed by "C" it means
              that the job is considered COMPUTE bound.
   <TASKING> -this is not given if the job does not have multiple
              tasks.  If the job does have multiple tasks and
              "TASKS" was specified, the complete task structure
              is displayed.
   sssS      -displays the number of seconds remaining in the
              current job-step.

Two additional messages appear giving system information:

370/168 STATUS  hh:mm:ss mm/dd/yy   nn IDLE INITIATORS

VS STATISTICS: nnnnK ALLOC, nn FREE PGS

The VS STATISTICS display the amount of core allocated to ALL jobs,
and also the number of free VS pages.


*08/01/77  SHOW COLUMNS FORMAT CHANGED

The response from the "SHOW COLUMNS" command has changed a bit.  It
no longer sends text with backspace/underlines, and will now stop at
your terminal carriage "WIDTH".


*08/01/77  CONDENSE ALLOWED WITHOUT KEYWORD PROMPT

WYLBUR will no longer prompt "KEYWORD?" on CONDENSE commands if you
are condensing someone elses data set.  Instead, it will prompt
"OK?" -- This does NOT bypass the security system, so if you reply
ok when you don't have access to the data set the CONDENSE job
WYLBUR submits for you will ABEND S913.

Also, you won't be prompted for "VOLUME?" if you have a default
volume set.


*06/01/77  WYLBUR CATALOG GIVES FILE NUMBER

If you specify the file sequence number (in the LABEL parameter) of
a tape data set when it is cataloged, WYLBUR will now report the
file sequence number when you request the catalog entry to be
displayed.  For example:

     COMMAND? show catlg for SPSS5
     SPSS5 - on AS1505, FILE 3

*04/26/77  WYLBUR REFERENCE MANUAL UPDATE PACKAGE

An update package is available for the WYLBUR Reference Manual.  The
package includes pages to replace or append to the Third Edition.  All
changes to WYLBUR discussed in this file up to this date were included
in the documentation update.  We encourage all users who now have a
Reference Manual to get the update package, available from Document
Sales.  The new edition of the manual, with all updates included, is
also available for new users.


Effective June 1, all items in this file that are documented
in the update have been removed.  The file will be maintained for
new items but will be moved to DOCLIB.  To access the file after
June 1, you should USE DOCLIB#WYLDOC PUBLIC.


*03/28/77  WYLBUR PROMPT CHANGES WHEN IN UPLOW MODE

Effective Thursday, March 31, WYLBUR's command  prompt  will  change
when  you have SET UPLOW.  Instead of being prompted COMMAND?  or ?,
the prompt will appear as COMMAND> (or just > in terse mode).   This
change  is  intended to act as a constant reminder of your settings
since the prompt will remain ?  in UPPER mode.

The ">" character will be used as the COMMAND prompt and  on ALTERS,
EDITS  and  line number prompts.  However, when WYLBUR asks a direct
question, such as CLEAR?, CONDENSE?, REPLACE?  etc., a question mark
will always be used.

When you have SET BACK in effect, an additional change in the prompt
will occur:  the ?  (in UPPER) or > (in UPLOW) will be underlined.


*11/05/76  INCREASED BLOCKSIZE FOR WYLBUR DATASETS

The default blocksize for WYLBUR created datasets has been
increased.  This change is designed to improve performance by
reducing the number of disk I/O operations required to access
datasets, it should also somewhat reduce the elapsed time required
for these operations (e.g., USE, SAVE, COPY FROM).  The new maximum
blocksize is 6447 bytes, the old maximum blocksize was 3520 bytes.

The new and old blocksizes WYLBUR will use for 3330's are as
follows:

     dataset type           new format              old format
     ------------           ----------              ----------
     EDIT                   U/6447/6447             U/3156/3156
     PRINT (LRECL=133)      FB/133/6384             FB/133/3059
     CARD  (LRECL=80)       FB/80/6400              FB/80/3120

The blocksizes WYLBUR will use for the new 3350's are as follows:

     dataset type           new format
     ------------           ----------
     EDIT                   U/6233/6233
     PRINT (LRECL=133)      FB/133/6118
     CARD  (LRECL=80)       FB/80/6160

Sometime in the near future, WYLBUR will "automatically" increase
the blocksize on edit format PDS's so users can increase the
blocksize of their PDS's easily.

In view of these WYLBUR block sizes, users are reminded that the
linkage editor does not accept a blocksize greater than 3200 on
input.  Anyone saving object modules (which must be in card format)
via WYLBUR  should specify a blocksize of 3200 or less if the data
set is to be accessed from the batch.


*09/14/76  SHOW CHARGES FOR ANOTHER ACCOUNT

You may now issue a SHOW CHARGES command for an account other than
the logged on user providing you can supply the keyword for the
account.  The form of the command is:
  SHOW CHARGES FOR uuu$gg
where uuu$gg is the account number (like A63$N2).
