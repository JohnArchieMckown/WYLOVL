XEROX 4090 PRINTING

The following forms are available on the 4090 laser printer.  The
4090 replaces the Xerox 9700.  See DOC#SCHEDULE PUBLIC for a
schedule of their availability.  Paper is cut sheets, 8-1/2 x 11
inches.

   FORMS=BOND           standard white bond paper
   FORMS=3HOL           3-hole white bond paper
   FORMS=GBAR           3800 blue bar replacement, duplex
   FORMS=BLUE           blue paper
   FORMS=ARCB           Xerox archival bond
   FORMS=RAGB           100% cotton fiber bond
   FORMS=XL33           Gummed labels, 33-up (each label 1.0x2.83)

You can simulate the blue-bar pattern of forms 1181 on the 4090 by
coding FLASH=BAR4 in your JCL or in the PRINT command.  This flash
produces alternate grey and white bars, 4 bars per inch in landscape
mode.  It may be used with PFORMAT=L132 or PFORMAT=L150 to produce
output that resembles the 3800's 1181 forms.  Alternatively you can
code FORMS=GBAR, which is equivalent to the jobparm below:

   /*JOBPARM PFORMAT=L150,FORMS=3HOL,FLASH=BAR4,DUPLEX=YES

In a PRINT command, you might type:

   PRINT FORMS=BOND PFORMAT=L132 FLASH=BAR4

By printing listings, etc. on 3HOL DUPLEX, you can reduce the
volume of paper by half.

FCBs available are for line spacing of 6 thru 12 lines per inch on
the 4090; code FCB=6 for 6 lines per inch, FCB=12 for 12 lines per
inch, etc.  Code FCB=FULL for 6 lines per inch with the first print
line at the very top of the page.

Since printing on the 4090 is done on cut paper (separate sheets of
paper), the printed pages are either clipped together, or wrapped in
plastic, or put in a box, depending on the number of pages:

   3 to 20 pages are clipped with a plastic clip

   21 to 199 pages (about one inch thick) are wrapped in plastic,
   but without shrinking (to avoid paper curl)

   Output more than one inch but less than five inches thick is
   wrapped in plastic, with shrinking

   Output more than five inches thick is put in a box and labeled
   with the appropriate bin number; ask the operators for
   assistance

Use of user-supplied forms on the 4090 is by arrangement only; call
Production Services, 723-2701.
