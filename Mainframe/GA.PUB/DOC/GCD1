Title:  Greatest Common Divisor

Library Program Number:  C001

Subprogram name(s):  GCD1

Summary:  GCD1 finds the absolute value of the greatest common
divisor of two integer arguments using Euclid's algorithm.

Field of application:  Mathematics

Search key:  Greatest Common Divisor, Number Theory

Languages from which this routine may be called:  FORTRAN IV;
                                                  Assembler


Principal source language:  OS/360 Assembler Language

Type of routine:  Close, reentrant integer-type function subprogram,
standard OS/360 calling sequence

Machine on which routine will execute:  IBM System/360

Monitor or operating system required:  None

Special machine requirements:  None

Call:  I = GCD1(J,K)

Parameters:

     Parameter     Type                   Description

       J,K       fullword integers   arguments whose greatest common
                                     divisor is to be found (must be
                                     > 1).

      GCD1       fullword integer    function name must be declared
                                     integer since result is returned
                                     in general register 0.

Declarations:  None

Special system control cards needed:  None

Use:  A FORTRAN statement which stores at I the gcd of J and K is
I = GCD1(J,K)

Other input:  None

Other output:  None

Error conditions and messages:

Accuracy:  No roundoff errors, since all arithmetic is done on
integers in the general registers.

Time:  (42+47M) microseconds (Model 50) where M is the number of
division cycles required by the algorithm.

Non-library routines or subroutines required:  None

Library routines or subroutines required:  None

Library routines required:  None

Storage requirements:  38   = 56   bytes
                         16     10

Registers used:  General Register 0 contains the result, General
Register 1 is destroyed.
