0                                             INTRODUCTION
+                                             INTRODUCTION
-            SPIRES (an acronym for Stanford Public Information REtrieval System) is a pow-
             erful data base management system developed at Stanford that allows you to use
             simple English-like commands to add, modify, search for,  sort,  display,  and
             remove records of information.  SPIRES allows anyone to design and build their
             own data bases,  and a number of software tools exist to make this process ac-
             cessible to the non-programmer.  The designer of a particular SPIRES data base
             decides the names and types of the  individual pieces of information in a data
             base record,  and  also decides which of those elements  will be automatically
             indexed to facilitate subsequent data base searches.
0            Many people in the academic community maintain  card files or lists of biblio-
             graphic references to  facilitate their work,  and may find  it advantagous to
             put their references  into a data base  on the computer.   A  researcher might
             keep a bibliography of articles relevant to his or her area of study.   An au-
             thor might keep an annotated bibliography with notes and quotations from vari-
             ous sources as a  means of filing and retrieving ideas in  the course of writ-
             ing.   A manager of a small library  might keep a bibliography to simplify the
             process of searching for works in the library collection based on author,  ti-
             tle or topic criteria.
0            Storing bibliographic information  in a SPIRES data base  provides several ad-
             vantages over maintaining  a bibliographic card file.    Individual references
             can be easily  entered and modified using  either the WYLBUR text  editor or a
             built-in utility that prompts  for each element value.   The data  base can be
             searched in an iterative manner, using simple ad-hoc search criteria,  and the
             located references can be easily sorted and  displayed at the terminal or pre-
             pared for printing in several different formats.  The maintenance and use of a
             SPIRES data  base can also  be selectively extended  to other accounts  on the
             system.
0            This document describes a computer application that allows you to easily build
             and manage a SPIRES data base for the storage and processing of annotated bib-
             liographic references.   This application also  provides formats and protocols
             for displaying  and printing references in  the standard APA and  IEEE styles.
             All you do  is learn the basic SPIRES  commands that enable you  to create and
             use your private data base.   This document assumes that you know how to logon
             to the IBM 3081 and have a  basic knowledge of simple WYLBUR editing commands.
             Although no SPIRES experience is assumed, it is recommended that you enroll in
             the SPIRES Searching and Updating course, given each quarter at ITS,  or study
             the Œ‡ƒ	Œ Œ„‰’ˆ „’ Ž„›’ˆ manual,  available in Document Sales in For-
             sythe Hall, if you plan to make more than casual use of your data base.

+                             THE STRUCTURE OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE
-            It is recommended that  you read the first section of this  document to see if
             this system will be suitable for your needs before going through the procedure
             in Section 4  to build a data base.    If you decide that  this application is
             suitable, then the setup procedure described in Section 4 will ask a series of
             questions and then generate  a SPIRES data base on your  account consisting of
             three separate subfiles:  one for storing annotated bibliographic information,
             one for  storing journal abbreviation codes  and one for storing  topic codes.
             One of the choices you make during the setup procedure is to select a name for
             your bibliographic subfile.   The names for the other two subfiles are created
             by appending the words CODES and TOPICS to the name you provide.   To simplify
             the examples in this document, I will use the name BIBLIO for my bibliographic
             subfile,  thereby  causing the  other subfiles  to be  named BIBLIO  CODES and
             BIBLIO TOPICS.
0            As soon as you have created your SPIRES  data base,  you can begin using it to
             add, modify, and display records of information.   To use your data base,  you
             must first enter  SPIRES and then tell  SPIRES which subfile you  want to work
             with by selecting that subfile by name (in our example, BIBLIO).   Unless oth-
             erwise noted, all examples in this document will assume that the following two
             commands have already been typed:
0              > call spires
               -Welcome to SPIRES-3 ... if in trouble, try HELP
               -> select biblio

+            1.1   THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC SUBFILE
+                  ___ _____________ _______
0            Each record in your bibliographic subfile  describes a single reference and is
             made up of a  collection of named data elements.   When  entering a new record
             into your subfile, you provide the names and values of most of these elements,
             and SPIRES  automatically generates  the values  of some  additional elements.
             Once you have selected  a subfile,  you can ask to see the  names of data ele-
             ments as follows:
0              -> select biblio

0      Each line of the display shows the name of an element and one or more alterna-
       tive names (aliases)  for the element.   Note that most elements have an alias
       formed from the first  three characters of the element's main  name (for exam-
       ple, DATE, DAT).
0      Once you know the name of an element,  you  can find out what kind of value is
       expected for that  element by typing the command SHOW  ELEMENT DESCRIPTION FOR
       followed by the name  (or an alias)  of the element.    You may abbreviate the
       command to SHOW ELEM DESC if you wish.    Here is an example of an element de-
       scription:
0        -> show element description for author
0        Element AUTHOR, AUT
         This is the name of a specific person who authored the work being
         referenced. Multiple author names may be entered as separate element
         values. If you want the list of authors to end with the expression 'et
         al', then simply enter the value 'al' as the last author name.  If the
         work is authored by an organization or corporation rather than specific
         persons, then do not enter a value for this element.  This element is
         indexed along with the editor element.
         ->
0      The descriptions in the remainder of  this section are intended to familiarize
       you with the names of available data elements and the kinds of values that you
       should supply for each element.

0            Whenever you add a new bibliographic record,  SPIRES will automatically gener-
             ate values for the following special elements:
0            ID              Every record is automatically assigned  a unique number as the
                             value of  this key element when  the record is first  added to
                             the data base.  ID numbers are assigned sequentially, starting
                             at number one.  Once a record has been added and the ID number
                             assigned, you can directly display, modify,  or remove the re-
                             cord by using the number in an appropriate SPIRES command.
0            ENTERED         This element is automatically set to the date on which the re-
                             cord was first added to the data base.
0            MODIFIED        This element is automatically set to the date on which the re-
                             cord was last modified.
0            The ENTERED and MODIFIED elements are  useful for tracking maintenance activi-
             ties performed on your data base,  especially  if you are allowing several ac-
             counts to enter and change data.

0            CLASS is  a required element  that indicates what  type of reference  is being
             stored.   The bibliographic system expects every reference to be identified as
             one of the following nine classes:
0            Article         An article from an academic journal or a magazine.  The author
                             and title of  the article as well  as the name of  the journal
                             and date of publication are  usually included.   A volume num-
                             ber, issue number, and pages indication are often included.
0            Book            A work published  on its own,  usually by  a publishing house,
                             that may be one work in a larger series.   The author,  title,
                             publisher,  and date of publication  are usually included.   A
                             volume number,  series title,  and publishing address may also
                             be included.  Chapter and pages information may be included if
                             the reference is to part of the work.
0            Report          A work published on its own, like a book,  but having a report
                             number and often published by an  institution rather than by a
                             publishing house.  The author, title, institution, report num-
                             ber, and date of publication are usually included.
0            Thesis          A master's thesis published by a school.   The author,  title,
                             school, and date are usually included.
0            Dissertation    A PhD dissertation published by a school.   The author, title,
                             school, and date are usually included.

-      Manual          An instruction manual or piece of technical documentation.   A
                       manual sometimes contains an edition  number and is often pub-
                       lished by an organization.   The title, edition, organization,
                       and date of publication are  usually included.   If authorship
                       is credited to a specific individual,  then the author name is
                       included.
0      Collection      A work  being cited as a  whole consisting of a  collection of
                       papers or proceedings.  A collection often has an editor rath-
                       er than an  author and is often published  by an organization.
                       An editor, collection title, organization,  and date of publi-
                       cation are usually included.
0      Incollection    A specific work within a  collection of papers or proceedings.
                       The author and title of the specific  work as well as the edi-
                       tor and title of the collection are usually included.  The or-
                       ganization or publisher and date  of publication are also usu-
                       ally included.   Chapter and pages information may be supplied
                       if only a part of the specific work is being cited.
0      Other           This reference  type is included as  a catch all  category for
                       works that do not logically fit  into any of the other catego-
                       ries.

0            Four elements allow  you to include additional information  about a reference.
             These elements and their suggested uses are described below:
0            TOPIC           This element allows you to enter  key words or phrases,  sepa-
                             rated by commas,  to categorize  the reference.   Depending on
                             decisions made by the file owner,  topics may be restricted to
                             a predefined set of values.  This element is indexed, allowing
                             you to search  for and retrieve references based  on the words
                             or phrases that you enter.
0            ABSTRACT        This element  may be used to  store lines of  text summarizing
                             the contents of the reference.   Multiple lines of text may be
                             entered.
0            COMMENTS        This element, similiar to ABSTRACT,  may be used to store per-
                             sonal comments about  the reference.   Multiple lines  of text
                             may be entered.   For example, you may include notes about the
                             relevance of the  reference to your research  or an indication
                             of where the reference is physically located.   The file owner

+      1.2   THE JOURNAL CODES SUBFILE
+            ___ _______ _____ _______
0      This subfile is a  simple table that you can use  to associate short abbrevia-
       tions with the full names of commonly used journals.  The subfile contains two
       elements:   JOURNAL-CODE,  which is a code that you choose,  and JOURNAL-NAME,
       which is the full name of the journal (or book).   Once you have entered a re-
       cord in this subfile,  you can use the  code that you have defined in place of
       the full journal  name when adding or modifying a  bibliographic record.   The
       procedures for  entering and using  journal codes  are described in  detail in
       Section 2 of  this document.   Following are the element  descriptions for the
       journal codes subfile:
0      JOURNAL-CODE    A short code word or acronym that  you can use as an abbrevia-
                       tion for a  commonly used journal name.   You  should use only
                       letters and numbers,  although  special characters are permit-
                       ted.  Blanks  are stripped  from the code  value before  it is
                       stored.
0      JOURNAL-NAME    The full  name of  a journal (or  series or  collection title)
                       that you wish  to associate with a  journal abbreviation code.
                       Your value should be entered in upper and lower case.

+      1.3   THE TOPIC CODES SUBFILE
+            ___ _____ _____ _______
0      This subfile is a simple table for the storage of topic words and phrases.  If
       the file owner has decided to restrict topics to a predefined set of words and
       phrases,  then topics  must be entered into  this subfile before they  are as-
       signed to bibliographic references.   If topics are unrestricted, then you can
       completely ignore this subfile.   Each record  in the topic codes subfile con-
       sists of a TOPIC element, a RETAIN element, and a POINTER element.  The proce-
       dures for entering topics in this subfile are described in detail in Section 2
       of this document.   Following are the element descriptions for the topic codes
       subfile:
0      TOPIC           A topic word used to  categorize bibliographic records and al-
                       low index searches by topic.  The file owner has the option of
                       either restricting topic words to a predefined set,  or allow-
                       ing any  topic words to be  used when adding  bibiographic re-

-                            cords.   If you enter a phrase  instead of a single word,  the
                             blanks in the phrase will be converted to dashes (-),  for ex-
                             ample, HEALTH CARE will become HEALTH-CARE.
0            RETAIN          This element is  used to indicate that you wish  to retain the
                             associated topic word even when  no bibliographic records make
                             reference to the topic.  If you plan to predefine a controlled
                             set of topics before entering bibliographic records, then sup-
                             ply a value.  The value can be any character string, or it can
                             be null.   Otherwise, SPIRES will automatically remove the en-
                             tire topic entry when no  bibliographic records have the asso-
                             ciated topic value.
0            POINTER         These are pointers to bibliographic records containing the as-
                             sociated topic value, and are maintained by SPIRES and used to
                             perform index searches.   You should never manually add or re-
                             move pointers,  and you should never  remove a topic table re-
                             cord that contains pointers.   To get  rid of a topic,  remove
                             the RETAIN element  from the table record (if  it exists)  and
                             then remove all references to the topic from the bibliographic
                             records.   SPIRES will then automatically remove the table re-
                             cord.

-            Formats are  special processing routines  which can  be used to  customize the
             manner in which records are entered and displayed in SPIRES subfiles.  Formats
             can either be written  for specific subfiles,  or can be  written in a general
             way so that they  will work with any subfile.   The  formats described in this
             section bear many similarities to the  system format $PROMPT (described in the
             Œ‡ƒ	Œ Œ„‰’ˆ „’ Ž„›’ˆ manual),  but have been created specifically for
             use with bibliographic subfiles.

+                  ________ _____________ _______
0            Whenever you select your bibliographic subfile, a special format named $BIBLIO
             is set to control the manner in which you can add, modify, and display biblio-
             graphic records.   To see  a quick summary of the commands  that are under the
             control of this format, type the command SHOW FORMAT INFORMATION,  as the fol-
             lowing example demonstrates.
0              -> select biblio
               -> show format information
0              The following commands are provided by the $BIBLIO format:
0              SHOW FORMAT INPUT   - Shows which elements are included for input prompting.
               ADD                 - Prompts for new element values, creates a new record.
               USING ACTIVE ADD    - Reads values from active file, creates a new record.
               MERGE id            - Prompts for value changes, modifies specified record.
               TRANSFER id         - Moves a specified record to active file for editing.
               UPDATE              - Replaces a transfered record using active file values.
               DISPLAY id          - Displays a specified record in standard display style.
               USING APA  DIS id   - Displays a specified record in the APA display style.
               USING IEEE DIS id   - Displays a specified record in the IEEE display style.
               REMOVE id           - Removes a specified record from the data base.
0              The following commands provide general information about your data base:
0              SHOW ELEMENTS         - Shows the names of elements for your subfile.
               SHOW ELE DESC elem    - Describes a specified element in your subfile.
               SHOW INDEXES          - Shows the names of indexes for your subfile.

+      2.1.1   The ADD Command
+              ___ ___ _______
0      The easiest way to  add a new record to your bibliographic  subfile is to type
       the ADD command.   This causes the format to prompt,  element by element,  for
       all of the information necessary to construct a record.   This method is espe-
       cially useful when  you begin using your  subfile since it frees  you from the
       burden of  having to  remember element names  and provides  several additional
       conveniences.   At each prompt,  the format displays a backslash character (\)
       followed by the name  of a particular record element and  then pauses to allow
       you to enter  a value.   If you  do not want to  supply a value at  a specific
       prompt, press the RETURN key and the next element prompt will appear.  Several
       elements (AUTHOR, EDITOR, ABSTRACT and COMMENTS) allow more than one value oc-
       currence;  if you enter  a value,  you will be prompted  with the same element
       name for another value.    If you enter an invalid value  at some prompt,  the
       format will  display an error  message and  reprompt for an  acceptable value.
       When there are no more elements to be prompted for, SPIRES will add the refer-
       ence and report its newly assigned ID number.
0      You can type a  few specific responses to any prompt that  cause the format to
       take special action.   If you press the BREAK or ATTN key at any prompt,  then
       the format will display the following description of special responses:
0        At any element prompt you can enter a data value, you can press the RETURN
         key to move to the next element or you can type one of these commands:
0        ?          - Type ? for an explanation of the current element prompt.
         \Xit       - Type \X to cancel the add operation immediately and exit.
         \End       - Type \E to add the reference as entered so far and exit.
0        If you enter a backslash character (\) as the last character of a data
         value, then you will be prompted on a separate line for a continuation of
         that value. If you enter two backslashes as a value (\\) then a null value
         will be entered as an actual data value. The maximum length of any single
         data value is 1024 characters.
-      If you have just typed a value, but not yet pressed RETURN, and you see an er-
       ror in the value, you can either backspace and type over the error, or you can
       press BREAK to erase the entire value and retype.  Once you have typed a value
       and pressed RETURN,  you  cannot change that value until the  add operation is
       completed.   If, in the process of adding a record,  you see that a previously
       entered value is incorrect,  you have two choices.   You can type \X to cancel
       the add operation and start again, or you can complete the record and then fix
       the incorrect value using either the MERGE  command or the TRANSFER and UPDATE
       commands.
0      Assuming we have already selected the bibliographic subfile, we can proceed to
       enter a new book reference as follows:
0        -> add

               -Added record: 1
               ->
0            There are several points to make  concerning the above example.   First,  note
             that the format prompted for almost every element in the subfile, and for most
             of the responses, the RETURN key was pressed to move to the next element.   In
             a later part of this section,  we will see how to simplify the entry effort by
             controlling which element prompts are presented.  After the last prompt in the
             example was presented,  SPIRES  added the new record to the  data base and as-
             signed an ID value of 1 as the record's key.  Once you know the ID number of a
             record, you can use that number in an appropriate command to display,  modify,
             or remove the record.   As a final point,  note that there were no obvious er-
             rors in the example.  If I had typed an invalid CLASS value and then asked for
             help, the example might have begun like this:
-              \CLASS          x
0              Input Error:    CLASS must be either A,B,R,T,D,M,C,I or O.
0              \CLASS          ?
0              This element is used to classify a reference into one of nine predefined
               categories.  You must enter one of the following values when adding a
               reference, and may abbreviate your value to a single character:
0              Article         - An article from an academic journal or magazine.
               Book            - A book published on its own, perhaps one in a series.
               Report          - A work published by an institution, with a report number.
               Manual          - A piece of technical work, published by an organization.
               Thesis          - A master's thesis published by a school.
               Dissertation    - A doctoral dissertation published by a school.
               Collection      - A collection of papers or articles, cited as a whole.
               Incollection    - A specific work being cited within a larger collection.
               Other           - Any other reference not fitting one of the above classes.

0      If you know the ID number of a particular record,  you can display that record
       at your terminal by  typing DISPLAY followed by the record's  ID number.   Re-
       cords are presented in a form similar in  appearance to the form in which they
       were added.  Only elements that have been given values are presented, and ele-
       ments that may  occur more than once have their  values numbered sequentially.
       To display the record from the previous example, we could type the following:

       also be displayed in APA or IEEE format,   and the commands for doing this are
       described in Section 3.3.   In certain special cases,  the owner of a file may
       arrange it so that you automatically see records in either APA or IEEE styles.

0      The MERGE command operates  in a manner similar to the  ADD command.   You are

       record.   To start the merge process,  type MERGE followed by the ID number of
       the record you wish to modify.   For elements that can have only a single val-
       ue, the format will display the old value (if one exists)  and then prompt for
       a replacement value.   If you press the RETURN key,  the old value will be re-
       tained.   For elements that can have more than one value, the format will dis-
       play all the old values and their occurrence numbers (if they exist)  and then
       prompt for a replacement  for the first value.   If you  press the RETURN key,

-            the  old first  value  will be  retained  and  the format  will  prompt for  a
             replacement for the second value, and so forth.   When prompts have been given
             for all previously existing values,  the format  will then prompt for an addi-
             tional value,  thus providing a way to  append new values to the existing val-
             ues.
0            As with the  ADD operation,  a number  of special responses are  recognized at
             each prompt.   If you press the BREAK or  ATTN key at a prompt,  the following
             description of special responses will be presented:
0              At any element prompt you can enter a new value to replace the displayed
               value, you can press the RETURN key to retain the old value and continue
               at the next prompt, or you can type one of the following commands:
0                ?             - Type ? for an explanation of the current element prompt.
                \Xit           - Type \X to cancel the merge operation immediately and exit.
                \End           - Type \E to accept all changes entered so far and exit.
                \Next          - Type \N to skip immediately to the next element prompt.
                \Append        - Type \A to skip to the new-value prompt for the element.
                \Remove        - Type \R to remove the old value referred to by the prompt.
                \Change\x\y\   - Type \C\x\y\ to change 'x' to 'y' in the current value.
0              If you enter a backslash character (\) as the last character of  a  data
               value,  then  you will be prompted on a separate line for a continuation
               of that value. If you enter two backslashes as a value (\\) then a  null
               value will be entered as an actual data value. The maximum length of any
               single data value is 1024 characters.
0            The \A and \N  responses are useful for skipping over  the replacement prompts
             for elements with many values.   The \A  response allows you to quickly append
             new values, and \N gets you directly to the next element.  The \C response al-
             lows you to correct simple spelling errors  without having to retype an entire
             value.
0            To demonstrate the MERGE operation, we try to make some changes in our example
             record as follows:

0      Note that  existing element  values were highlighted  by being  connected with
       dots to their element names.   Replacement  values were entered for the TITLE,
       VOLUME and DATE elements,  and the RETURN key was pressed at most of the other
       prompts.   The special command \A was entered for TOPIC, causing the format to
       bypass replacement prompting  for the existing topic values.    The \R command
       caused the single occurrence of ABSTRACT to  be removed.   The \E command then
       caused SPIRES to accept all changes made and halt the prompting process.

+                    ___________ _______ _________
0            The examples of the ADD and MERGE  commands in the previous sections have been
             presented exactly as they would appear if  you were to select your subfile and
             try the examples.   When you select your subfile, the format initially assumes
             that you want to be prompted for all reference elements.   In practice,  it is
             more efficient to tell  the format to only prompt for  those elements that you
             expect to provide values for.   You do this by typing the command SET FORMAT *
             followed immediately by an indication of which elements you want included dur-
             ing prompting.   The format reads your  specification and remembers which ele-
             ments you have requested.  If you make an error in the specification, the pre-
             vious element selection settings are retained.
0            The simplest element setting specification is to include the name of a partic-
             ular bibliographic reference CLASS (Article,  Book,  Report,  Manual,  Thesis,
             Dissertation, Collection, Incollection, or Other).  The format knows what ele-
             ments are reasonable to include for each of these classes, and establishes the
             settings accordingly.   If you enter a CLASS name,  it must immediately follow
             the SET FORMAT * command and can be abbreviated to a single character.
0            Once you start changing the element settings,   you might want to to know what
             element settings are currently in effect.  At any time, you can ask the format
             to remind you what elements are included and excluded from prompting by typing
             the command SHOW FORMAT INPUT.   In  the following example,  we establish set-
             tings for the Article reference class and then ask to see the settings:
0              -> set format * article
               -> show format input
0              The following elements are now INCLUDED during ADD and MERGE prompting:
0                CLASS          AUTHOR         ORGANIZATION   TITLE          INSIDE
                 VOLUME         NUMBER         DATE           PAGES          NOTE
0              The following elements are now EXCLUDED during ADD and MERGE prompting:
0                EDITOR         CHAPTER        PUBLISHER      ADDRESS        TOPIC
                 ABSTRACT       COMMENT        SORTVAL
0              To control which elements will be presented during ADD and MERGE
               prompting, type the command SET FORMAT * followed immediately by a
               list of element names, separated by blanks.  Instead of an element
               list, you can type ALL to include all elements, or type a reference
               class name to include elements appropriate to that class.  If you
               type a plus or minus sign followed by a list, then elements will be
               included or excluded relative to the current settings.  If you make
               an error, previous settings are retained.  The formal syntax of the
               command is:
0              SET FORMAT * [elements|class|ALL] [ + elements] [ - elements]
               ->

-      This example  summarizes the procedure for  forming a more  complex specifica-
       tion.   Instead of a CLASS name,  you can type a list of the specific elements
       that you want included,  and elements not  appearing in the list will be auto-
       matically excluded.   If you want all elements  to be included again,  you can
       type the special keyword ALL.   Finally,  to cause specific elements to be in-
       cluded or excluded individually, place a plus or minus sign before the list of
       element names.    The following  annotated examples  demonstrate some  typical
       specifications:
0        -> set format * article + top abs
0           (includes article elements plus topic and abstract)
0        -> set format * aut tit ins vol num dat
0           (include author, title, inside, volume, number, and date)
0        -> set format * - vol num
0           (excludes volume and number from current settings)
0        -> set format all - org edi sortval
0           (includes all elements except organization, editor, and sortval)
0        -> set format *
0           (same as SET FORMAT * ALL)
0      To demonstrate the extent to which a carefully chosen element setting specifi-
       cation can simplify the merge process,  we can take our example record and re-
       turn it to its original form with the following commands:
0        -> set format * tit vol dat top abs
         -> merge 1

0            We have seen how  to add and modify bibliographic records  using commands that
             prompt for values.    The advantage of such  a prompting strategy is  that the
             format remembers  the names of  elements and  can provide error  detection and
             help instantaneously.   The  disadvantage is that you are often  forced to re-
             spond to extraneous prompts or to learn to control and keep track of which el-
             ements are included for prompting.   The  commands introduced in the remainder
             of this section describe an alternative strategy for adding and modifying bib-
             liographic records  that allows you  to prepare  records in the  WYLBUR active
             file and then move them into the data base.   The discussion and examples pre-
             sume that you are  already familiar with the WYLBUR editing  commands for col-
             lecting, deleting, and modifying lines of text in your active file.
0            To add a new bibliographic record using this technique,  first collect in your
             active file the  reference information by using WYLBUR  editing commands.   To
             enter each piece of element data in your active file,  collect a line that be-
             gins with a backslash character (\),  followed immediately by an element name,
             followed by one or more blanks,  followed  by the value that you are providing
             for that element.   The element value  can actually continue for several lines
             and is terminated when the backslash character  that starts a new element name
             is encountered or when the end of  the active file is reached.   The backslash
             does not actually  have to be placed in  column one and data  for several ele-
             ments could be combined on a single line,   but in practice it is more conven-
             ient to enter one element per line.
0            When all of the information for a new record is in your active file, press the
             BREAK key to get out of WYLBUR collect  mode,  and then type the command USING
             ACTIVE ADD.  SPIRES will attempt to build a new record from the information in
             your active file,  and will report the ID number for the new record if the add
             operation is successful.  If SPIRES finds an invalid value for an element (for
             example,  1/32/83 is an invalid date),  an  error message is displayed and the
             reference is not added.    Correct the line in the active  file and type USING
             ACTIVE ADD again.

0            The disadvantage of this  method of adding records is that  you need to supply
             the names of elements.   The advantages are that you can enter the elements in
             any order and you  need only deal with the elements that  you have values for.
             This method of adding  records is also slightly less expensive  than using the

-      prompting  method.    If  you  need to  refresh  your  memory  concerning  the
       description of a particular element,  you can always use the SHOW ELEMENTS and
       SHOW ELEMENT DESCRIPTION commands, as in the following example:
0        -> show elem desc date
0        Element DATE, DAT
         This is the date when the work being referenced was published.  The
         value must be a legitimate day, month, or year.  Examples of valid dates
         include '1970', 'June 1981', and '12/25/82'.  Note that a date value like
         'Fall 1979' is not valid.  This element is indexed.

0      This procedure for modifying a record is similiar to that for adding a new re-
       cord, described in the previous subsection.   The first step is to move a copy
       of the record you  wish to modify into your active file  by typing the command
       TRANSFER followed by the ID number of the desired record.  When a copy of that
       reference is in your active file, you can use WYLBUR editing commands to modi-
       fy existing  values or to  add and delete pairs  of element names  and values.
       When you have completed your modifications, type the command UPDATE to replace
       the old version of the record with the  new version.   If the update fails and
       error messages are displayed, you should locate the errors, correct them,  and
       then type UPDATE again.

0            This basic SPIRES command is included in  this section to complete the discus-
             sion of commands for managing your bibliographic  data base.   To erase a par-
             ticular record from your bibliographic subfile, type REMOVE followed by the ID
             number of the chosen record.   The record will  seem to vanish,  but a copy of
             the record  will remain hidden  within your subfile  until the next  time your
             file is processed (shortly after midnight each night).  This means that if you
             change your mind, you can recover the removed record if you take action before
             your file is  processed.   The procedures for recovering  removed records (and

+                  ________ _______ _____ _______
0            Your bibliographic subfile  has an associated auxiliary subfile  which you can
             use to define abbreviation codes to represent commonly used names of journals.
             Whenever  you select  your  journal codes  subfile,   a  special format  named
             $BIBLIO.CODES is set to control the manner in which you can add,  modify,  and
             display journal codes records.    To see a quick summary of  the commands that
             are  under  the  control  of  this  format,   type  the  command  SHOW  FORMAT
             INFORMATION, as the following example demonstrates.
0              -> select biblio codes
               -> show format information
0              The following commands are provided by the $BIBLIO.CODES format:
-                                                - 19 -
1
-        ADD               - Prompts for new element values, creates a new record.
         USING ACTIVE ADD  - Reads values from active file, creates a new record.
         MERGE code        - Prompts for value changes, modifies specified record.
         TRANSFER code     - Moves a specified record to active file for editing.
         UPDATE            - Replaces a transfered record using active file values.
         DISPLAY code      - Displays a specified record in standard display style.
         REMOVE code       - Removes a specified record from the data base.
0        The following commands provide general information about your data base:
0        SHOW ELEMENTS       - Shows the names of elements for your subfile.
         SHOW ELE DESC elem  - Describes a specified element in your subfile.
         ->
0      The above commands operate in exactly the  same manner as the commands availa-
       ble for the bibliographic subfile,  but the  only elements in this subfile are
       named JOURNAL-CODE and JOURNAL-NAME.   Because of the simple structure of this
       subfile,  the ADD,  MERGE,  DISPLAY,  and  REMOVE commands handle most of your
       needs.   The following example demonstrates how to add, modify,  and display a
       journal code record:
0        -> select biblio codes
         -> add
0        \JOURNAL-CODE   jaes
         \JOURNAL-NAME   Journal of the Acoustical Engineering Society
         -> merge jaes
0        \JOURNAL-CODE...JAES
         \JOURNAL-NAME...Journal of the Acoustical Engineering Society
         \JOURNAL-NAME   Journal of the Audio Engineering Society
         -> display jaes
0        \JOURNAL-CODE   JAES
         \JOURNAL-NAME   Journal of the Audio Engineering Society
         ->
0      In this subfile, the JOURNAL-CODE element is the key of the record, and can be
       used to identify the record in the MERGE and DISPLAY commands.   To remove the
       record shown above,  you could type REMOVE JAES and that code would be removed
       from the subfile.
0      The advantage in defining abbreviation codes for journal names is that you can
       then use  those codes  directly when adding  and modifiying  bibliographic re-
       cords.   The  element named INSIDE within  the bibliographic subfile  is where
       journal names are normally entered.  When entering a value for the INSIDE ele-
       ment, if you enter an at-sign character (@)  followed immediately by a journal
       code,  the format will search the journal codes subfile and retrieve the asso-
       ciated journal name, as in the following example:
0        -> select biblio
         -> set format * title inside
         -> add

0            The final example in this section shows how you can produce a nicely formatted
             alphabetic table of your journal codes and names.  The sequence of commands to
             do this are:
0              -> select biblio codes
               -> set nolist
               -> /set length 102
               -> set format $report journal-code(12) journal-name(25)
               -> for subfile
               +> in active display all
               +> endfor
               -> print unn cc forms=bond chars=cu12
0            If you want  to continue adding or  modifying journal codes after  doing this,
             you must select your codes subfile again to restore the proper format.

+            2.3   MANAGING TOPICS TABLE RECORDS
+                  ________ ______ _____ _______
0            Associated with  your bibliographic subfile is  an auxiliary subfile  in which
             you can store a  controlled set of topic words and phrases  that can be subse-
             quently used to  categorize bibliographic records.   The  file owner initially
             determines whether or not topics will be  restricted to a predefined set.   If
             topics are unrestricted,  then there is no need to pay attention to the topics
             table.   If topics are restricted,  then each  topic must be entered into this
             table before it can be used in a bibliographic record.  The decision of wheth-
             er or not to restrict topics can also be reversed by following a procedure de-
             scribed in Section 4.
0            Whenever  you  select your  topics  table  subfile,   a special  format  named
             $BIBLIO.TOPICS is set to control the manner in which you can add, modify,  and
             display topics table records.  To see a quick summary of the commands that are
             under  the control  of  this  format you  can  type  the command  SHOW  FORMAT
             INFORMATION, as the following example demonstrates:
0              -> select biblio topics
               -> show format information
0              The following commands are provided by the $BIBLIO.TOPICS format:
0                                                - 21 -
1
-
         ADD               - Prompts for new element values, creates a new record.
         USING ACTIVE ADD  - Reads values from active file, creates a new record.
         MERGE topic       - Prompts for value changes, modifies specified record.
         DISPLAY topic     - Displays a specified record in standard display style.
0        The following commands provide general information about your data base:
0        SHOW ELEMENTS       - Shows the names of elements for your subfile.
         SHOW ELE DESC elem  - Describes a specified element in your subfile.
         ->
0      Each topics table record  contains a TOPIC element as the  key,  a RETAIN ele-
       ment,  and a POINTER element (which should not be disturbed).   Because of the
       simple structure of the  records in this subfile,  the ADD  and MERGE commands
       handle most of your needs.   The following example shows how to enter new top-
       ics into the table:
0        -> select biblio topics
         -> add
0        \TOPIC          physics
         \RETAIN         yes
         -> add
0        \TOPIC          chemistry
         \RETAIN         yes
         ->
0      Enter a value for RETAIN;  it can be  anything you choose but do not press the
       RETURN key as the only response.   For example, you could enter the word 'yes'
       or you could enter a null value by typing two backslash characters.  This will
       hold the topic record in the table until you enter a bibliographic record that
       uses the topic.
0      Never use the REMOVE command to remove a topic table record.   The topic table
       also serves as a topic index and if  you remove the table record you may throw
       away index pointers and create problems.  The proper way to get rid of a topic
       table record is to use the MERGE command to remove the value of the RETAIN el-
       ement,  and  then remove all references  to that topic from  the bibliographic
       data base.   If you follow this procedure,  then SPIRES will automatically get
       rid of the topic record for you.
0      The final example  in this section will  show how you can  put an alphabetical
       list of your topics into the active file  (where you can save it or print it).
       The sequence of commands to do this is:
0        -> select biblio topics
         -> set nolist
         -> for subfile
         +> in active show keys all
         +> endfor

0            3.1   A DESCRIPTION OF INDEX SEARCHING
+            3.1   A DESCRIPTION OF INDEX SEARCHING
+                  _ ___________ __ _____ _________
0            In SPIRES,  there are several methods for gathering together records that meet
             some criteria that  you specify.   The simplest  way is to search  the indexes
             that are automatically provided with your bibliographic subfile.   In describ-
             ing how indexes work,  it is useful to  draw an analogy between the records in
             your file and the books in a library.    Each book (a record)  in a library (a
             subfile)  sits on the shelves and can  be uniquely identified and retrieved by
             its call number (an ID number).  Libraries usually maintain author, title, and
             subject card catalogs (indexes) that you can search to obtain a list (a search
             result) of call numbers of books to inspect.  Stretching the analogy to make a
             point,  when a new book comes into a library,  it is placed on a special shelf
             until a librarian has a chance to create  new catalog cards for it and move it
             to the main shelves.
0            In SPIRES, new records (and ones that have been modified) are stored in a spe-
             cial area called the  deferred queue until shortly after midnight  when a pro-
             gram called SPIBILD  processes your file to  update the indexes for  those re-
             cords and move them to a permanent  storage area (called the tree).   The main
             point in all of this is that newly  added (or modified)  records cannot be re-
             trieved by searching indexes until SPIBILD has processed your file.  Note that
             if you have just added records and do  not want to wait for overnight process-
             ing,  you can process your file directly by following a procedure described in
             Section 4 of this document.
0            Assuming that you  have already selected your bibliographic  subfile,  you can
             ask to see the names of indexes by typing the following:
0              -> show indexes
               Goal Records:  REFERENCE
               Simple Index:  CLA, CLASS
               Simple Index:  AUT, AUTHOR, EDI, EDITOR
               Simple Index:  ORG, ORGANIZATION
               Simple Index:  TIT, TITLE
0                                                - 23 -
1
-        Simple Index:  DAT, DATE
         Simple Index:  TOP, TOPIC, TOPICS
         Simple Index:  KEY, KEYS, KEYWORD, KEYWORDS
0      Each line  represents an individual index  and shows the different  names that
       can be used to refer to the index.   Note that the names are the same as names
       of elements  in your subfile  and indicate  from which elements  those indexes
       were constructed.  For a description of any of these indexes, type the command
       SHOW INDEX DESC followed by the name of an index, as in the following example:
0        -> show index desc author
0        This index lets you retrieve records based on the names of authors
         and editors.  This index is organized as a personal-name index, and
         therefore offers some flexibility in the way you specify your search.
         For example, a reference with an author stored as DON KNUTH would be
         retrieved by the requests FIND AUTHOR DON KNUTH, FIND AUTHOR D KNUTH
         or FIND AUTHOR KNUTH.
0        -> sho index desc title
0        This index lets you retrieve records based on words in the title of
         the reference.  This index is organized as a word index, and will
         take all of the words in your search request and retrieve all
         records whose titles contain those words, regardless of their
         relative order.  For example, a reference with the title THE WIND IN
         THE WILLOWS would be retrieved by the request FIND TITLE WILLOWS WIND.
         ->
0      As you can see  from the above descriptions,  you search  indexes by using the
       FIND command.   You type the word FIND followed by the name of an index,  fol-
       lowed by a relational operator and a  value.   If you omit the operator,  then
       the equals (=)  operator is assumed.   It  is possible to join multiple search
       criteria with the logical connectors AND,  OR,   and AND NOT to construct com-
       pound requests,   and the  rules for doing  this are  described in  the Œ‡ƒ	Œ
       Œ„‰’ˆ „’ Ž„›’ˆ  manual.   SPIRES will perform your  search request and
       retrieve a collection of records known as  a search result.   For example,  to
       retrieve all records authored or edited by Don Knuth, you could type:
0        -> find author = knuth
         -Result: 1 REFERENCE
         ->
0      Similarly, to find all records with a topic value of 'test', you could type:
0        -> find topic = test
         -Result: 2 REFERENCES
         ->

0            Records are presented in the same format as they would appear with the DISPLAY
             command.   The TYPE command allows a number of useful options,  a few of which
             will be demonstrated here.   You can include a list of element names after the
             word TYPE to limit the display to only those elements.   Continuing our previ-
             ous example:
0              -> show result
               -Result: 2 REFERENCES

       SPIRES displays the reference elements in a  form known as the standard format
       when you include element names on the TYPE command.  Another option is to have
       the records displayed into  your active file by including the  words IN ACTIVE
       before the TYPE command.   Once the records  are in your active file,  you can
       type the PRINT command to get a quick printout.   A better way to get a nicely
       formatted printout of your records will be discussed later in this section.

0      One of the  advantages of storing bibliographic  records in a data  base is to
       provide some flexibility in the way records can be displayed.   The format set
       for your subfile allows  you to see records in an  approximation of either the
       standard APA or IEEE style.  To specify one of these styles, include the words
       USING APA or USING IEEE immediately in front of the TYPE (or DISPLAY) command,
       as shown in the following example:

0            Occasionally you  may want a  high-quality printout of  a selected set  of re-
             cords, possibly for inclusion in a paper or other document.   First,  obtain a
             search result (or stack) of desired records;  then,  sequence the selected re-
             cords in a  reasonable order and invoke  a special utility program  which will
             assist in preparing the records for printing.  The following sections describe
             the steps in this procedure.

0            To select  the records to  print,  retrieve the  records with an  index search
             (keeping in  mind that new  records will not be  retrieved until your  file is
             processed).  Owners of bibliographic subfiles often store a specific code word
             in the topic  element of each reference  for a particular paper  so that those
             records can be easily retrieved.   To retrieve all records in your subfile (if
             your file has been processed),  type  the EXTRACT command.   Other methods for
             gathering records involve the STACK command and the use of Global For process-
             ing techniques,  and are covered in  the Œ‡ƒ	Œ Œ„‰’ˆ „’ Ž„›’ˆ manual,
             available in Document Sales, Forsythe Hall.
0            Once you have a result or stack of  records to print,  sort them by typing the
             command SEQUENCE SORTKEY.  SORTKEY is a special element of your subfile called
             a virtual element whose only function is to sort records that are to be print-
             ed in the APA or IEEE style.   Records are sorted by author, then by date, and
             then by title.   If you want to know  the exact sorting rules used by SORTKEY,
             you can type SHOW ELEMENT DESC SORTKEY.   Alternatively, to sort records by ID
             number,  type SEQUENCE  ID.   Note that the SEQUENCE command  can handle about
             2000 records at most.  If you are over this limit, you must use a more compli-
             cated program called SPISORT  to do the sorting.   The SPISORT  program is de-
             scribed in  the Œ‡ƒ	Œ ‰’„ †“›š  manual,  available in  Document Sales,
             Forsythe Hall.
0            When you have completed the sorting process,  you will have an ordered collec-
             tion of records called a stack.   The last step is to invoke a special utility
             known as a SPIRES  protocol to prepare the sorted records  for printing.   Two
             protocols,  named PRINT.APA and PRINT.IEEE are  made available to you when you
             use your bibliographic subfile.   Select the one  you want by typing the name,
             preceded by two periods (for example,  ..PRINT.APA).   These protocols let you
             select various options to control the appearance of the printed output.

+      3.4.2   Using the PRINT.APA and PRINT.IEEE Protocols
+              _____ ___ _____ ___ ___ _____ ____ _________
0      The PRINT.APA and PRINT.IEEE  protocols are used to prepare a  sorted stack of
       bibliographic records for  printing.   Both protocols operate  in an identical
       fashion,  the only difference being the  style of output produced.   To invoke
       one of these protocols,  type two periods followed by the name of the protocol
       (i.e. ..PRINT.APA).  If you have not yet prepared a stack of records, the pro-
       tocol will remind you what you must do and will not allow you to proceed.
0      If a stack has  been properly prepared,  the protocol indicates  the number of
       records it will process, lists the current values of seven different print op-
       tion settings, displays a SETTING? prompt, and waits for a response.   At this
       prompt,  you can type  a question mark to see the  following list of available
       responses:
0        Type ? to see the names and values of current settings.
         Type GO to accept current settings and do the printing.
         Type a setting name for a description of that setting.
         Type a setting name followed by a value to change that setting.
         Type RESET to reset settings to their initial values.
         Press the BREAK key to cancel the entire print request.
0      The following  table provides  a description  of each  of the  seven available
       print option settings:
0      HEADER      The HEADER  setting controls which text  string will be used  as a
                   title header on the first page  of the printed bibliography.   The
                   header line will  be centered between the columns  defined as LEFT
                   and RIGHT by  the COLUMNS setting option.   The  default header is
                   'REFERENCES'.   If  you type  the word HEADER  followed by  a text
                   string,  then that string becomes the new header.   Note that your
                   new header value  may be in upper and lower  case characters.   If
                   you do not want a header line, then type HEADER NONE.
0      NUMBERS     The NUMBERS setting  controls the manner in  which references will
                   be numbered  in the output.    Three values are  recognized.   The
                   SEQUENTIAL value will cause references to be numbered sequentially
                   starting at 1,  and will place  a decimal point after each number.
                   The ID value will cause the ID number of each reference to be dis-
                   played,  enclosed in square brackets.    The UNNUMBERED value will
                   suppress the display of numbers for references.  The default is to
                   generate numbers sequentially.
0      EMPHASIS    The EMPHASIS setting controls the manner in which titles (and vol-
                   ume numbers)  will be emphasized in  the output.   Four values are
                   recognized.   The UNDERLINE  value will cause titles  to be under-
                   lined.  The ITALICS value will cause titles to be printed using an
                   italic character set.  The CAPS value will cause titles to be cap-
                   italized.   The NORMAL value will cause titles to be printed with-
                   out emphasis.  The default is to underline titles.   Note that the
                   ITALICS value can  only be used if  you print on the  3800 or 9700
                   printers,  and that a print option indicating two 12-pitch charac-
                   ter sets will be supplied automatically.

-            COLUMNS     The COLUMNS  setting controls the  alignment of each  reference on
                         the printed page.   The value consists of four numbers,  separated
                         by commas,  which  are interpreted in the  following manner:   The
                         first number (nstart) indicates the column in which the number for
                         a reference begins,  and must be in  the range from 1 to 21.   The
                         second number (start)   indicates the column in which  the body of
                         the reference begins, and must be in the range from 1 to 31.   The
                         third number (left) indicates the column to be used as a left mar-
                         gin for  subsequent lines of  the reference,   and must be  in the
                         range from 1 to 31.   The fourth number (right) indicates the col-
                         umn to be used as a right  margin for subsequent lines of the ref-
                         erence, and must be in the range from 40 to 120.  The default val-
                         ue (13,20,20,90)   is appropriate for  printing references  with a
                         12-pitch character set,  leaving one inch  margins on the left and
                         right sides of the page.   Note that if you adjust the column val-
                         ues for  printing at  10-pitch,  you  must also  adjust the  print
                         OPTION values to select appropriate 10-pitch character sets.
0            INCLUDE     The  INCLUDE setting  controls which  of  the annotation  elements
                         (ABSTRACT, COMMENTS and TOPICS)  should be included in the output.
                         To change  the setting you type  the word INCLUDE followed  by the
                         names of elements to include, separated by commas.  You may abbre-
                         viate any  element name to  three characters.   For  example,  you
                         could type INCLUDE ABS,TOP to include abstract and topics informa-
                         tion (and exclude comments).   The special values ALL and NONE can
                         be used to  include or exclude all annotation  elements.   The de-
                         fault is NONE.    Note that the text of the  ABSTRACT element will
                         appear after the main body of  the reference and will be reformat-
                         ted into  a single  paragraph,  and aligned  between the  left and
                         right margins as defined in the COLUMNS setting.   The text of the
                         COMMENTS element will appear next,   again formatted into a single
                         paragraph.  Finally the list of topic words will be presented on a
                         single line, separated by commas.  Note that it is possible to ar-
                         range for long sections of abstract  or comments text to be broken
                         into multiple paragraphs  by including null element  values at the
                         places in a record where you  want paragraph breaks (see Section 2
                         for details about entering null values).
0            AUTORUN     The AUTORUN setting controls whether or  not the print job created
                         by this  utility should be  automatically submitted when  you type
                         the GO command.  The default value is ON.   If you want the print-
                         ready dataset to be retained in your active file when this utility
                         completes,  then type AUTORUN OFF.   You  will then be able to in-
                         spect the dataset,  save it permanently if you wish,  and print it
                         explicitly with the PRINT command.
0            OPTIONS     The OPTIONS setting  allows you to override the  default print op-
                         tions that indicate which printer, forms,  and character sets will
                         be used  for the  output.   If  you do  not explicitly  change the
                         OPTIONS setting,  then  suitable print options will  be calculated
                         based on your  other selected settings.   If you  override the de-
                         fault, you must make sure that the options you specify are consis-
                         tant with your other settings.  For example, if EMPHASIS is set to
-                                                - 29 -

-                  ITALICS and you are overriding the default print options, then you
                   must specify  both a  normal and  an italic  character set  in the
                   CHARS option.   If you specify FORMS 1181 or 9511,  you must indi-
                   cate a character set valid for  the 3800 printer.   If you specify
                   FORMS BOND or  3HOL,  you must indicate a character  set valid for
                   the 9700 printer.   Also be aware that the default COLUMNS setting
                   values are  intended for  use with  a 12-pitch  character set  (12
                   characters per inch).
-      Following is an example that demonstrates  the complete process of retrieving,
       sequencing and printing a set of records:

-            You  should  be aware  that  the  printing  procedure,  described  above,   is
             considerably more expensive  than the standard procedure of  searching for and
             displaying records,  in  terms of CPU time.    If you are planning  to print a
             large bibliography,  you are advised to  run this procedure during the evening
             or on a weekend to minimize your costs.    Also,  if you are planning to print
             the same collection of records several times,   you can run the procedure with
             AUTORUN OFF and then save the resulting  print-ready dataset in a WYLBUR file.
             You can then print the bibliography at  any time using the PRINT FROM command,
             thus avoiding the expense of rerunning the print procedure.

0            If you know all of the settings you wish to use in requesting a printout,  you
             can avoid being prompted  for the information by including a  list of settings
             and values directly on the PRINT.APA  or PRINT.IEEE command.   The information
             you enter is the same as that supplied at the SETTING?  prompts,  and you must
             separate the individual  responses with backslash characters.    For instance,
             the previous example could have been entered on a single line in the following
             way:
0              -> ..print.apa header Bibliography\include topics\go
0              JOB 1814 BIBLIO AWAITING PRINT PRIO=9  POS=28 FORMS=BOND  LINES=22
               ->
0            If you make an error in one of your specifications, then the print utility ac-
             cepts all  valid specifications already received  and begins prompting  at the
             point that the error was detected.
0            As another  example,  suppose  you experiment  with different  combinations of
             print settings and  decide that you prefer a particular  combination that for-
             mats the  output for a  10-pitch character set.    The command for  doing this
             would be:
0              -> ..print.apa col 11,15,15,75\opt UNN CC FORMS=BOND CHARS=CU10\go

-            This section  describes the procedures for  creating a new  bibliographic data
             base and for customizing the definition of the data base to suit your particu-
             lar needs.  The customization procedures are necessary if you expect to extend
             the ability to add records and search  for records to other accounts.   All of
             the customization procedures discussed are general techniques that can be per-
             formed by the owner  of any SPIRES file,  and are discussed  in more detail in

0            If you  decide that  the bibliographic  system described  in this  document is
             suitable for your needs, you can type a single command to invoke a WYLBUR exec
             file utility  that asks questions  and creates a  private SPIRES data  base on
             your account.  This setup utility is self-explanatory, so let's run through an
             example and then  make additional comments.   To  create the data base  that I
             have been using for demonstration purposes in this document,  I typed the fol-
             lowing command:
0              > exec from lib#biblio public

0              This utility asks you a series of simple questions, and builds a SPIRES
               data base to hold bibliographic references based on your answers.  You
               should obtain a copy of the document titled "Managing Bibliographic
               References Using a SPIRES Data Base" before running this setup utility.
               This document can be purchased at Document Sales in Forsythe Hall, or
               printed by typing the command PRINT FROM DOC#BIBLIO PUBLIC.  To get out
               of this utility without building a data base, press the BREAK or ATTN
               key in response to any prompt.
0              This setup utility needs to use your active file as a temporary working
               area, but there is already something in it.  Please answer YES if it is
               safe to dispose of what is there or NO to return to WYLBUR where you
               can inspect and save the contents.

0              Please provide a subfile name for your SPIRES data base.  This is the
               name that you will use whenever you want to work with your data base.
               The name should be reasonably short but descriptive, and may be several

         different from other data bases that you already own.  Examples of
         subfile names are MEDREFS and SOLAR BIBLIO.
0        Subfile Name?  BIBLIO
0        Your subfile will be named BIBLIO
0        Is this the name you want (Yes/No)? YES
0        Do you want a special keywords index constructed for your data base?  If
         you answer YES, then an index will be built from individual words from
         the TITLE, TOPIC, NOTE, ABSTRACT, and COMMENTS elements of your file,
         allowing you to easily search for text words without having to remember
         the specific details of where they were stored.  If you plan to annotate
         your references by using the ABSTRACT and COMMENTS elements, and expect
         to perform frequent searches based on that information, then you should
         answer YES to create the index.  Otherwise, answer NO and your disk
         storage charges will be reduced by some modest ammount.  If you decide
         not to build the index now, you can always change your mind and build it
         later using some special procedures.
0        OK to build KEYWORDS index (Yes/No)? YES
0        Do you require that all topic words and phrases, used to categorize
         references by topic area, be predefined in a special topics table
         associated with your data base?  If you answer YES, then only topic
         words that have been predefined will be accepted when entering
         bibliographic records.  If you answer NO, then any words or phrases
         that are entered will be accepted as valid topics.
0        Require topics to be predefined (Yes/No)? YES
0        Would you like like a printed copy of the SPIRES file definition that
         is generated by this setup utility?  This printout provides a formal
         description of the structure of your bibliographic data base and is
         useful to have if you plan to do any further customization of your
         file, as described in the document for this system.  After answering
         this prompt, please wait for a few moments while your data base is
         being generated.

0        This setup utility has now completed its attempt to generate a
         bibliographic data base according to your specifications.  If all went
         well, you should be able to select your new SPIRES subfile and begin
         adding records by using one of the techniques described in the document
         titled "Managing Bibliographic References Using a SPIRES Data Base".

             This example demonstrated the complete process of creating a new bibliographic
             data base.    To begin the  creation process,   you type EXEC  FROM LIB#BIBLIO
             PUBLIC.   This  starts up a WYLBUR  exec file which  asks you to respond  to a
             short series of questions.   In my example,  I had some information in the ac-
             tive file when I began, and the utility first asked if it could erase that in-
             formation before proceeding.  The utility then asked for a subfile name, and I
             decided to  call my subfile  BIBLIO (thereby  causing BIBLIO CODES  and BIBLIO
             TOPICS subfiles to be generated as well).   After confirming the subfile name,
             I requested that a  KEYWORDS index be included in my  file,  and required that
             topic words  be predefined in  a table before they  can be used  to categorize
             references.   Finally, I asked for a printed copy of the file definition to be
             generated.
0            The setup  utility then compiled my  file definition,  creating a  new (empty)
             SPIRES file,   and displayed the  message '-File definition  compiled'.   This
             should be the only message that the  SPIRES compiler produces.   If error mes-
             sages appear at this point,  then you probably already have a SPIRES file with
             the same name  as the one you are  trying to create.   Run  the utility again,
             choosing a different subfile name.
0            When you have successfully  generated a file,  you can proceed  to select your
             new subfiles and try adding records, using the techniques described in Section
             2 of this document.   If you require topics  to be predefined,  then add a few
             topics to the topic table before adding bibliographic records.

0            The name you provide in the setup utility  is the name that you (or anyone you
             extend privileges to)  will use to access the bibliographic data base.   There
             are a number of  operations that the file owner may need  to perform which re-
             quire the manipulation of the file definition  itself.   To do this,  the file
             owner must  know the name of  the file (which is  not the same as  the subfile
             name).   The setup  utility constructs the file name by  joining with periods,
             your account,  the special word BIBLIO,  and the first seven characters of the
             first word of your subfile name.   In the setup example above,  if the account
             was GA.JSM, then the full name of the file would be GA.JSM.BIBLIO.BIBLIO.   If
             the subfile name was REFERENCES, the file name would be GA.JSM.BIBLIO.REFEREN,
             or if  the subfile  name was  MEDICAL ABSTRACTS  then the  file name  would be
             GA.JSM.BIBLIO.MEDICAL.   If you know the name of a subfile,  you can determine
             the file name in the following manner:
0              -> select biblio
               -> show eval $filename
               GA.JSM.BIBLIO.BIBLIO
               ->
0            Once you know the name of your SPIRES  file you can perform several useful op-
             erations, such as printing a copy of your file definition, modifying your file
             definition to allow other accounts to access your data base,  and erasing your

-      data  base when  you  no longer  need  it.   Before  you  customize your  file
       definition, it is recommended that you first print a copy of the original file
       definition for reference, as in the following example for account GA.JSM:
0        -> select filedef
         -> perform print ga.jsm.biblio.biblio

0      In Section 3,  the fact was mentioned  that newly added (or modified)  biblio-
       graphic records  cannot be retrieved by  searching indexes until your  file is
       processed.   Shortly after midnight each night, a program called SPIBILD auto-
       matically does  this processing by making  all recent additions  and modifica-
       tions permanent and bringing all indexes  up to date.   Occasionally,  a situ-
       ation may  arise where  it is  inconvenient to  wait for  overnight processing
       before retrieving new records.   In this case,  you can process the file your-
       self at the terminal,  as is demonstrated by the following example for account
       GA.JSM:
0        -> call spibild
         -Welcome to SPIBILD
         -? process ga.jsm.biblio.biblio
         -Passing:       2 records of record-type 01
         -Processed:     2 DEFQ records of record-type 01

         -Elapsed time:    2.840 seconds
         -Core usage: 0091/0484
         -?
0      In the above example, I first entered the SPIBILD processing environment,  and
       then typed the command  PROCESS followed by the name of  my bibliographic file
       (not the subfile name).   SPIBILD moved the new records into my data base, up-
       dated the indexes, and reported how much time and space was used.  If I wanted
       to, I could then return to SPIRES, select my subfile,  and perform the desired
       search.

0      In Section 2,  a procedure was described which let you collect the information
       for a single bibliographic record in your WYLBUR active file and then add that
       record to the data base with the USING ACTIVE ADD command.   It is also possi-
       ble to collect many  records in the active file and then have  them added in a
       single operation,  but the procedure  is somewhat different.   When collecting
       the records,  you  must make sure that  individual records are separated  by a

0            In the above example, I first prepared three records in the active file, sepa-
             rated by lines containing two backslash characters.  Then I got out of collect
             mode and entered the SPIBILD processing environment.  Before attempting to add
             the records,  I typed the command SET  EXCEPTION BADRECS (where BADRECS was an

-      arbitrary  ORVYL file  name  that I  chose).   This  command  is not  strictly
       necessary,  but provides a convenient way of isolating those records that fail
       to add due to errors, as we will see.  Finally I typed the BATCH command, fol-
       lowed by the name  of the bibliographic subfile.   The rest  of the lines from
       the example are messages from SPIBILD describing what happened.
0      SPIBILD first processed the file, and then started adding records.   The first
       record was added sucessfully and was assigned  an ID number of 4.   The second
       record had  an error,   and SPIBILD displayed  error messages  indicating that
       there was an invalid  value for the class element before line  8 of the active
       file.   The third record was added successfully  and was assigned an ID number
       of 5.   SPIBILD then displayed some  summary information indicating that three
       adds had been attempted, and that only two were successful.
0      The purpose of setting an exception file  was to enable SPIBILD to isolate all
       of the records that failed to add, and so we can continue the previous example
       in the following way:

         -?
0      To bring the records that had errors into the active file, I typed the command
       GET BADRECS CLEAR.   I then listed the active file, identified the error,  and
       used a WYLBUR editing command to fix the erroneous line.   After resetting the
       exception file and the format,  I typed  the BATCH command,  and the remaining
       record was added succesfully and was assigned an ID number of 6.  Since all my
       records had been sucessfully added,  I  erased the exception file (to minimize
       my disk storage charges).

-            A few concluding  remarks should be offered  here.   Some people who  use this
             method of entering records like to type  the command SET TERMINAL HEIGHT 0 be-
             fore they begin,  to avoid having to press  the RETURN key every time that the
             screen fills up with messages.   Adding  records in the manner described above
             also causes your file to be processed, so you can immediately CALL SPIRES, se-
             lect your subfile, and do index searches.  The cost of this method is slightly
             more expensive than entering a record at a time in SPIRES during the day,  but
             can be significantly less  expensive if you do it in the  evenings or on week-
             ends.   Also,  because the preparation of records is reduced to a text editing
             task,  a large bibliographic data base could be prepared on a microcomputer or
             word processor,  transferred to the IBM 3081 machine,  and entered in a single
             operation,  thus minimizing  the online connect charges for  building the data
             base.   Similarly, people wishing to move a bibliographic data base on another
             computer to the data base described in  this document should arrange to format
             their records in the manner described above, and then transfer them to the IBM
             3081,  either by a direct connection or via magnetic tape.   Those who wish to
             know more about SPIBILD and the BATCH  and PROCESS commands should consult the

+            4.3   CUSTOMIZING THE FILE DEFINITION
+                  ___________ ___ ____ __________
0            There are several  different ways in which  the owner of a  bibliographic file
             can customize the definition of that file.  The most common reason for custom-
             izing a file is  to extend to other accounts the ability to  add records or to
             search for and display records,  although  several other modifications are de-
             scribed as well.  Whenever a new SPIRES data base is defined, a special record
             describing the characteristics of the file is added to a system subfile called
             FILEDEF.   A section of that definition, called the subfile section, describes
             the privileges and restrictions associated with each subfile in the data base.

             nition.

-      To work with  the file definition,  select the FILEDEF  subfile,  TRANSFER the
       record for your file into the active file,  and use WYLBUR editing commands to
       list and  modify the definition.   When  you are satisfied with  the modifica-
       tions, use the UPDATE command to save the new definition.   You must then wait
       until the file is processed by SPIBILD (around midnight each night) before the
       changes take effect.   The following example  shows how to inspect the subfile
       section for the file defined earlier in this section:
0        -> set nolist
         -> select filedef
         -> transfer ga.jsm.biblio.biblio
         -> list 'SUBFILE'
            453.  SUBFILE-NAME = BIBLIO;
            465.  SUBFILE-NAME = BIBLIO CODES;

            455.    GOAL-RECORD = REC01;
            456.      ACCOUNTS = GA.JSM;
            457.        SECURE-SWITCHES = 1, 2;
            458.        NOSEARCH = 2;
            459.        SELECT-COMMAND = !SET NOECHO NOSTOP;
            460.        SELECT-COMMAND = SET COMPXEQ + BIBLIO PROTOCOLS;
            461.        SELECT-COMMAND = XEQ FROM BIBLIO.MESSAGE;
            462.        SELECT-COMMAND = SET FORMAT $BIBLIO;

            476.        FORMAT = $BIBLIO.TOPICS;
0      The subfile  section of  the file  definition is  divided into  three separate
       parts,  one for each subfile in the  file.   Each section contains a series of
       element name and value assignment statements,  and each statement must be ter-
       minated with a  semicolon.   By changing the  values of these elements  and by
       adding or removing various statements,  you  can change several of the charac-
       teristics of the subfiles.

0            The SUBFILE-NAME element defines the name that will be used in order to select
             a particular subfile.    The subfile-names from the example  above are BIBLIO,
             BIBLIO CODES,  and BIBLIO TOPICS.   You can  easily change the names of any of
             your subfiles by giving new values to these elements.   Note that SPIRES asso-
             ciates the  name of  a subfile with  the physical  description of  the subfile
             through the GOAL-RECORD element.   The goal  record called REC01 always refers
             to the main bibliographic record, REC02 is the journal codes table,  and REC03
             is the topics table.   If you change subfile-name values,  be sure to end your
             new value with semicolons,   and remember that after you type  UPDATE you will
             have to wait until the next day for the new names to be recognized.

0            The EXP element allows you to provide  a description of the contents and usage
             of any of your subfiles.   Typically, each value is a single line of text end-
             ing with a semicolon,   and there may be multiple lines  for each defined sub-
             file.   Any  account that has  permission to access  one of your  subfiles and
             knows the subfile name,   can type EXPLAIN SF followed by  the subfile name to
             read the explanation that you have provided.    If you are planning to allow a
             large number of accounts  to access your subfile,  take care  to write a clear
             and helpful subfile explanation.   Note  that simple default explanations have
             already been provided.

0            In the setup procedure to build your data  base,  you are asked if you require
             topics to be predefined  in a topics table before being  used in bibliographic
             records.  If you answer YES to this question, the element assignment statement
             'SECURE-SWITCHES = 1,2;'  is placed into the subfile section  for your biblio-
             graphic subfile (see line 457 of the above example).   If you subsequently de-
             cide that you do not want the restriction,   you can remove this line from the
             subfile section.   Alternatively, if you decide that you want the restriction,
             you can insert this line into the subfile section.

+                    ________ _______ _________ ________
0            The subfile section of your bibliographic subfile has a sequence of assignment
             statements for an element called SELECT-COMMAND.  These lines contain commands
             that are  automatically executed whenever  you select your  bibliographic sub-
             file.   The line that  we will discuss here is the  one containing the command
             SET FORMAT $BIBLIO.   This line sets the format that provides all of the func-
             tions described in Section 2 of this document.  In Section 2, you learned that

-      the ADD and MERGE commands allow you to  be prompted at the terminal to add or
       modify bibliographic records,  and you also learned that you can control which
       elements are presented with the SET FORMAT * command.   If you want a specific
       set of elements to  be included for ADD or MERGE prompting  when you first se-
       lect your subfile,   modify the SELECT-COMMAND line in the  subfile section to
       include an element selection specification (see  Section 2.1.4).   As an exam-
       ple,  suppose you expect to enter references to articles and expect to provide
       topic words and lines of abstract text.  You could modify the line of the file
       definition as follows:

            462.   SELECT-COMMAND = SET FORMAT $BIBLIO;

+      4.3.5   Giving Full Privileges to Other Accounts
+              ______ ____ __________ __ _____ ________
0      Within each of the three subfile sections  is an element called ACCOUNTS which
       lists the accounts that have been given  full privileges for using the associ-
       ated subfile.  Accounts with full privileges may add, modify, search for, dis-
       play,  and remove records in a subfile.    The bibliographic data base is ini-
       tially created so that only the owner of the file has full privileges, and you
       should always keep  the owner's account number  as a value of  these elements.
       You may  extend full privileges  for any of your  three subfiles to  other ac-
       counts by appending additional account numbers,   separated by commas,  to the
       existing account.   For example,  if you wanted  to let both GA.XXX and GA.YYY
       add bibliographic records,  but  only let GA.XXX add new topics  to the table,
       you could modify the file definition as follows:
0        -> modify 456 475
            456.      ACCOUNTS = GA.JSM;
            Mods >                     r, ga.xxx, ga.yyy;
            475.      ACCOUNTS = GA.JSM, ga.xxx, ga.yyy;
            Mods >
            475.      ACCOUNTS = GA.JSM;
            Mods >                     r, ga.xxx;
            475.      ACCOUNTS = GA.JSM, ga.xxx;
            Mods >

       the active file, and you must type UPDATE and then wait until the next day for
       the changes to become effective.

+                    ______ __________ __________ __ _____ ________
0            A data base  owner may wish to give  certain accounts the ability  to select a
             subfile and search for and display  records without allowing those accounts to
             add or modify records.  To do this, the file owner must first create an exten-
             sion to the subfile  section,  and then must include the  list of accounts and
             the statement that imposes the restriction into this new section.   Adding the
             statement,  'SECURE-SWITCHES = 3;' to the  new section will keep accounts from
             changing the contents of  records.   If the list of accounts  that you plan to
             enter is very long,  you may find some advantage in using one of the following
             special forms of the account:
0            GG....      This form would represent all accounts in group GG.
0            G.....      This form would  represent all accounts whose group  begins with G
                         (like GA, GX, and GG).
0            PUBLIC      This form represents every account on the machine.
0            As an example, suppose you want to modify your file definition to allow anyone
             to search and display records in  your subfile.   The following commands would
             perform the necessary modifications:
0              -> copy 455/464 to 464.1
               Line 464.55 is the last line.

0      Now the subfile section for BIBLIO has two separate parts; the first part giv-
       ing the file owner full file privileges,   and the second part allowing anyone
       else to search (but not alter)  the file.   You can expand upon this procedure
       and create even more account sections, and customize each account section in a
       different way.
0      The standard  format $BIBLIO normally  displays records  at the terminal  in a
       line by line format, and requires you to add the words USING APA or USING IEEE
       to the DISPLAY or TYPE commands to see records in a different style.  Two oth-
       er formats,  $BIBLIO.APA and $BIBLIO.IEEE,  are also available and provide the
       same functions  as $BIBLIO;  the only  difference being that they  display re-
       cords,  by default,  in APA or IEEE  styles respectively.   If either of these
       formats is set,  you can still see the line by line form of records by includ-
       ing the words USING PLAIN before the DISPLAY or TYPE command.   As an example,
       suppose you want to arrange it so that accounts who search (but not alter) the
       file automatically see records in APA format.  In the above example, you could
       do this with the following modification:
0        -> modify 464.45
            464.45      SELECT-COMMAND = SET FORMAT $BIBLIO;
            Mods>                                          i.APA
            464.45      SELECT-COMMAND = SET FORMAT $BIBLIO.APA;
            Mods>
         ->
-      As a final modification to the newly created account section, you could insert
       two special  statements which would  hide all  values of the  COMMENTS element
       from public view,  but  still allow the file owner to  add and display private
       comments in bibliographic records.   To include this additional restriction in
       the example, you would type the following:
0        -> insert 464.26 464.27
         464.26 >  constraint = 1;
         464.27 >  noupdate = 1;

+                    _____ ________ __ ___ _______ _______
0            In the  subfile section of  your bibliographic subfile  there are a  number of
             SELECT-COMMAND assignment statements.  These statements contain commands which
             are executed automatically whenever you select your bibliographic subfile,  to
             establish the processing environment as described  in this document.   The se-
             lect-commands in the example definition are the following:
0              -> list 459/463
                  459.        SELECT-COMMAND = !SET NOECHO NOSTOP;
                  460.        SELECT-COMMAND = SET COMPXEQ + BIBLIO PROTOCOLS;
                  461.        SELECT-COMMAND = XEQ FROM BIBLIO.MESSAGE;
                  462.        SELECT-COMMAND = SET FORMAT $BIBLIO;
                  463.        SELECT-COMMAND = SET STOP;
               ->
0            The first and last  commands ensure that the environment will  be properly es-
             tablished,  even if you accidentally press the BREAK key.   The second command
             gives you access to the special print protocols described in Section 3 of this
             document.   The third command provides a way for the designer of this applica-
             tion to  notify file owners  of any future  enhancements to the  system.   The
             fourth command sets the main format for  the data base and has been previously
             described.
0            As a final comment and caution,  you are  advised not to attempt to change any
             parts of the file definition other than the subfile sections.  The formats and
             protocols expect record elements to be named  and organized in a specific man-
             ner,  and changing  the file definition may cause these  utilities to function
             improperly.   If  you are seriously considering  a change in the  structure of
             your file, you should see a SPIRES consultant for advice.
