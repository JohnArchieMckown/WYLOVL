Title:  Bessel's Interpolation with Equally Spaced Points

Library Program Number:  C017

Subprogram name(s):  BESSL1

Summary:  Given a table of values of a function F(x) at a set of
equally spaced values of x, this procedure uses Bessel's
interpolation formula to determine the value of F(x) for any value
of x in the range (see &LLABEL in the parameter list).

Field of application:  Mathematics

Search key:  Bessel, Interpolation, Equal

Languages from which this routine may be called:  FORTRAN IV;

Parameters:

     Parameter     Type                   Description

       XI       real variable        the initial value of the
                short precision      independent variable x

      XF        real variable        the final value of the
                short precision      independent variable x

       H        real variable        the x increment
                short precision

       Y        real array           a one-dimensional array
                short precision      containing the know values of
                                     the dependent variable.
                                     Y[I] = F(XI + I X H).
                                     (Minimum array bound = 1.)

       X        real variable        the value of the independent
                short precision      variable for which the
                                     interpolation takes place

     EPS        real variable        a tolerance parameter (e.t.
                short precision      .000001, see References)

       M        full word integer    the maximum number of
                                     differences to be taken

      IB        real variable        the interpolated value, F(X)
                short precision

    &nnn        statement number     a statement to which control
                                     is transferred if X is outside
                                     the allowable range which is
                                     [XI, XF].

Note:  The array Y is changed by the procedure.
