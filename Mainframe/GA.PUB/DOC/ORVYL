*12/15/90  New SHOW VFILES command added

A new command, SHOW VFILES has been added that will show file
attaches.  The syntax of the command is:

         SHOW VFILES [MILTEN-lineno] [LIKE filename] [ADDR]

ADDR is probably of limited interest...  it gives the control block
addresses.

If you just type "SHOW VFILES" you will get all the file enqueues.
You may also get the message:

      (Queue changed; backing up a bit...)

mixed in with the other messages.  It means that something changed
while the command was formatting information from the enqueue
control blocks.  It's harmless (but you will get the last couple of
lines repeated).  A command that only displays a few lines is far
less likely to get this message (e.g., SHOW VFILES LIKE
ORV.GG.SPI.PROGLIB).

The format of the response is:

    Line nnnn GG.UUU has file XXX
or....
    Line nnnn GG.UUU is waiting for file XXX

the options "(Shared)" or "(Exclusive)" are shown at the end of this
line.


*08/29/90  Minor Extension to Debugging Commands

The programmer debugging commands such as "SC" (SHOW CORE) and "ST"
(SET TRAP) allow symbol names to be specified.  However,
interprets symbols which begin with $, @ and # specially.  If you
have a program which has symbols that begin with these characters
you can now type two of these characters.  For example:

      > sc $$REF

will show core at the address of the symbol "$REF".

The change was made to make it easier to use/debug the  C
runtime routines which use symbols which begin with special
characters.


*07/01/90 SHOW VINFO Command Extended

The SHOW VINFO command will now display more information about file
system and paging I/O rates.  This can be used by technical users to
determine the overall system activity level.  SHOW VINFO is an
internal command, and is subject to change without notice, but it is
not privileged.


*07/01/90  New SHOW VVERSION Command Added

A new SHOW VVERSION command has been added to report the time/date
of the last  installation along with a brief message about what
was changed.  This is analogous to WYLBUR's SHOW WVERSION command
and 's SHOW MVERSION command.
