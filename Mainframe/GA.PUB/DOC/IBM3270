This document is meant to be printed on the IBM 3800 printer in
Forsythe Hall rather than read online.  However, if you are looking
for specific information, reading a few lines on the screen may be
satisfactory.  Printing on other than the IBM 3800 printer may
require adjustments to the PRINT command.  You may need to delete
the OPTIONS: line and add options suitable for your printer.  To
print from the IBM 3800, type the PRINT 1/LAST command.

0            This document describes  how to use an  IBM 3270 type terminal  with the
             system at Forsythe,   especially with Page WYLBUR.   It  assumes a basic
             knowledge of the system, and of Page WYLBUR in particular.  In addition,
             it assumes  a basic familiarity with  the particular 3270  type terminal
             you are using.
0            For more information  on the 3270 type terminals,  see  the IBM terminal
             manual for your particular terminal.    For information on the Entry As-
             sist program  mentioned later see the  IBM document Entry  Assist User's

0            1.1   THE IBM 3270 TERMINAL

+                  ___ ___ ____ ________
0            For the purpose  of this document,  the expression "3270"  refers to the
             entire class of IBM 327x and 317x terminals.  It also applies to person-
             al computers emulating 3270 terminals.  If you have a personal computer,
             however, you may find it easier to use the Samson program.   Samson is a
             terminal emulation and file transfer program especially tailored to work
             with WYLBUR.
0            The 3270 terminals are intrinsically different from ASCII terminals, the
             other major class of terminals supported under Page WYLBUR.  The differ-
             ences between terminal classes are most notable when using Page WYLBUR.
0            ASCII terminals are connected to the IBM 3084 mainframe at Forsythe Hall
             through front ends,  mini-computers  that themselves process information
             about the  terminals and  translate it into  terms that  the application
             program understands.
0            The 3270 type terminals, however, are connected to the mainframe through
             an IBM terminal controller.   Each controller may have several terminals
             connected to it.  The controller performs local editing functions on the
             terminal.   These terminals are not connected  to the same kind of front
             ends,  so they do  not have all the flexibility of  ASCII terminals con-
             nected to the system through the ASCII front ends.
0            For more information on the 3270 terminals,  see the IBM terminal user's
             manuals.

+                            2.  USING THE 3270 WITH LINE MODE WYLBUR
0            The 3270 terminal is a buffered terminal;   it stores your data and then
             transmits it  only when you  press the ENTER  key or a  Program Function
             ("PF") key.  Note that the ENTER key is not the same as the carriage re-
+                                                    not
             turn key on most keyboards.   In Line mode, the terminal buffer is large
             enough to hold one full line of WYLBUR text (235 characters).
0            When you type a command in line mode, the command will wrap as you reach
             the edge of the screen.   You may backspace to make corrections anywhere
             in the command.   The backspace does  not erase the characters you back-
             space over (it is not a  destructive backspace).   Everything in the un-
             protected area (the command  area)  is sent as a command  when you press
             the ENTER key, regardless of the cursor position.
0            There are three ways to send an  "Attention" (or BREAK,  on other termi-
             nals).
0                The "Program Attention" keys PA1, PA2, and PA3 act as an attention,
                  without actually sending any data to the computer.
0                The  "Program Function"  keys PF1  through PF24  send an  attention
                  while also transmitting the data on the line.  This is the only way
                  to send the command retry signal @ BREAK.
0                The "ATTN" key  always acts as an attention.   This  is the slowest
                  method as it  requires WYLBUR or MILTEN to send  extra control mes-
                  sages.  Use this method when the keyboard is locked.
0            When listing information at the terminal, the prompt "MORE" appears when
             there is more data than will fit on the screen.  There are four possible
             responses to this prompt.
0                Pressing ENTER in  response to the prompt continues  the listing at
                  the top of the screen.
0                Pressing "CLEAR" clears the screen and continues the listing at the
                  top of the screen.
0                An attention,  by any of the  methods listed above,  terminates the
                  listing and displays the command prompt.
0                Typing a  command at the prompt  and pressing ENTER  will terminate
                  the listing and execute the command.
0            Because the  3270 terminals  have their own  page pause  mechanism,  you
             should not use the WYLBUR SET  TERMINAL HEIGHT=n command with these ter-
             minals.
0            The "CLEAR" key in any other context clears the screen.

0            WYLBUR can  guess which type  of terminal you are  using when you  use a
             3270 type terminal, so you do not usually have to give the "SET TERMINAL
             type" command before using Page mode.  However, if you are using a color
             terminal and want to make use of  the color attributes,  you should type
             the command:
0                 SET TERMINAL 3279
0            to the command prompt.
0            Use the VIEW command to enter Page mode.   The Page mode screen will ap-
             pear.  At the very top of the screen is WYLBUR's information area, which
             tells you  where the  file is from,   if it was  taken from  a permanent
             WYLBUR file, how many lines are in the file, and whether or not the file
             has changed  since you  last saved it.    If you  give the  command VIEW
             UNNUMBERED,  it tells you what lines are  on the screen.   If you scroll
             the page horizontally, it tells you which columns are on the screen.  It
             also tells you if any text has been marked.
0            The "Command:" prompt marks the WYLBUR  command line.   You may give any
             WYLBUR command from this command line.    Underneath the command line is
             WYLBUR's message area.  This is where WYLBUR displays the system messag-
             es while you are in Page mode.  For example, if you have a message wait-
             ing, a status message in this area will tell you of it.
0            The column line displays the margins and tabs set by WYLBUR.   Note that
             the column line does not display the margins and tabs set on your termi-
             nal; section 3.5 covers changing margins and tabs.
0            Beneath the column line is a text area.  This may be 20 or 28 lines, de-
             pending on the terminal type your are using.   The lines may be numbered
             or unnumbered, depending on your VIEW command.   The area underneath the
             solid horizontal line  below the the text  area is a status  area.   IBM
             calls this  area the "Operator  Information Area".   This  area displays
             terminal status  indicators;  their function is  a part of  the terminal
             hardware, not WYLBUR.   For detailed information on the status messages,
             see your terminal's user's manual.

             3270; see section 3.5 for turning on word wrap.  The 3270 will automati-
             cally move text  to the next line when  you reach the right  edge of the
             screen or of the margin you have set  on your terminal,  but it does not
             automatically keep words together.

             Correct mistakes as  you go by backspacing and typing  over them.   Note
             that the backspace  is not destructive;  it does not  actually erase the
+                                   not
             character you backspace  over.   The only exception to this  is when you
             are in Insert mode and in Document mode at the same time.
0            To type over existing text,  move the cursor to the desired location and
             type.
0            The Delete Character key on the 3270 will delete a single character.
0            The HOME key will move the cursor to  the command line at the top of the
             screen.

0            The 3270 terminals do not have the ESCAPE, CONTROL, or DELETE keys which
             are central to the Page WYLBUR sequences.   Instead, it has numeric Pro-
             gram Function (PF) keys and other special keys.  You can use most of the
             Page mode ESCAPE functions using the PF11  key which has been defined as
             the ESCAPE key.   Most of the CONTROL and DELETE key sequences have been
             assigned to various function (PF) keys.

+                  _____ _____ ______ _________
0            Most of  the common  editing functions are  represented by  the function
             keys described above.  There are many others, however, some of which are
             available on the 3270.  In particular, you may use many of the Page mode
             ESCAPE key sequences, which handle text scrolling, alignment,  and edit-
             ing.   The ESCAPE sequences available on the  3270 are all listed in Ap-
             pendix A, "Page WYLBUR Escape Functions".
0            There are two methods of using the ESCAPE sequences.  One way is to move
             the cursor to the command line using  the HOME key.   Then type a period
             (.)  followed by the letter that would normally follow the ESCAPE key in
             the desired ESCAPE sequence.   Press the  ENTER key to send the sequence
             to WYLBUR.
0            For example, to see the last page of the file you could use the HOME key
             to move to the command line, type ".e" (without the quotation marks) and
             press the ENTER key.   This would scroll  to the last page (the end)  of
             the active file.
0            However, many ESCAPE sequences depend on the position of the cursor when
             you give the command.  For example, the command to align text (ESCAPE A)
             aligns the  text starting at  the cursor  position until the  next blank
             line.   If you give the command from  the Command line,  WYLBUR does not
             know where to align the text.
0            In these cases, it is best to use an alternative method.  Press the PF11
             key (ALT - if your PF keys are not labelled) from the desired cursor po-
             sition.   This moves the cursor to the  command line and prompts you for
             the letter or symbol for the sequence you want (in this case, "a").   It

-            automatically includes the  preliminary period (.)  for  you.   Type the
             letter or symbol and press the ENTER key.  Your cursor then automatical-
             ly returns to the original location and WYLBUR executes the command.

+                  _____ ___ ____  _____ ______
0            Most 3270  terminals have a  special mode  for entering text  called DOC
             mode, or Entry Assist.   This is actually a feature of the terminal con-
             troller.  Doc mode provides the capability to word wrap, set margins and
             tab stops, and use other useful functions.   If you plan to do much text
             editing on your terminal,  it is  quite useful.   For information on the
             DOC mode, see the IBM publication GA23-0119-0, IBM 3270 Information Dis-

0            To enter DOC mode,  hold down the ALT key while pressing the CHG FMT (or
             F3)  key on left side of the  keyboard.   The message DOC will appear in
             the status area at the bottom of the screen,  followed by a downward ar-
             row which indicates that word wrap is on.
0            The word wrap feature only works in DOC mode.  Before it works, however,
             you must first set the margins on your terminal.   Press the CHG FMT (or
             F3)  key on the keyboard when you are in DOC mode and a column line will
             appear in the status area at the bottom.   (On some terminal models like
             the 3290,  the column line appears at the cursor and may be moved verti-
             cally with  the cursor movement keys.)    Move the shadow cursor  on the
             column line using the cursor keys.   Press the CHG FMT (or F3) key again
             to make the column line disappear.
0            For word wrap to work in Page mode you must set the terminal's right and
             left margins to match those on the Page mode screen.  Move the cursor to
             the desired location.   Type a less-than symbol (<) to set the left mar-
             gin and a greater than symbol (>)  to set the right margin.   If you are
             viewing unnumbered text, then the left margin must be set at position 0.
             If you are seeing the text with the line numbers, set the left margin at
             column 11.
0            The word wrap feature  works best when you are entering  text at the end
             of a file (when the lines being wrapped to are blank).  When inserting a
             large block of new  text in the middle of existing text,   it is best to
             use the COLLECT  function to open up a  few new lines,  and  to keep the
             next line always blank.
0            You can also set  tabs and margin bells on this  column line.   Remember
             that these  are tabs set on  your terminal;  WYLBUR knows  nothing about
             these tabs.   All  of these margin and tab settings  are permanent until
             you change  them again or until  the Terminal controller unit  is turned
             off.
0            Once in DOC mode,  you can move the cursor by words instead of by single
             spaces.   Hold down the ALT key and  press the cursor arrow right key to
             move to the next word (word next  function).   Hold down the ALT key and
             press the cursor arrow left key to move to the previous word.

             DOC mode  also gives you  the capacity to delete  an entire word  at one
             time.   Hold down the ALT key and  press the delete character key (often
             symbolized by an  "a" with a scratching through it).    This will delete
             from the current cursor position to the beginning of the next word.   If
             the cursor was originally located at the start of a word, it will delete
             the entire word.

             3.6   USING INSERT MODE
+            3.6   USING INSERT MODE
+                  _____ ______ ____
0            To get into Insert mode, press the Insert key on your terminal.   A sym-
             bol will appear  in the bottom status  area to indicate that  you are in
             insert mode.   To turn off Insert mode, press the RESET key on your ter-
             minal.  It also turns off when you press the ENTER key.
0            If you are not in Doc mode and try to insert text into an existing line,
             you will get an error symbol in your bottom status area and the keyboard
             will lock.   This happens because the  terminal will only insert text if
             there are trailing null  spaces on the line (empty spaces)   to move the
             text into.   Normally,  any empty space at the end of the line is inter-
             preted as blanks,  not as null spaces,  so your terminal thinks that the
             line is already full.  If the text in the line already reaches the right
             margin, this will also happen.
0            To get around this problem without going into DOC mode,  use the PREPARE
             function key, PF12, after turning on insert mode.   A plus sign (+) will
             appear in left margin of the current line.  The PREPARE function changes
             any blanks at the end of the line to null spaces, so that you can insert
             as many characters into that line as there are spaces between the end of
             the text and the right margin.   The PF12  key is a toggle key;  use the
             same key to turn off the PREPARE function.
0            If you are both  in DOC mode and Insert mode,  then  you can insert text
             into an existing line  and it will automatically wrap to  the next line.
             The backspace key  actually erases the characters you  backspace over in
             this situation as well;  this is the  only situation in which a destruc-
             tive backspace is possible.
0            In either case,  you cannot insert empty lines by pressing the ENTER key
             while in Insert  mode,  because the ENTER key actually  turns off Insert
             mode.  Instead, use the COLLECT key, PF1, to open new lines.
0            Remember that the  word wrap function does  not work very well  when you
             insert several  lines of text into  existing text,  because it  does not
             open up new lines and does not  always wrap effectively to existing text
             lines.   If you want to insert several  lines of text into the middle of
             existing text,  it is best to open  up several empty lines first,  using
             the COLLECT function (PF1).
