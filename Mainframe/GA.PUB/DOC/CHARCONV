                              CHARCONV

CHARCONV is designed to convert a card deck that has been keypunched
on a 026 punch (BCD code) to the EBCDIC code used on the Data Center
mainframe.  The IBM 029 and 129 key punches use EBCDIC.  It will be
necessary to run this program if you intend to modify your deck
either with WYLBUR or keypunch, as all of our keypunches are 129.
In most cases it is advisable to convert the source code to 029
punch (EBCDIC) if you want to make modifications later and have
forgotten that the source is 026 punch (BCD).  If the deck is not to
be modified, except for the addition of JCL, it may not be necessary
to convert the deck, as most processors provide an option for
reading 026 punch.  To determine if the compiler you plan to use has
such a feature, check the appropriate manuals for that processor
(e.g., the WATFIV manual or FORTRAN programmer's guide).

We recommend that you not punch a new deck, but use the CHARCONV
program to transfer your deck to a WYLBUR file at the same time it
is being converted.  However, both options, (disk file or punched
deck), are demonstrated below.

 Outputting Converted Deck to Disk:

   //  JOB  statement
   /*PASSWORD  password <-- (omit this line if job is submitted from
   //  EXEC  CHARCONV        WYLBUR rather than the original punched
                             cards)
   //FT07F001  DD  DSN=WYL.gg.uuu.rest.of.name,
   //  UNIT=DISK,DISP=(,CATLG),
   //  SPACE=(80,(ncards,ext),RLSE),DCB=CARD
   <--- your deck here

where:

   password      your password
   ncards        is the estimated number of cards in your deck.
   ext           should be about 10% of ncards.  This is a
                 secondary in case ncards has been underestimated.
   gg.uuu        is your account number.
   rest.of.name  is the name you want the file to be known by from
                 WYLBUR.  It must conform to the usual conventions
                 for data set names.

 Punching A New Deck:

   //  JOB
   /*PASSWORD password
   /*JOBPARM  CARDS=ncards
   //  EXEC  CHARCONV
   <--- your deck here


NOTE:  WYLBUR users may type UTIL CHARCONV to convert the active
file.
