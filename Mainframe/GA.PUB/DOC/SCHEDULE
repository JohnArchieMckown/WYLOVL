                          NOTES

 ** Jobs on the 4090 are separated by pink 3HOL paper trailer sheets
    which contain the job name and total job charge.

 ** The 4090 does not require separate setups for simplex and duplex
    printing of 3HOL forms, and it has multiple input trays.
    Therefore there are no longer separate time blocks for BOND, 3HOL
    simplex, and 3HOL duplex.

 ** There is a 200,000 line limit on jobs printed between 6:00 AM
    and 6:00 PM Monday through Friday.  Requests to print jobs
    exceeding 200,000 lines during this time period must be
    coordinated with Production Services, 723-2701.

 ** Turnaround time is 60 minutes (from the time a job is off the
    printer until it is binned) for the 4090 printer.


 ** GBAR or 3LAN form designation will print on the Xerox 4090 in
    'landscape' mode.  With either code, output will be print on 3hol
    paper in landscape orientation.  A 13.6 or 15 pitch character
    set will be used, depending on line length, so output of up
    to 150 columns can be printed.  You can SET OUTPUT FORMS=GBAR
    or FORMS=3LAN to have all your batch and WYLBUR PRINT output
    that doesn't specify a form code printed in this way.

    Forms=GBAR will print with gray bars that simulate the effect of the
    blue bars on form 1181.  The gray bars are a "forms flash", and only
    one flash may be used at a time.  If you specify a FLASH option with
    GBAR, your flash will be used instead of the gray bars.

    The default for GBAR and 3LAN output is duplex mode:  output is
    printed on both sides of the paper, except that the first page of
    each individual output data set or data set copy is always printed on
    the front side of the paper.  Single-sided GBAR or 3LAN output can be
    obtained by specifying DUPLEX=NO in JCL or by using the NODUPLEX
    option on the Wylbur PRINT command.

    The system treats GBAR and 3LAN forms output the same as forms 3HOL
    when scheduling output on the printer.  On the system status display
    the GBAR and 3LAN output will be included in the 3HOL print backlog
    statistics.  The accounting records for GBAR and 3LAN printing will
    show a forms code of 3HOL.


*Impact Printer

AVR labels are available on the impact printer at the following
times:  5:00 and 11:00 AM; 5:00 and 11:00 PM.

*Microfiche (COM) Delivery Schedule

Computer output microfiche (COM) jobs entered in the SYSOUT=M (fiche)
output queue by 1:00 AM will arrive in your bin by 8:00 AM.  Jobs
entered between 1:00 AM and 6:00 AM will arrive in your bin by 2:30
PM.  There are currently no pick-ups during the day except by
special arrangement with Production Control, 723-2701.

*Disk Backup

The public disk volumes are backed up to tape on Saturday through
Tuesday between  12:00 midnight and 6:00 AM.  The backup schedule
can be obtained online by using the dataset WYL.GW.DSK.BACKUP.SCHEDULE.
The UTIL RECOVER command can be used to submit a request for the
restoration of individual files.

Please note that these backups will backup undeleted Wylbur mail and
that these mail items may be available on backup tapes for as long
as seven months.

*ORVYL File System Maintenance

ORVYL file system maintenance is performed daily starting at
approximately 4:00 AM. (3:30 AM on Monday) and ending at
approximately 5:30 AM.  Portions of the ORVYL file systems are
available in a READ-ONLY mode during these maintenance operations.

When an ORVYL file system is in READ-ONLY mode, users will be unable
to update or add to their files.  When an attempt is made to use an
ORVYL file while ORVYL is in READ-ONLY mode, the users will receive
a variation of the following message:

      'FILE MAINTENANCE IN PROGRESS'

and they will be unable to proceed with any further updating.

The primary use of the maintenance time is to copy (to backup) file
system data on tape.  Two types of backups are done.  a Full-File
backup is done once a week for each file system; all data in the
file system is copied to tape.  An Incremental backup is done each
day for each file system; only data which has changed since the last
Full-File backup is copied to tape.

Please note that all EMS mail, whether deleted or not, will be backup
up for at least 13 days and perhaps for as long as three months.

Below is a list of the ORVYL file systems schedule for a Full-File
backup to tape.

       File System              Full File Backup
                                  is Done on

        OOD                     Monday morning
        ITS                     Tuesday morning
        Folio/Socrates          Wednesday morning
        FIS                     Thursday morning
        GENERAL                 Friday morning
        SDCACCT                 Saturday morning
        NSI                     Sunday morning

[The Hospital mainframe Orvyl file system Full-File backup is done
on Monday morning, causing us to begin the maintenance process at
3:30 am.]

Contact Operations Technical Support at 725-2194 for restoration of individual
ORVYL files.

All ORVYL file systems can be identified by using the 'SHOW VBLOCKS'
command.

Individual ORVYL files can be identified by using the 'SHOW FILE'
command.
