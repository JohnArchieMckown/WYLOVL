WHAT IS SAMSON?

Samson is a computer program that allows you to:

      * use an HP TouchScreen Personal Computer as
        a terminal connected to the IBM 3084 at ITS

      * transfer files between an HP TouchScreen
        Personal Computer and the IBM 3084 at ITS.

Samson is available on 3-1/2 inch double-sided micro-floppy disks in
single-sided format.  Samson works on an HP TouchScreen with two 3-1/2 inch
micro-floppy disks or with one micro-floppy and one hard disk.

Although Samson is easy to use, we assume that you have worked on an HP
TouchScreen Personal Computer and are familiar with its P.A.M.  (Personal
Applications Manger) or with MS-DOS before you read this and try to use
Samson.  This guide covers the basics to begin using Samson.  The Samson
Users Guide provides a more detailed description of the program.

The following documents will introduce you to the IBM 3084 system:

Accounting Information for the 3081, How to LOGON and LOGOFF, the ITS Rate
Schedule, and the WYLBUR Overview.  All are available in Document Sales,
Forsythe Hall.  For online help, type HELP in response to the Command> prompt
on the 3084.

INSTALLING SAMSON

Before you use Samson for the first time, you must install it on your HP
TouchScreen.  The installation procedure consists of loading MS-DOS from your
HP diskette and then copying and possibly customizing Samson.  The procedure
varies according to whether you have an HP TouchScreen with a hard disk and a
floppy disk or a system with two floppy disks.

Installation Procedure for a Hard Disk
If your HP TouchScreen has one floppy disk and one hard disk, it is
recommended that you install Samson on the hard disk and save your Samson
master disk.

Use the "Install" program on the HP-supplied disk labelled "HP TouchScreen
Application Master Disc" Following the instructions for the Install program,
install the programs labelled "Samson V2.1" and "Term V2.1" onto your hard
disk.  For information on the Install program, see the HP TouchScreen
Personal Computer Owners Guide.

Installation Procedure for a Dual Floppy System
If your HP TouchScreen has a dual floppy disk system, it is recommended that
you make a copy of Samson along with MS-DOS on a disk and save your Samson
master diskette.

Before you do this you must format a blank disk.  For instructions on the
Format program, see the HP TouchScreen Personal Computer Owners Guide.
Choose the "Copy System" option in the Format program to copy MS-DOS to the
formatted disk.

Once you have formatted the blank disk, use the Install program provided on
the HP-supplied disk "HP TouchScreen Application Master Disk" to install both
Samson and the MS-DOS commands.  After touching "Install" and "Start Applic"
on your P.A.M.  screen, remove the application master disk and put in the
HP-supplied System Master disk.  Following the instructions for the Install
program, install the program "MS-DOS Commands".

Once you have installed the MS-DOS commands, replace the System Master disk
with your Samson master diskette.  Use the Install program to install the
programs labelled "Samson V2.1" and "Term V2.1" onto the formatted disk.

Save the Samson master diskette for later copies and use the new disk you
copied Samson to as your work diskette.

LOGGING ON TO THE IBM 3084

To use your HP TouchScreen as a terminal connected to the 3084, you must
logon to the 3084 by establishing a connection and entering your ITS account
and password.

The following procedure assumes that the Samson diskette is in disk drive A
and that you have turned on the HP.  The examples in this document assume
that you are using Samson from the MS-DOS prompt.

  A> samson <-- The program is loaded.

  Samson Version 2.1 is ready for work.
  Copyright 1984, 1985 Stanford University.

  A> term <-- HP is ready to connect as a terminal.

  [You are now in terminal mode.  Typing SHIFT-STOP
  gets you out.]

  Turn on Gandalf or modem, or dial-in to Stanford.
  Press the Return key.

  enter class <-- Type 20 and press Return
  class 20 start <-- The system responds:

  Connecting to port 11A-DH0.02
  Welcome to the Stanford Data Center (SYSA), Forsythe Hall

  Account?  nr.car <-- Type your ITS account.
  Password?  <-- Type your password.
  Command> set terminal HP150PC <-- Define terminal type

Once you have logged on, you can use the HP TouchScreen as a terminal
connected to the IBM 3084 and transfer files between the two systems.

Samson allows you to move easily between the HP TouchScreen and the IBM 3084
system:

  Command> micro <-- Return to MS-DOS
  A> term <-- Return to 3084

When your work on the IBM 3084 is finished, type LOGOFF to disconnect from
the 3084.  Disconnect or turn off your modem, or turn off your Gandalf.  Then
you can turn off your HP TouchScreen or return to MS-DOS or P.A.M..  If you
return to the HP TouchScreen without typing the LOGOFF command, you are still
connected to the 3084.

TRANSFERRING FILES

HP TouchScreen --> 3084

Once you have loaded Samson and logged on to the 3084 system, you can
transfer a file from your HP TouchScreen to the IBM 3084 with a USE command:

  Command> use b:mail.txt <- Copies file MAIL.TXT from drive B to active
                             file on IBM 3084.

To print the file you have just transferred to your active file:

  Command> print <- Prints active file (MAIL.TXT) on IBM 3800 printer.
                    The 3084 responds:

  JOB 208 CARNR199 AWAITING PRINT ...

To save the file you have just transferred to your active file, you must
issue a SAVE command.

  Command> save pcmail  <-- Saves active file (MAIL.TXT) on IBM 3084
                            in a file named PCMAIL.
  PCMAIL saved on PUB002

  Command> <- You can continue on the 3084 or type MICRO to return
              to the HP.

3084 --> HP Touchscreen

Once you have loaded Samson and logged on to the 3084 system, you can
transfer a file from the IBM 3084 to the HP with a SAVE command.

  Command> save b:mail.txt <- Transfers a copy of text in active file
           to MAIL.TXT file on drive B.

  MAIL.TXT saved on B <- 3084 tells you that the file is saved.

  Command> <- You can continue on the 3084 or type MICRO to return
              to the HP.

WARNING:  Files created by spreadsheet or word processing may require special
handling when transferred between systems.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:  Use the TRANSPARENT option on the USE and SAVE
commands when transferring a file to another micro via the 3084.  This keeps
WYLBUR from translating the text as it sends and receives it.

CUSTOMIZING SAMSON

When you type SAMSON to load the Samson program, Samson automatically
executes the commands in a file called SAMSON.SAM.  This file includes
commands establishing communications parameters.  You can modify this file
for your own needs, or create a new file ending with .SAM (NEWFILE.SAM, for
example), which you use with the command SAMSON NEWFILE when you load SAMSON.

The following commands may be put in a .SAM file to customize Samson.


SET PORT {COM1|COM2} - Tells Samson which port on the HP to use.

SET SPEED {300|1200|2400|4800|9600} - Sets transmission speed.

CONNECT - Connects with modem.

DISCONNECT - Disconnects from modem.

SEND 'text' - Sends text to 3084.

RECEIVE 'text' - Waits until text is received from 3084 or smart modem.

WRITE 'text' - Displays text on HP screen.

WRITELN 'text' - Displays text on HP screen generates a new line.

WAIT n - Pauses for n seconds.

SET ANSWERBACK 'string' - Makes your HP respond to a terminal inquiry prompt
with the specified string.

SET {TRACE|NOTRACE} - TRACE:  displays commands on the screen as they are
executed.  NOTRACE:  does not display commands.

SET TRANSFER HEX - Transfers data over networks that do not accept full
eight-bit sequences (Telenet and multiplexor lines).

SET PARITY {7E|7O|7S|7M|7N|8N} - Sets terminal parity to seven bits even,
odd, space, mark, or none, or eight bits none.  7E is the default.

SET PRINTER PARITY {7E|7O|7S|7M|7N|8N} - Sets the parity of the printer port.

;any text - Adds a comment to document your file.

PRINTING AND LOGGING YOUR SESSION

Printing your Screen - The F2 key on your keyboard is a PRINT SCREEN key.
When you press this key it sends a copy of the contents of your screen to the
printer attached to your HP.

Printing your Session - The F3 key on your keyboard is a PRINT SESSION key.
When you press this key, Samson starts sending a copy of your terminal
session to the printer attached to your HP.  It will stop when you press
the F3 key again or when you return to MICRO mode.

Sending your Screen to a File
- The F6 key on your keyboard is the FILE SCREEN key.  When you press this
key, Samson sends a copy of your screen image to a file on your HP called
SESSION.LOG.

Logging your Session to a File - The F7 key on your keyboard is the FILE
SESSION key.  When you press this key, Samson starts sending a copy of your
terminal session to a file called SESSION.LOG on your HP.  If you already
have a SESSION.LOG file, Samson adds the new information to the end of the
existing file.  The logging stops when you press the F7 key again, or when
you return to MICRO mode.

Changing the default log file - If you want to send your screen image or
session log to a file other than SESSION.LOG, use the SET LOGFILE 'name'
command to tell Samson the new log file name.  Include this command in
your .SAM file

THE HP TOUCHSCREEN KEYBOARD
