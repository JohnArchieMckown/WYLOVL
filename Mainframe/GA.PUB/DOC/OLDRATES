                            1 block = 2 kilobytes)

           DATA ACCESS AND PREPARATION SERVICES (ADAPT)

As a special rate for ADAPT (After-hours Data Access and Preparation
of Text) services available to Stanford funded accounts, terminal
sessions in OTHER time blocks are charged a flat $1.00 per hour
which replaces the usual processing charge.  This $1.00 rate applies
only to sessions at real terminals, not virtual terminal sessions
nor printing.  The $1.00 per hour rate is also available to Stanford
University faculty, staff, and students for their personal accounts.

                     LOW COST BATCH COMPUTING

If you need large amounts of batch CPU, you may be able to run for
less in Class L.  Available during OTHER blocks only, the rate for
Class L CPU time is $0.13 per second, with a $30.00 minimum.  Refer
to "Using Class L", available in Document Sales, Forsythe Hall, for
instructions.

                             PRIORITY

Rates for batch CPU and for the printers are affected by the
priority at which you request the job to be run or printed.  URGENT
priority is 2.0 times the STANDARD rates.

                      ARCHIVE TAPE STORAGE

For any tape that has not been read or written on for 400 days.
There is a transfer fee of $5.00 when a tape is sent to storage plus
a $1.00 per month storage charge; there is no charge to return a
tape from storage.  Tapes brought from storage to Forsythe Hall and
left at Forsythe Hall are charged at the regular rate.  Refer to
"Archive Tape Storage," available at Document Sales, Forsythe Hall.

                          ACCOUNT DETAIL

A resource billing detail, summarizing all charges against an ITS
account, will be sent to the account user for a monthly fee of
$1.00.
