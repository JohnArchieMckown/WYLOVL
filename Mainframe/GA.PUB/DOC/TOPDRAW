The default Versatec paper is fan-fold (PLTFORM=FOLD);
continuous-roll paper is mounted at intervals.  See DOC#SCHEDULE
PUBLIC for the current schedule.  If you want continuous-roll paper,
you must specify PLTFORM=ROLL on the EXEC statement, e.g.,

   //  EXEC  TOPDRAW,PLTFORM=ROLL

in addition to specifying the CONTINUOUS option on the SET DEVICE
command.

Since Class Q no longer exists, you should ignore all references to
Class Q.
