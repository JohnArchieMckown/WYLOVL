 This is WYL.GA.PUB.DOC#ABACUS ON CATLG at CAMPUS.

 ABACUS was originally written by Len Shustek of the SLAC Computation
 Research Group as a multi-user MILTEN subsystem.  He later modified
 ABACUS to run under ORVYL.  This documentation describes the "ORVYL"
 version of ABACUS (which is the only version available at Campus).

                      *              *

                      ****************









      ABACUS is a simple interactive expression evaluator
 available under ORVYL.  To invoke ABACUS, simply type:

                   CALL ABACUS


      The prompt for ABACUS is a colon (:) to distinguish it from
 the normal WYLBUR prompt (?).  The response to a colon prompt may
 be an expression or a command.  What follows is a brief
 explanation-by-example of the expressions; the full syntax is
 included as an appendix.



1
 (1)  SIMPLE EXPRESSIONS
+     __________________


     FORTRAN-like arithmetic expressions may be entered
 directly.  More then one may be entered on a single line.

          : 2+2
          4

          : 1+3*sin(.34)
          2.0004613

          : exp(50.5)/2   atan(.34)
          4.2740671E+21  0.32773851


 The following elements may be used in such expressions:

      a) Decimal constants:   2  2.2  -2.2e-4

      b) Hex constants (constants with leading zeroes and no
         decimal point):    01c43e   0a   012   0413a469b0
         If the number of digits after the zero is less than 9,
         it is interpreted as a right-adjusted fixed-point
         integer.  If there are 9 or more digits after the zero,
         it is interpreted as a left-adjusted floating-point
         number.

      c) Functions (most FORTRAN functions are available):
             sin(0.46)    sqrt(abs(log(.5)-1))
         (You can also define functions; see section 6)

      d) Variables (8 characters or less)
         Two variables are predefined:  PI  and  E

      e) Operators.  The following list is in increasing order of
         operator strength:

              + -   binary (2-operand) addition and subtraction
              * /   binary multiplication and division
              **    exponentiation
              + -   unary (prefix) plus and minus
              !     factorial  n!=gamma(n+1)

      f) Parentheses may be used wherever needed to override
         the operator precedence rules.
           2*(a+b)    (n+1)!


      All expressions are evaluated using double-precision
 floating point arithmetic.  Operations which involve only
 integers and integer functions are computed to more precision
 than integer arithmetic would allow (at least 53 bits) and no
 low-bit errors will occur.  Results are printed in what ABACUS
 deems to be a 'reasonable' format depending on the value; in
 particular, integers are printed as such.



1
 (2)  ASSIGNMENT EXPRESSIONS
+     ______________________


     Variables are created by assigning them a value.

          : x=sin(pi/3)
          0.8660254

     Since assignments are expressions, they may be used as part
 of larger expressions.

          : sqrt(y=exp(3.4))
          5.4739474

     Undefined variables are prompted for when their value is
 needed.  Any expresssion can be used to define them.

          : log2(bignum)
          UNDEFINED VAR
          BIGNUM: 2**8
          8



 (3)  PSEUDO-VARIABLES and PSEUD0-FUNCTIONS
+     ________________     ________________


      INPUT (abbreviated INP), OUTPUT (abbreviated OUT), and OUTNL
 are functions that can be used to input and output values to the
 terminal.  These are useful primarily in looping statements and
 functions.

      The argument of INPUT should be one or more variable names,
 whose values will be requested at the terminal.  The argument of
 OUTPUT or OUTNL should be one or more variables or expressions,
 whose values will be written to the terminal.  OUTPUT writes the
 values but does not necessarily go to the next line; OUTNL forces
 a new line to begin after the values are written.  OUTNL is
 particularly useful in conjunction with FOR-loops for printing
 tables.  OUTNL can also be used without arguments to force a new
 line.

      The value of these pseudo-functions is the value of the last
 argument.

      : input(a)**2                : 1+output(a,3*4)
      a: 3                         a=3  12  13
      9

      INPUT, OUTPUT, and OUTNL can also be used as
 pseudo-variables, that is, without an argument list.  Whenever
 INPUT is used in an expression, a new value will be requested
 from the terminal; whenever OUTPUT or OUTNL is assigned a value,
 that value will be written to the terminal.

      There is a special variable named AC whose value is always
 the last number written to the terminal.

1
 (4)  LOOPING EXPRESSIONS
+     ___________________


    (A) FOR Loops

           An "Algol-style" FOR-TO-BY loop can be used.  The body
     can be a single expression or multiple expressions enclosed
     in DO...END.

          : s=0; for i=1 to 10 s=s+i
          0  55

          : for x=0 to 10 by .5  do y=x**2  s=s+y end
          772.5
          : y
          100

          The initial value and the increment are assumed to be 1
     if omitted.  If the terminating value is omitted, the loop
     continues until the attention key is pressed or an error is
     encountered.

          The "value" of these expressions (the result printed
     automatically) is the last expression evaluated in the body.
     Often, however, other results will be stored in variables or
     printed from within the loop by the OUTPUT pseudo-function
     or pseudo-variable.

        : for i outnl(i,exp(i))
        I=1  2.7182818
        I=2  7.3890561
        I=3  20.085537
        I=4  54.598150
        I=...                     (ATTN pressed)
        ABORTED


    (B) LOOP...REPEAT

        A sequence of statements enclosed between LOOP and REPEAT
        will be executed repeatedly until one of the following
        occurs:

          1.  An embedded  WHILE logical-expression  is false
          2.  An embedded  UNTIL logical-expression  is true
          3.  The ATTN key is pressed
          4.  An error occurs

          : loop out=sin(inp) repeat
          INPUT: 1
          0.84147098
          INPUT: pi/2
          1
          INPUT: ***      (ATTN pressed)
          ABORTED
1
          : loop inp(x); while x>0; out(sqrt(x)) repeat
          X: 100
          10
          X: 10
          3.1622777
          X: 0
          0         (returns last expression evaluated and stops)


      The logical-expression used for WHILE, UNTIL, and (see next
 section) IF-THEN-ELSE can be any combination of arithmetic
 expressions with the relational operators LT, LE, GT, GE, NE, EQ
 (or < <= > >= ~= ) and the logical operators NOT, AND, OR.  The
 semicolons used to separate expressions in the example are
 optional.




 (5) IF-THEN-ELSE
+    ____________


       The IF-THEN-ELSE construction is a conditional
 expression; its value is the THEN expression if the
 condition is true, and the ELSE expression otherwise.  If
 the ELSE is omitted, the value is 0 if the condition is
 false.

   : loop output = if inp(x)<0 then sin(x) else 1-cos(x) repeat
   X: 1
   0.45969769
   X: -1
   -0.84147098
   X: ***         (ATTN pressed)

      The THEN and ELSE expressions are not limited to simple
 arithmetic; they can be any of the complex expression types
 available, or a list of expressions enclosed in DO ...  END.


1
 (6) DEFINING FUNCTIONS
+    ________ _________


      Functions may be defined (or re-defined) with the DEFINE
 command.  Those functions may then be used wherever a built-in
 function may be used.

    : define hyp(a,b)=sqrt(a**2+b**2)

    : define sumsq(x) = sum=sum+x**2 ; outnl(x**2)

    : def f(x) = if x le 1 then 1 else x*f(x-1)

    : def table = for i outnl(i,exp(i))

      Functions may be defined to have zero or more formal
 arguments, which are local to the body of the function.
 Functions may be called recursively.  Functions defined with the
 same name as a built-in functions will supercede the latter until
 erased.  The body of a function may be a single expression or
 multiple expressions separated by semicolons; the maximum length
 is 160 characters.  The value of the function is the last
 expression evaluated.

      The single-line restriction for functions is occasionally
 inconvenient, and a facility for multi-line functions may
 eventually be added.  In the meantime, complicated functions may
 be constructed by "chaining", that is, by having functions call
 other functions as the last expression.




 (6A) MODIFYING FUNCTIONS
+     _________ _________


      The "modify" command allows modifications to be made to an
 existing function without entirely retyping it.  The function is
 displayed and can be modified in the same way as the WYLBUR
 modify command for lines of the active file.

       : mod hyp
               HYP(A,B) = SQRT(A**2+B**2)
       ALTERS?                     r-
               HYP(A,B) = SQRT(A**2-B**2)
       ALTERS?
       :


1
 (6B) SAVING AND RESTORING FUNCTIONS
+     ______ ___ _________ _________


      Functions which have been defined can be saved in a file for
 later use.  In the ORVYL version of ABACUS, the PUT and GET
 commands transfer functions between ABACUS internal storage and
 ORVYL files.  Note that, unlike the ORVYL commands of the same
 name, the active file does not participate in the transfer.  In
 both cases the syntax of the commands is much like those of ORVYL.


   ABACUS under ORVYL examples:

       : put chebyshev
       : get tri.diagonal user mhw gro cg


 Notes:

     ∑  The operand "nolist" on the "get" command
        prevents the functions from being listed as they are
        read.

     ∑  If you attempt to save a dataset, member, or file which
        already exists, it will prompt with "OK TO REPLACE?".
        You may anticipate the question and add 'rep' to the
        command.

     ∑  ORVYL files are (currently) saved in PRINT format.

     ∑  In addition to function definitions, files that are
        loaded may contain any valid ABACUS commands (except
        another "get" or "put" command).  You may
        create such files from ORVYL.  (ORVYL files should be
        saved in PRINT format.)

                          bytes in memory beginning at 'address'.
                          'length' must be 1, 2, 3, or 4, and is
                          assumed to be 4 if omitted.

                        COMMANDS
+                       ________


     Commands may be entered at any time.  If the prompt is for
 a variable, the same prompt will be re-issued after the
 command has been executed.


 A.  "SET" Commands
+    ______________


  set degrees         Change to degrees for trig functions.
                      (default is radians)

  set radians         Use radians for trig functions.

  set digits n        Display numbers with n significant digits.
                      (2<n<16)
+                       _ _

  set hexadecimal     Display results in hex.  This doesn't affect
                      input; hex numbers are still entered with
                      a leading zero.

  set decimal         Return to decimal output.

  set fuzz xxx        Set the relative tolerance for floating
                      point comparisons to xxx.  The initial fuzz
                      is 1.E-14.

  set mode retry      In "retry" mode, the previous command or
                      expression will be listed to allow
                      modification when an error occurs, or when
                      a null line (just a carriage return) is
                      entered (see Note 3).

  set mode noretry    In "noretry" mode, the previous command or
                      expression will be listed for modification

                      user-defined.

  show ufcts          Display only user-defined functions.

  show mode           Show whether "mode retry" or "mode noretry"
                      is in effect.



 C.  Other Commands
+    ______________


    modify xxx          Display function xxx and allow it to be
                        changed.  The modifications are entered
                        exactly as if the Wylbur "modify" command
                        had been given for a line of the active
                        file.  See Note 3.


    erase var1 var2...  Erase the listed variables.  (This is
                        useful if the variable table has
                        overflowed.  The current limit is 25
                        variables.)

    erase fct1 fct2...  Erase the listed user-defined functions.
                        (This is useful if you are getting "no
                        more room" or "stack overflow" error
                        messages.)


    suggest text...     Send a suggestion.  (About ABACUS,
                        presumably.  Comments, complaints, etc.
                        are most welcome.)

    to xxx text...      (Same as regular TO command)

    wylbur              Return to WYLBUR.

    wylbur xxx          Execute xxx as a
                        WYLBUR or ORVYL or MILTEN command, then
                        return to ABACUS.

    @xxx                An abbreviation for
                        "WYLBUR xxx".


    exit                Terminate ABACUS and
                        return to ORVYL immediately.  All
                        function definitions and defined variable
                        will disappear.



1


  Notes about commands:


 1. Any unrecognized SHOW or SET commands are sent to WYLBUR.

 2. Most long keywords can be abbreviated by their first three
    or more letters.

 3. Wylbur-like modifications (in response to the prompt "ALTERS? "
    may be used in the following circumstances:

    A)  After a "modify <fctname>" command
    B)  After appending "@<ATTN>" to the end of an input line
    C)  By entering "@<ATTN>" as an input line (the previous
        command or expression will be listed for modification)
    D)  By entering a null line (just a carriage return) in
        "retry" mode.
    E)  After an error has occured in "retry" mode.

    All the Wylbur editing characters are allowed (r,d,i,l,n, and
    b) except "^<ATTN>" and "$<ATTN>".

    Prompts for alteration will continue until either:

    A) A null response (just a carriage return) in which case
       the function will be re-defined or the command re-executed.
    B) <ATTN> as the only input.  The function will be unchanged
       or the command will not be re-executed.
