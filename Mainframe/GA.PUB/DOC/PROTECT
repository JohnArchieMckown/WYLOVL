       DATA ACCESS AND SECURITY AT THE STANFORD DATA CENTER
                       USING THE RACF SYSTEM

WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT DATA ACCESS AND SECURITY WHEN USING
STANFORD DATA CENTER COMPUTERS?

Depending on the kind of work you will be doing, you may need to
protect your data so that other users can have access or others may
need to change their data protection to allow access for you.  The
Stanford Data Center currently supports four different data security
systems.

SPIRES, ORVYL and Prism all use the same security system.  That system
supports both element and full dataset security and is described in
the SPIRES File Definition documentation (#58).  Start by reading
about those topics listed under "security" in the index.  This same
documentation can be viewed online by typing "explain security" once
within the SPIRES environment (e.g. after a CALL SPIRES command has
been issued).

Tape security is handled by the Tape Library Management System (TLMS).
Documentation on tape protection is found in the Batch Processing
document (#240).  Read sections 6.5.2 and 9.3.2 for details.

CICS comes with its own security support subsystem.  CICS is currently
only used by administrative users at the Hospital.

All remaining disk access and security is handled by IBM's Resource
Access Control Facility (RACF).  The remainder of this document
explains how to use RACF to provide protection for all batch, WYLBUR
and VSAM datasets.  Batch and WYLBUR datasets are those disk datasets
that begin with names like WYL. or SYSn.  VSAM datasets begin with
names like Vxxx.  (e.g. VSAM., VAIS., etc.)

WHAT IS THE MINIMUM I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT RACF?

RACF is an IBM-licensed access and security system used on the Data
Center's IBM ES9000 computer located in Forsythe Hall.

As new datasets are created, they will be protected by your account
default unless overridden by a more specific profile which you can
create.  Your account default can be changed by issuing the SET
PROTECT DEFAULT command.  Type HELP SET PROTECT DEFAULT for further
information.  Type SHOW PROTECT DEFAULT to see your current default
settings.

For many users, this may be all you need to know about the RACF
security system.  However, as you need to expand the way in which one
or more of your datasets is protected or as you find that the same
group of accounts need common access to your datasets, you will need
to know more about RACF.  The remainder of this document answers all
of the common questions that you will have as your security needs
expand.

HOW DO I CREATE MY OWN PROFILES?

Use the SET PROTECT command to create/modify profile information.

Use the SHOW PROTECT command to see information about one or more
profiles.  The ALL option lists all profiles and associated datasets.
The WITH DSN option lets you see a single profile and the datasets
which are protected by it.

Use the RACF command for all group related activities including
creating a new group, connecting a user to the group, disconnecting
a user, deleting a group or listing a group.

Type HELP SET PROTECT or HELP SHOW PROTECT or HELP RACF for additional
details on these commands.

See examples 1 through 9 at the end of this document.

WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF RACF PROTECTION?

At the present time, only disk dataset resources (non-ORVYL/SPIRES)
are protected by RACF.

All members of a library (partitioned dataset) are protected according
to the protection of the whole library.  At the present time it is
not possible to provide different protection for different members of
the same library.

RACF can protect other types of resources including datasets on
tape, terminals, CICS transactions, application programs, entire
applications, and user-defined resources.  With the exception of
tape protection, it is not currently planned that RACF will protect
any of these other types of resources at Stanford.

HOW DOES RACF PROTECT DATASETS?

RACF provides access to the system and access to datasets by means
of profiles.  User, dataset and group profiles work together to
provide the necessary access and security.

WHAT IS A USER PROFILE?

A RACF user profile contains information that is automatically
created for RACF when a new Stanford Data Center account is opened.
This profile, defined by the account code (gg$uuu), has two purposes.
First, it controls access to the system and second, it controls access
to RACF protected datasets.  In addition to these control functions,
the user profile also houses other general usage information and
statistics.

WHAT IS A GROUP PROFILE AND HOW DO I CREATE ONE?

A RACF group profile provides an easy way to limit access to common
data shared by a group of Stanford Data Center accounts.  The group
owner names the group and connects or disconnects accounts to the
group on an as-needed basis as people come and go or as projects
begin and end.

By using group names rather than individual accounts when creating or
maintaining dataset permits, the access lists (which tells RACF which
accounts/groups have access to which resources) are much shorter and
easier to maintain.

A group must have a system-wide unique name of up to eight
characters.  Group names are reserved on a first-come first-served
basis by issuing the RACF ADDGROUP command.  You will be notified
within 24 hours that the name you pick is available for use in
SET PROTECT commands.

All accounting groups (e.g. all the 'gg' groups) exist and may be
freely used.  All users belong to one of these groups.  Thus,
account AB.CDE belongs to accounting group AB.  In addition there
are reserved groups for ADMIN, INTERNAL, RLIN, SYSTEMS and some
others.


HOW DO I ADD OR REMOVE PEOPLE FROM AN EXISTING GROUP?


The RACF command is used to accomplish all group related activities
including adding and removing people (user-ids or account ids) from
groups.  If you are the owner of a group you can display the
membership of the group and you can delete the group.  Type HELP
RACF for a more full description of these capabilities.

WHAT IS A DATASET PROFILE?

A RACF dataset profile defines which groups or users have access to
the datasets protected by the profile and what level of access they
have.  This combination of group/user and level of access is called
an "access rule."  A single profile can have multiple access rules
in effect simultaneously.

Each profile also has a logging level associated with it and a
recipient of any log records that are generated.  To set the logging
level and the recipient account, the LOG and NOTIFY options need to
be specified on the SET PROTECT command.

A single dataset profile may protect an unlimited number of datasets
including ones that have not yet been created.  For example, a dataset
profile may be pre-established so that a newly created dataset that
matches the profile entry will be protected when it is created at some
future time.


WHAT HAPPENS IF I CREATE A DATASET THAT HAS NO MATCHING PROFILE?

Newly created data sets will always be protected by a profile.  If
no other profile protects it, then the default for your account will
always protect it.  To see what your current default is, issue the
command SHOW PROTECT DEFAULT.  To see which profile is currently
protecting a given data set, issue the command SHOW PROTECT dsname.
Note that the dsname doesn't actually have to exist in order to see
how it would be protected when it is created.

CAN I CHANGE MY ACCOUNT DEFAULT?

Yes.  Issue the command SET PROTECT DEFAULT {access-rule} to change
your default.  Be aware that all datasets protected by your former
default will now be protected by the new default.  Dataset protection
is dynamic!   Note also that while it is possible to delete other
profiles, your default profile can't be deleted.

Your default profile can have multiple access rules in effect
simultaneously.  Each new access rule must be added with a new SET
PROTECT DEFAULT command.  They may be removed using the REMOVE
option.  To see your current default protection issue the command
SHOW PROTECT DEFAULT.  To see how all your datasets are protected
issue the command SHOW PROTECT ALL.

Issue the command HELP SET PROTECT ACCESS-RULE for a list of the the
various access rule options.

See example 1 and warning 1 for examples of using the SET PROTECT
DEFAULT command.

HOW DOES RACF ALLOW A SINGLE PROFILE TO PROTECT MORE THAN ONE DATASET?

Because a profile name may include wildcards, or variables, any
number of datasets may match a given profile name.  A "%" wildcard
allows for single character substitution (e.g. ARCHIVE.YEAR%%).  An
"*" wildcard allows for multiple character substitution within a
single level.  An "*" wildcard must be the last character within a
level.  Thus, ABC* is acceptable, but A*BC is not.  If the "*"
appears at the end of the profile name, it can represent multiple
levels (e.g. WYL.gg.uuu.TEST* will protect datasets named TEST,
TESTA, TEST.DAY1, TEST.DAY1.INPUT, etc.)

DOES RACF REQUIRE ME TO NAME MY DATASETS ACCORDING TO THE WAY I WANT
THEM PROTECTED?

No.  However, the more structure you can build into your naming
scheme, the fewer RACF profiles you will need to manage.  There are
many reasons for naming datasets, and dataset security is only one of
those reasons.  For example, your LIB dataset is a special dataset
that should never be renamed simply to accommodate simpler security
profiles.

WHAT IF A DATASET IS PROTECTED BY MORE THAN ONE PROFILE?

RACF will not let this happen.  It will always pick the most specific
dataset profile.  For example, suppose you have the following three
profiles:

   WYL.gg.uuu.*
   WYL.gg.uuu.ABC.*
   WYL.gg.uuu.*.XYZ

Dataset WYL.gg.uuu.ABC.XYZ will be protected using the second profile.
This profile is the more specific one because the wildcard is the
final qualifier.

WHAT ARE ACCESS LEVELS?

Associated with each dataset profile is the level of access that each
group/user has.  The valid levels are NONE, READ, UPDATE, CONTROL and
ALTER.  NONE obviously allows no access.  READ allows designated
users to read (list or use) the information in the dataset(s).  In
addition, if a user knows the password to an account he/she can write
(save) or scratch any dataset to which READ access has been granted.
UPDATE allows users to write new data into an existing dataset but
does not allow the dataset to be renamed or scratched.  No password
is needed with UPDATE access.  CONTROL only applies to VSAM related
profiles where access to the control portion of the dataset is
needed.  (e.g. IDCAMS VERIFY option.)  ALTER allows all of the above
and enables users to rename and scratch matching datasets.

The dataset owner always has ALTER access.

HOW DO I CREATE A DATASET PROFILE?

You may create dataset profiles by using the WYLBUR SET PROTECT
command.  For further information type HELP SET PROTECT.   Also, see
examples 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 at the end of this document.

WHY WOULD I WANT TO LOG ACCESSES TO MY DATA?

By default, accounts with "sensitive" data log all failed attempts
to access their data.  Accounts with "sensitive" data are those
accounts that have their passwords automatically changed each month
or that have double password protection.

Other good uses for logging are to find out if a dataset is still
being used, or how often it is being used, or at what times of the
day or month, or which accounts are accessing the data.  You can
turn the logging on and off as desired using the SET PROTECT with
the LOG and NOTIFY options.

HOW DO I REMOVE A PROFILE THAT IS NO LONGER NEEDED?

There are two ways.  The first way is automatic (unless overridden).
If the profile is fully qualified (i.e. no wildcards), then the
profile will go away when the matching dataset is scratched.  To
prevent this from happening, scratch the dataset using the RETAIN
option on the SCRATCH command.

The second way is to manually remove the profile by issuing the
command SET PROTECT profilename DELETE.

A good way to see if you have profiles that are no longer needed
is to issue the SHOW PROTECT ALL command.  All profiles will be listed
and those without any matching datasets will be so indicated.  Those
are then candidates for removal.  However, just because there are
no matching datasets does not necessarily mean the profile should go
away.  Some profiles exist so that they will protect datasets created
sometime in the future and those datasets may exist for awhile and
then go away. This is especially true in a production environment.

WHICH ACCESS DOES RACF USE IF MORE THAN ONE ACCESS RULE APPLIES?

If a user belongs to more than one group and these groups have
different accesses to the same dataset, then the group with the least
restrictive rule will be used to provide access.  However, if there
is an access rule for a specific user, that rule will always take
priority over any group rule.  Thus, suppose that account GG.ABC is a
member of groups GG and TEST and that the following access rules
apply for some profile:

    GROUP    GG      READ
    GROUP    TEST    UPDATE
    ACCOUNT  GG.ABC  NONE

Account GG.ABC will have no access to datasets covered by the
profile.  If the last access rule is removed, then account GG.ABC
will have UPDATE access (since UPDATE is less restrictive than READ).

HOW CAN I SEE HOW ALL OF MY DATASETS ARE CURRENTLY PROTECTED?

Issue the command SHOW PROTECT ALL.  Not only will you see which
profile protects each of your datasets, but you will see the level
of access logging and which account receives those log records.

HOW CAN I SEE HOW A SINGLE DATASET IS PROTECTED?

Issue the command SHOW PROTECT dsname. Note that dsname need not
actually exist.

I'M USED TO THE OLD SECURITY SYSTEM.  HOW IS RACF DIFFERENT?

RACF added many additional capabilities that the previous system
did not have.  There were very few "non-transparencies" at the time of
the cutover to RACF.  The major differences were that the older
system protected each dataset individually.  When a dataset was
scratched, so was its protection.  RACF uses profiles which can
protect groups of datasets and when the datasets are scratched, the
profiles remain (except when the profile is fully qualified and is
scratched without the RETAIN option).  Second, RACF expanded the concept
of protecting datasets by groups.  The old system did not allow a user
to create a new group.  RACF does allow this.

For more details on the differences, please USE and read the
documentation in DOC#RACFCONV PUBLIC.


MY QUESTION HAS NOT BEEN ANSWERED YET.  WHERE CAN I GET ADDITIONAL
HELP?

This document has attempted to answer most common questions about
RACF, but RACF is a large and complex system.  There are eight
IBM manuals devoted to RACF detail documentation.  If you have a
question that hasn't yet been answered, please either send it
online to GB.SEC, call (415) 723-9797 or mail it to the Information
Security Office; 4136 Polya Hall; Stanford, CA 94305-4136.
Alternatively, you can use the CONSULT feature of WYLBUR.  Type
CONSULT and select the "Access and Security" topic.

EXAMPLES

The following examples assume that a user has an account default of
private (public none) and that the user's datasets are protected as
follows:

     Profile: DEFAULT                      Public None
              WYL.gg.uuu.ARCHIVE.YEAR80
              WYL.gg.uuu.ARCHIVE.YEAR81
              WYL.gg.uuu.ARCHIVE.YEAR82
              WYL.gg.uuu.ARCHIVE.YEAR83
              WYL.gg.uuu.ARCHIVE.YEAR84
              WYL.gg.uuu.ARCHIVE.YEAR85
              WYL.gg.uuu.EXEC
              WYL.gg.uuu.LOAD
              WYL.gg.uuu.MAIL
              WYL.gg.uuu.SOURCE

     Profile: WYL.gg.uuu.DOC               Public Read
              WYL.gg.uuu.DOC

     Profile: WYL.gg.uuu.LIB               Group FRIENDS READ
              WYL.gg.uuu.LIB

     Profile: WYL.gg.uuu.TEST*             Group TEST UPDATE
              WYL.gg.uuu.TEST.DAY1
              WYL.gg.uuu.TEST.DAY2
              WYL.gg.uuu.TEST.DAY3
              WYL.gg.uuu.TEST.MONTH.JAN
              WYL.gg.uuu.TEST.MONTH.FEB
              WYL.gg.uuu.TESTLIB

EXAMPLE 1:  Change the account default to group PROJECT READ.

     SET PROTECT DEFAULT FOR PROJECT READ

     Note that all datasets protected by the former account default
     (Public None) will now be protected by PROJECT READ.

EXAMPLE 2:  Protect all archive datasets for group AUDIT READ.

     SET PROTECT WYL.gg.uuu.ARCHIVE.YEAR%% FOR AUDIT READ

     or

     SET PROTECT WYL.gg.uuu.ARCHIVE.* FOR AUDIT READ

EXAMPLE 3:  Create a new group (eg. MYGROUP).

     RACF ADDGROUP MYGROUP

     This group name will be entered into a group name table and
     you will be notified that it is ready to be used within 24
     hours.

EXAMPLE 4:  Connect new accounts to an existing group.

     RACF CONNECT gg.uuu groupname [authority]

EXAMPLE 5:  Protect all test files (except TESTLIB) for UPDATE
            access by a testing group (TESTGRP).  Protect TESTLIB
            for reading by the same group.

     SET PROTECT WYL.gg.uuu.TEST.* for TESTGRP UPDATE
     SET PROTECT WYL.gg.uuu.TEST* RESET
     SET PROTECT WYL.gg.uuu.TESTLIB for TESTGRP READ

EXAMPLE 6:  Protect all test files, including TESTLIB, for ALTER
            access by account GG$ABC.

     SET PROTECT WYL.gg.uuu.TEST* FOR GG$ABC ALTER

EXAMPLE 7:  Start logging all updates to all files for my account.

     SET PROTECT DEFAULT FOR LOG WRITE

EXAMPLE 8:  Show the protection for the EXEC library.

     SHOW PROTECT EXEC

EXAMPLE 9:  Show the protections for all datasets.

     SHOW PROTECT ALL

WARNINGS

RACF is both powerful and flexible.  If used carefully it can be a
very useful tool.  However, that same power and flexibility can cause
serious trouble and confusion.  Always issue the DUMP PROTECT ALL
before and after making profile changes.  Without these listings it
may be very difficult to recreate a situation that existed prior to
an error.

Below are a few of the "traps" that you may encounter with RACF.
Since these examples are mostly atypical, you need not be overly
concerned.  However, as they illustrate, seemingly innocent changes
can have unexpected results.

WARNING 1

Suppose most of your datasets are protected by your account default,
which is group "gg" read.  Now suppose you want to change your
account default to PUBLIC NONE (private).  Since RACF works dynamically,
all datasets formerly protected by the account default are no longer
accessible to anyone in group "gg."  If users in group "gg" expect to
be able to read one of your datasets, they may be surprised.

WARNING 2

If your default profile is group "gg" read, issuing the command
SET PROTECT DEFAULT FOR PUBLIC NONE will not remove the "gg" read
access rule.  Now you have two access rules.  Had you issued the
command SET PROTECT DEFAULT FOR GROUP gg REMOVE, the result would
have been PUBLIC NONE or NO NON-OWNER ACCESS ALLOWED.

WARNING 3

Suppose you have a number of datasets that follow a naming convention
and you have issued the following commands:

   SET PROTECT WYL.gg.uuu.aaa.bbb.ccc.*  FOR GROUP group-1 ALTER
   SET PROTECT WYL.gg.uuu.aaa.bbb.*      FOR GROUP group-2 READ
   SET PROTECT WYL.gg.uuu.aaa.*          FOR GROUP group-1 ALTER

If you remove the first profile, then group-1 no longer has access
to WYL.gg.uuu.aaa.bbb.ccc.* datasets since these datasets are now
protected by the second profile, which only allows group-2 access.

To avoid this "trap" one must issue the following additional command
at the time the first profile is removed:

   SET PROTECT WYL.gg.uuu.aaa.bbb.* FOR GROUP group-1 ALTER

The end result then becomes:

   SET PROTECT WYL.gg.uuu.aaa.bbb.*      FOR GROUP group-1 ALTER
   SET PROTECT WYL.gg.uuu.aaa.bbb.*      FOR GROUP group-2 READ
   SET PROTECT WYL.gg.uuu.aaa.*          FOR GROUP group-1 ALTER
