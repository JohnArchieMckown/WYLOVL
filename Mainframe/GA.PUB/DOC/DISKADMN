DESCRIPTION

DISKADMN produces a comprehensive report of usage of batch and WYLBUR
disk space by all members of an account group.  For each account in
the group, an individual page of the report lists all data sets,
their volumes, creation dates, tracks, extents, number of empty
tracks and the number of days since the data set was last accessed.

Summary statistics for each member of the group and for the group as
a whole indicate the number of data sets and the number of tracks,
as well as how many data sets and tracks are empty, idle, or on an
inappropriate volume for the group.  DISKADMN uses information in
the system that is only updated once a week (usually Tuesday nights)
so running the report more frequently than weekly would result in
duplicate information.

JOB REQUIREMENTS:

To use the utility, the following job setup is required:

    //  JOB
    //  EXEC   DISKADMN

This will create a report for the group under which the job was
run.  It is also possible to specify several options:

    //  JOB
    //  EXEC   DISKADMN,GROUP=gg,VOL=volume

The GROUP option allows the report to be produced for a group other
than the group running the job.

The VOL option specifies the volume or volumes the group uses for
data set storage; any data sets on other volumes will be
highlighted in the report.  The VOL specified need not be the name
of a single volume, such as "PUB104", but can be the "stem" of the
names of several volumes:  VOL=PUB1, for example.  This
specification would cause the program to flag any datasets that
were not on the public (PUB1) volumes.  "VOL=PUB" is the default
if the user does not specify this option.

A job setup specifying these options would look like this:

     //  JOB
     //  EXEC   DISKADMN,VOL=PUB1,GROUP=XA

The options can be specified in any order, and need not both
appear.

The report is formatted so it fits on letter-size paper.  If you
want to print the report on the 3800 laser printer, add this
statement right after the JOB statement:
