*05/24/83  CHANGE TO ZETA PLOTTER PEN SETUPS

A new pen setup, ABLK, is available on the Zeta 3610 plotter.  The
current liquid ink pen setup, LBLK, will be changed on Wednesday,
June 1, so pen number 1 will be the wide (size 1) rather than the
very fine (size 00) pen.  Jobs run (or released) after the end of
plotting service on Tuesday, May 31, will use this revised setup.  A
complete summary of available pen setups is shown in the table below.

USING THE ZETA 3610 PLOTTER

The Zeta plotter can be used by programs using the OPS or UGS
plotting packages, programs using the CalComp-style subroutines, and
by Top Drawer.  (The current Top Drawer implementation is temporary
and somewhat limited, but this will be fixed soon.)  Documentation
for OPS, UGS, and Top Drawer is available in Document Sales,
Forsythe Hall.

Plots may be on either plain (the default) or grid paper.  To get
grid paper, specify PLTFORM=GRID on the EXEC statement.  Vellum and
Mylar will be available in the near future at additional cost.

Three standard pen setups are available, and are indicated by the
PENCODE option:

              size 000      size 0       size 2       size 4

The LBLK setup provides four line widths; the BCOL and RCOL setups
provide four colors.  Additional pen setups, and the ability to
specify special pen setups, may be available in the future.

***LBLK PEN SETUP WILL CHANGE ON JUNE 1, 1983; SEE ABOVE*********

USING THE ZETA PLOTTER WITH UGS OR OPS

Use any of the standard FORTRAN cataloged procedures, such as FORTCG,
WATFIV, and FORTGO.  These procedures include the necessary ZETAPLOT
DD statement.  Do not use the "T" suffixed versions (FORTCGT, etc.)
designed for use with the CalComp plotter.  No plot tape is used, so
no SETUP statement is neccessary unless you are using a tape for
some other purpose.  Specify a device code of ZET36SM (for 10-inch
plots) or ZET36LG (for 33-inch plots) on the call to STARTG or
UGOPEN.  You can also specify PENCODE on this call.  Some examples
of using the Zeta plotter with OPS follow.

Example 1:  To produce a plot for publication using black liquid ink
and four line widths:

   //  EXEC  FORTCG
          .
          .
          .
         CALL STARTG(
        -'ZET36SM,PENCODE=LBLK,PEN2=DIMM,PEN3=BRIT,PEN4=VBRT*',0.0)

For jobs run on or after June 1, 1983, the first argument to STARTG
should be:  'ZET36SM,PENCODE=LBLK,PEN2=DIMM,PEN3=VDIM,PEN4=VBRT*'

Example 2:  To use four colors of liquid roller pens:

   //  EXEC  FORTCG
           .
           .
           .
         CALL STARTG(
        -'ZET36SM,PENCODE=RCOL,PEN2=COL2,PEN3=COL3,PEN4=COL4*',0.0)


USING THE ZETA WITH TOP DRAWER

The following procedure is a temporary one; a more flexible and
straightforward method of using the Zeta with Top Drawer will be
available soon.

Specify TDVER=ZETA on the EXEC statement.  For example:

   //  EXEC  TOPDRAW,TDVER=ZETA

Specify SMALL CALCOMP on the SET DEVICE command.  PENCODE is also
specified on the SET DEVICE command.  For example:

   SET DEVICE SMALL CALCOMP 'PENCODE=LBLK'

At present, this version of Top Drawer can use only the small
plotter, and only 3 pens.  Some examples of using the Zeta plotter
with TOPDRAW are given below.

CAUTION:  At this time TOPDRAW does not select pens correctly when
used with the Zeta plotter.  We are working on the problem; in the
meantime, you should plan on using only one pen (the first one).

Example 1:  To produce a plot for publication, using black liquid ink
and four line widths:

   //  EXEC  TOPDRAW,TDVER=ZETA
   SET DEVICE SMALL CALCOMP 'PENCODE=LBLK'

Example 2:  To use four colors of liquid roller pens:

   //  EXEC  TOPDRAW,TDVER=ZETA
   SET DEVICE SMALL CALCOMP 'PENCODE=RCOL'


PLOT DATA SETS

The output for the Zeta plotter is directed to SYSOUT=Z (the Zeta
appears to the system as a printer).  The printer options FCB, UCS
and forms code are used to define plotter options as follows:

1.  Narrow paper is indicated by FCB=NARO, wide paper by FCB=WIDE.
    These values are set by the plotting software and ordinarily
    should not be set or changed by the user.

2.  The pen code is indicated by UCS; this is also set by the
    software.  The UCS value may be reported as CHARS when you
    LOCATE the job.

3.  The paper type is indicated by the form code; this is not set by
    the software but must be specified in your JCL if you don't
    want the default paper.  For the standard TOPDRAW, FORTRAN, and
    WATFIV cataloged procedures, the symbolic parameter PLTFORM is
    used to set the form code.  For example:

       //  EXEC  WATFIV,PLTFORM=GRID


JCL NOTES:

The cataloged procedures for TOPDRAW, FORTRAN, and WATFIV each
contain a //VERSATEC DD statement for the Versatec plotter and a
//ZETAPLOT DD statement for the Zeta plotter.  The plotting software
(UGS) will use ddname VERSATEC when the Versatec plotter is
selected and ZETAPLOT when the Zeta 3610 is selected.

The data set has RECFM=FB set internally and will accept any LRECL
from 64 through 256; if no value or one outside this range is
supplied, a default of 64 is used.  When the data set is directed
to SYSOUT, the default BLKSIZE will be equal to LRECL.  When the data
set is on disk or tape, default BLKSIZE will be 6233 (rounded down
to a multiple of LRECL).

The DD statements used in the cataloged procedures are:

   //VERSATEC  DD  SYSOUT=(V,,&PLTFORM),
   //  DCB=(RECFM=FBA,LRECL=126,BLKSIZE=126)
   //ZETAPLOT  DD  SYSOUT=(Z,,&PLTFORM)

PLTFORM has a default value of null; JES2 will supply a default of
FOLD for Versatec (SYSOUT=V) data sets and PLOT for Zeta (SYSOUT=Z)
data sets.


USE OF THE ZETA PLOTTER WITH NON-STANDARD SOFTWARE

If you use the CalComp subroutines (PLOTS, PLOT, etc.) rather than
the UGS or OPS subroutines, keep in mind that these subroutines
receive only limited support.  The following considerations apply:

1.  The CalComp-style subroutines for the Zeta plotter reside in
    SYS4.ZETA.LOAD, which is not in the standard SYSLIB lists.
    Therefore, you must include a DD statement for this library in
    your link-edit or load step.  You must use one of the FORTRAN
    procedures, because these subroutines are not WATFIV-compatible.

2.  Your call to PLOTS should be of the form:

         CALL PLOTS (53,0,nn)

    where "nn" is the data set reference number for the plot data
    set.

3.  It is not necessary to call FACTOR to set the scale.  That is,
    scaling will be correct without a call to FACTOR.

4.  Supply a DD statement of the form:

    //FTnnF001  DD  SYSOUT=(Z,,form),FCB=fcb,UCS=pencode

    where "nn" is the data set reference number, "form" is one of
    PLOT or GRID, "fcb" is one of NARO or WIDE, and "pencode" is one
    of the pen codes shown above.

5.  At the beginning and end of the plot, plot a header/trailer
    frame.  This frame must contain your job name, job number, and
    account.  The subroutine JOBINF may be used to obtain this
    information from the system.
