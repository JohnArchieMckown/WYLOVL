Title:  Hermlite Interpolation

Library Program Number:  C018

Subprogram name(s):  HMRIT1

Summary:  This procedure evaluates, at a given abscissa, a
(2N+1)th-degree Hermite polynomial passing through N+1 points.  The
first derivative of the polynomial at each of the N+1 points must
be given to the procedure.

Field of application:  Mathematics

Search key:  Hermite, Interpolation

Languages from which this routine may be called:  FORTRAN IV; OS/360
                                                  Assembler


Principal source language:  OS/360 FORTRAN IV (H)

Type of routine:  Standard OS/360 FORTRAN IV (H) subroutine
subprogram

Machine on which routine will execute:  IBM System/360

Monitor or operating system required:  OS/360

Special machine requirements:  None

Call:  CALL HRMIT1 (N, U, X, Y, Y1, ANS)

Parameters:

     Parameter     Type                   Description

       N        full word integer    polynomial evaluated is of
                                     degree 2N+1

       U        real variable        abscissa where interpolation
                short precision      is desired

       X        real array           abscissas of N+1 points through
                short precision      which the polynomial passes

       Y        real array           ordinates of N+1 points
                short precision      through which the polynomial
                                     passes

       Y1       real array           1st derivatives of the
                short precision      polynomial at the N+1 points

       ANS      real variable        value of the polynomial at U
                                     differences to be taken

Declarations:  None

Special system control cards needed:  None

Use:  See Summary

      Example:

      If:

         X(1) = 1   Y(1) = 1   Y1(1) = 2
         X(2) = 2   Y(2) = 4   Y1(2) = 4
         X(3) = 3   Y(3) = 9   Y1(3) = 6

         N = 1
         U = 8.754

     Then:     CALL HRMIT1 (N, U, X, Y, Y1, ANS)

        results in

        ANS = 0.76632568 E 02
