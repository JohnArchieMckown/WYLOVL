.* DESCRIPTION
The DELETE command removes the specified range of lines from the active file.

The short form of the DELETE command consists of responding to the command
prompt by typing in a single line number, immediately followed by pressing the
RETURN key.  When NOSHORT mode is in effect, WYLBUR accepts this short form
only after a permission prompt.  (Type HELP SET MODES for a description of the
NOSHORT and SHORT modes.)\ Note that the normal abbreviation of L and F for
the line numbers LAST and FIRST cannot be used in this form of the DELETE
command.

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the range of lines in the active file to be deleted.
                This option is required and must be specified first.  Type
                HELP RANGE for a description of range.

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\NOLIST is the default for this command unless SET MODES LIST
                is in effect.  (Type HELP SET MODES for a description of the
                SET MODES command.)\ LIST causes each line to be displayed as
                it is deleted.  LIST cannot be abbreviated as L because L is
                the abbreviation for LAST; for example, DELETE 12/14,L means
                delete lines 12 through 14 and the last line of the file.  For
                a description of all the list options, type HELP LIST-OPTIONS.

.* OPTION VERIFY
.optix VERIFY
VERIFY\\\\\\\\\\causes WYLBUR to list each line before deleting it and to
                issue a permission prompt "Delete (Yes/No/Modify/Edit)?".  You
                can make the following responses:

                   YES, Y, OK  -- delete the line
                   NO, N       -- don't delete the line
                   MODIFY, M   -- MODIFY the line instead of deleting the line
                   EDIT, E     -- EDIT the line instead of deleting the line

                If you press the BREAK key, the DELETE command is aborted; but
                all changes prior to the BREAK are retained.
