.* DESCRIPTION
The COPY command duplicates all or part of the active file and puts the copied
text at another place in the active file.  If you issue COPY without options,
WYLBUR copies the entire active file to the end of the current active file.
You use a special form of the COPY command (using the FROM or EXECUTE options)
to copy all or part of an external file or the EXEC file to the active file.

To copy a range from one place in the active file to another and delete the
old copy of the lines, use the MOVE command.  (Type HELP MOVE for a
description of the MOVE command.)\

The complete syntax of the COPY command is shown above; the command forms
below illustrate typical option groupings.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\is the range of lines to be copied.  If this option is used,
                it must be specified first.  If it is not specified, the
                entire file will be copied.  The range will be taken from the
                active file, unless the FROM dsname or the EXECUTE option is
                specified.  Type HELP RANGE for a description of range.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Note:  If you specify a symbolic line number with the FROM
                dsname option, be aware that certain line numbers may not
                exist in the external file (e.g., FIRST in an external file
                has the value 0 and LAST the value 99999.999).

.* OPTION EXECUTE
.optix EXECUTE
EXECUTE\\\\\\\\\specifies that the range of lines to be copied should come
                from the EXEC file.

.* OPTION FROM
.optix FROM
FROM\dsname\\\\\is the name of an external file from which the specified or
                default range is to be copied.  Type HELP DSNAME for a
                description of dsname.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR,PUBLIC
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to copy a data set belonging to an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME
.optix ON
ON\volume\\\\\\\indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ If
                this option is not specified, WYLBUR searches the system
                catalog (an index of data sets) for the data set name and its
                volume location.  If the data set is not cataloged, WYLBUR
                will use the volume set with the SET VOLUME command.  (All
                data sets are automatically cataloged when they are saved,
                unless you specify otherwise.)\

.* OPTION FORMAT-OPTIONS,EDIT,CARD,PRINT,LRECL
.optix format-options
format-options\\allow you to specify the record length and the treatment of
                WYLBUR line numbers in the external file.  The format-options
                NUMBERED, UNNUMBERED, and INTEGER apply only to COPY FROM;
                they do not apply to COPY.  Type HELP FORMAT-OPTIONS for a
                description of the format-options.

.* OPTION TO
.optix TO
TO\line-number\\specifies the beginning line number in the active file to
                which the range of lines is to be copied.  If TO is omitted,
                TO END is the default.

.* OPTION BY
.optix BY
BY\increment\\\\is the line number increment, or delta, by which the
                successive line numbers of the copied range are incremented.
                If not specified, the default value is selected.  (Type HELP
                DELTA for a description of delta.)\ If the value of delta,
                specified or default, would cause the copied lines to
                interleave existing lines in the file, WYLBUR automatically
                calculates a new value of delta so that interleaving does not
                take place.  (See the MERGE and COMBINE options for
                exceptions.)\

.* OPTION DITTO
.optix DITTO
DITTO=d\\\\\\\\\specifies that the copied lines are to be duplicated d times
                at the specified line number.  "d" may be any integer from 1
                to 32767 inclusive.

.* OPTION MERGE
.optix MERGE
MERGE\\\\\\\\\\\allows interleaving -- but no replacement -- of the copied
                lines with the existing lines.  The copied lines will not
                retain their original line numbers.

.* OPTION PLUS
.optix PLUS
PLUS\[-]n\\\\\\\specifies a positive or negative number to be added to each
                line number of the range to be copied.  (PLUS implies MERGE.)\

.* OPTION COMBINE
.optix COMBINE
COMBINE\\\\\\\\\allows the copied range of lines to retain the original line
                numbers.  Thus it can be used to combine several files while
                retaining a separate numbering system for each.  This implies
                MERGE, but MERGE need not be specified.  For example, with the
                command COPY 3/5 FROM #FILE1 COMBINE, and an active file that
                contains lines 1, 2, and 10, the copied lines will be copied
                after line number 2 and before line number 10 in the active
.pa
                file.  The copied lines will retain their original numbers,
                i.e., 3, 4, 5.

.* OPTION REPLACE
.optix REPLACE
REPLACE\\\\\\\\\specifies that the copied lines can replace and/or interleave
                existing lines.  WYLBUR will not change the increment when
                REPLACE is specified.  This option implies MERGE and can be
                used with COMBINE.

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\NOLIST is the default for this command.  LIST lists the line
                immediately preceding the line copied to and each line as it
                is copied.  LIST is not allowed with COPY FROM.  The
                list-options NUMBERED, UNNUMBERED, and INTEGER apply to COPY;
                they do not apply to COPY FROM.  Type HELP LIST-OPTIONS for a
                description of the list-options.
