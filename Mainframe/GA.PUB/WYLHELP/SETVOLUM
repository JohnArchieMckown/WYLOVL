.* DESCRIPTION
The SET VOLUME command allows you to specify a default disk volume that WYLBUR
uses when you issue a SAVE command.  This is usually not necessary since
WYLBUR automatically selects a volume for you when you save a data set.

Once you have specified a default volume, you can reset it so that no volume
is set by issuing the SET VOLUME command without including an option.

The SHOW VOLUME command displays the current volume set by the logged-on user.
