SET USERID

.* DESCRIPTION
Type SET USERID by itself, and WYLBUR will take you through the process
of setting your UserID.

The SET USERID command allows you to set a UserID for your account that can be
used in many places in WYLBUR where your account number can be used.  Because
it is a value that you choose yourself (usually some form of your name, such
as "Billy.Carter"), it is usually more meaningful to others than your account
number.  If you have a UserID set, it appears in the WYLBUR mail header and in
some other command responses that otherwise display your account number, such
as SHOW USERS or SHOW LINE.

The SET USERID command can only be issued once for an account, and it cannot be
easily changed. If you need to change it, contact the Account Services office.
(Type HELP PHONES for that phone number.)  Because of its permanence, you may
want to think about what you want for your UserID before setting it.  For
guidelines on choosing a UserID, see the document "UserIDs on the Forsythe
Computer" (DOC#USERIDS PUBLIC), which is available through the PUBLISH command:
PUBLISH 957.  It has more information about UserIDs in general.

The SHOW USERID command displays the UserID for your account, as well as any
aliases you have set.  Aliases work similarly to UserIDs, except that they do
not generally appear to other users.  Type HELP SET ALIAS for more information.
