Carriage Control in WYLBUR

Carriage control symbols in column 1, in conjunction with the CC option on
LIST, PRINT or LPRINT commands, control where the line of text will be printed
or displayed on the "page".  The data set's column 1 must contain nothing but
the characters listed below or blanks.  For example, the text line "1You're
the top." would cause the text "You're the top." to appear on the top line of
the next page.  The carriage control symbols are not printed.

The basic carriage control symbols are:

     1  -  go to the top of the next page
     F  -  go to the top of the next front page (in DUPLEX mode only)
     0  -  double space: go to the next line +1
     -  -  triple space: go to the next line +2
     +  -  remain on the same line; used for underlining and overprinting
 blank  -  go to the next line
