PUTLINE line-number [text]

.* DESCRIPTION
The PUTLINE statement inserts or replaces the specified line in the active
file with the specified text.  For example, the statement:

     PUTLINE 12 This is line 12

puts the text "This is line 12" in line 12.  If line 12 already existed in the
file, it is now replaced with this text.  If line 12 did not exist, it is
inserted.

This should be used instead of simply "12 This is line 12".  This statement is
primarily useful in EXEC files.
