Pattern

In addition to explicit line ranges and associative ranges, WYLBUR can match
patterns of characters in its searches; it can fine certain types and patterns
of characters alone or in combination with specific strings of characters.
You can use the pattern matching on the LIST, VIEW, MODIFY, EDIT, and POINT
commands.

Use WYLBUR's pattern matching ability by putting a letter P before a range.
The "P" indicates to WYLBUR to treat the following range as one including a
pattern.  To define the pattern you want to find, you can use what are called
"generic descriptors" or variables indicating what type of character you are
looking for.  The generic descriptors and their meanings are:

     <A>  any character from A-Z, upper- or lowercase
     <N>  any number
     <B>  a blank space
     <S>  a special character (includes punctuation)
     <C>  a non-printable character (control-character)
     <X>  any character

Generic indicators must be listed in angle brackets <>.  You can specify a
number of indicators with a number or an asterisk to represent an
indeterminate number.

Examples:

   MODIFY P'<N>' 10/20     Modify any line that contains a number in columns
                           10 through 20.

   POINT P'<3N>-<4N>'      Point to any lines containing three numbers
                           followed by a dash followed by four numbers (phone
                           numbers).

   VIEW P'EXEC<*X>CLEAR'   View lines containing the string "EXEC" followed by
                           any number of characters followed by the string
                           "CLEAR".

   LIST P'<C>' MIXED       List those lines containing unprintable characters
                           (control-characters).

You can combine or divide the generic descriptors as you want.  "<*ABS>" and
"<*A><B><S>" are equivalent.
