.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW CATALOG command displays an alphabetized list of your data set names
in the system catalog.  Whenever you save a data set, WYLBUR enters the name
of that data set in the system catalog.  (It is possible to have data sets
with names that are not in the catalog; however, this is not normally the
case.)\

.* SELECT 'SHOW CATALOG Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION GG.UUU,ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR,PUBLIC
.optix gg.uuu
gg.uuu\\\\\\\\\\specifies the account to display the cataloged data sets
                belonging to an account other than that of the logged-on user.
                Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a description of the
                account-options.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME,?,TEMPORARY
.optix ON
.optix TEMPORARY
.ix ? 'on volume'
ON\{volume|TEMPORARY}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ON volume displays only the data set names of data sets
                cataloged on the specified volume.  The volume can contain a
                question mark (?) in any position to match any character in
                the data set's volume.  For example:

                   SHOW CATALOG ON PUB???

                will display the names of data sets on any volume beginning
                with "PUB".  TEMPORARY display only the data set names of data
                sets cataloged on a temporary volume (e.g., SCR002).

.* OPTION LIKE
.optix LIKE
LIKE\{string|*}\string displays only the data set names that begin with the
                specified string.  If * is specified instead, the current
                prefix setting is used.  (Type HELP SET PREFIX for a
                description of SET PREFIX.)\ string may consist of an
                alphabetic character, a string of characters, or a data set
                name.

.* OPTION FROM
.optix FROM
FROM\{string1|*}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\string1 specifies that the first data set name, the lower
                limit, is to start the display list.  If * is specified
                instead, the current prefix setting is used.  (Type HELP SET
                PREFIX for a description of SET PREFIX.)\ If the FROM option
                is omitted, the displayed list starts with the first data set
                name in the catalog.  string1 may consists of an alphabetic
                character, a string of characters, or a data set name.

.* OPTION TO
.optix TO
TO\{string2|*}\\string2 specifies that the last data set name, the upper
                limit, is to end the display list.  If * is specified instead,
                the current prefix setting is used.  (Type HELP SET PREFIX for
                a description of SET PREFIX.)\ If the TO option is omitted,
                the displayed list ends with the last data set name in the
                catalog.  string2 may consist of an alphabetic character, a
                string of characters, or a data set name.

.* OPTION DISK
.optix DISK
DISK\\\\\\\\\\\\displays only the data set names of data sets that are
                cataloged on disk (excluding data sets cataloged on tape).

.* OPTION TAPE
.optix TAPE
TAPE\\\\\\\\\\\\displays only the data set names of data sets that are
                cataloged on tape (excluding data sets cataloged on disk).

.* OPTION VOLUME
.optix VOLUME
VOLUME\\\\\\\\\\displays the volume for each data set.  For data sets
                cataloged on tape devices, the file sequence number and (for
                multi-volume data sets) the number of volumes is displayed.

.* OPTION INTERNAL
.optix INTERNAL
INTERNAL\\\\\\\\causes each data set to be displayed in a fixed format.  This
                is helpful when the response is being directed to the ACTIVE
                file for (i.e., DUMP CATALOG INTERNAL) further processing.  No
                response will be given if no data sets or the requested data
                set can be found.  The format is:

\....v....1....v....2....v....3....v....4....v....5....v....6.
\c ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddvvvvvv t fffnnn
   ....v....1....v....2....v....3....v....4....
