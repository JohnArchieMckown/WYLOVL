.* DESCRIPTION
RACF, or Resource Access Control Facility, is both a WYLBUR command and an IBM
access and security product.  For further information about the IBM product
type LIST or PRINT FROM DOC#PROTECT PUBLIC.

The RACF command extends the functionality of the SET and SHOW PROTECT
commands.  The syntax of the SET and SHOW PROTECT commands was limited to
provide the essential and common functions needed to provide access to data
and to see how data are protected.  Rather than make those two commands
suffice for all functions, the RACF command handles important, but less
common, group related functions.

The RACF command is used to establish, maintain and list all group
memberships.  These groups may be used in place of individual account IDs in
the SET PROTECT command.

The RACF command can only perform one function per execution.

.* SELECT 'RACF Command Options'

.* OPTION ADDGROUP,AG
.optix ADDGROUP
ADDGROUP|AG\\\\\Adds a new group profile.  The group name must be 8 characters
                or less and must be unique.  Group names are assigned on a
                first-come first-served basis.  You may not use a new group
                name until you receive confirmation that your chosen name is
                acceptable.  The confirmation will happen within 24 hours.  In
                addition to the groupname, the command option also allows for
                descriptive text following the groupname.  For example:  RACF
                AG DOCREV Documentation review group.

.* OPTION DELGROUP,DG
.optix DELGROUP
DELGROUP|DG\\\\\This option deletes an existing group profile.  The group-
                name must match to an existing groupname that is owned by the
                account attempting to delete it.

.* OPTION CONNECT,CO
.optix CONNECT
CONNECT|CO\\\\\\Connect an account (gg.uuu) to a group with an authority.  The
                authorities are:

                USE       Allows the user to access any dataset to which the
                          group is authorized.  This is the default.

                CONNECT   Allows the user to connect other users to the group.

.* OPTION DISCONNECT,DC
.optix DISCONNECT
DISCONNECT|DC\\\Disconnect a user (gg.uuu) from an existing group.

.* OPTION LISTGROUP,LG
.optix LISTGROUP
LISTGROUP|LG\\\\List a group profile which includes current membership and

                the end of your ACTIVE file.

.* OPTION LISTUSER,LU

LISTUSER|LU\\\\\List your user profile which includes a list of all groups to
                which you belong.
