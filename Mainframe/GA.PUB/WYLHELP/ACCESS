.* DESCRIPTION
The access-options on the SET PROTECT command control the level of access that
you are giving an account or group of accounts to a file or a set of files (a
profile.)  Type HELP SET PROTECT for information on the SET PROTECT command.

.* SELECT 'Access-Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION REMOVE
.optix REMOVE
REMOVE\\\\\\\\\\Removes a single access rule from a RACF profile leaving all
                other accesses intact.  E.g. SET PROTECT profilename FOR gg.uuu
                REMOVE.

.* OPTION NONE
.optix NONE
NONE\\\\\\\\\\\\Allows no access by the target to the data sets protected by
                the profile. E.g. SET PROTECT profilename FOR PUBLIC NONE.
                If this is the only access rule, then it is equivalent to
                'no non-owner access.'

.* OPTION READ
.optix READ
READ\\\\\\\\\\\\Allows reading (or executing from) the data set.  You can
                write (rewrite) or scratch any data set to which you have READ
                access if you can supply the password for the owner account.
                FORTRAN users should see the Batch Processing manual for
                special cautions to be observed when reading data sets from a
                FORTRAN program.  For batch access, datasets protected with
                READ access may only be read since there is no way to supply
                the password for writing/rewriting.

.* OPTION UPDATE
.optix UPDATE
UPDATE\\\\\\\\\\Identical to READ access if access is from Wylbur or BATWYL.
                If the access is from the batch (but not BATWYL), then
                UPDATE access allows for updating (rewriting) without the
                password.

.* OPTION CONTROL
.optix CONTROL
CONTROL\\\\\\\\\Applies to VSAM data sets only.  Allows updating of control
RACF only\\\\\\\segment information and is needed for IDCAMS VERIFY operations.
                CONTROL is more powerful than UPDATE but not as powerful as
                ALTER.

.* OPTION ALTER
.optix ALTER
ALTER\\\\\\\\\\\Allows full control over datasets or profile names, including
RACF only\\\\\\\reading, writing and scratching datasets.  No password is
                needed.  As the owner of all your own datasets you automat-
                ically have ALTER access to all of your own datasets.
