.* DESCRIPTION
(** Extended EXECs only **)
The REPEAT...UNTIL statement executes the specified command or series of
commands enclosed in BEGIN/END until the expression on the UNTIL statement
evaluates to TRUE.  Unlike the WHILE statement, REPEAT...UNTIL executes the
body of the loop before testing the condition.

For example,

     REPEAT BEGIN
         write 'This is number &(num)'
         num = num + 1
     END
     UNTIL (num GT 10)
