.* DESCRIPTION
The ALTER command allows you to change various options (e.g., destination,
time block, priority) for one or more jobs in the system.

.* SELECT 'ALTER Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION JOBID
.optix jobid
jobid\\\\\\\\\\\identifies the job(s) to be altered.  This option is required
                and must be specified first.  Type HELP\JOBID for the various
                forms of jobid.

.* OPTION MULTIPLE
.optix MULTIPLE
MULTIPLE\\\\\\\\causes the command to be processed if the jobid matches more
                than one jobname in the system.  When several jobs are
                explicitly referred to by number, the MULTIPLE option is not
                necessary.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to alter a job or jobs belonging to an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.  If this option is
                specified, you will be prompted for the password of the
                account before the command is executed.

.* OPTION QUEUE-OPTIONS,QUEUE,Q,EXEC,XEQ,OUTPUT
.optix queue-options
queue-options\\\allow further selection of jobs to be affected by the command.
                Jobs must be in the specified queue (i.e., EXEC or OUTPUT) to
                be affected.  Type HELP\QUEUE-OPTIONS for a description of
                these options.

.* OPTION OUTPUT-OPTIONS,OUTPUT,PRINT,PUNCH,FICHE,PLOT,SYSOUT,FORMS
.optix output-options
output-options\\allow you to restrict the effect of the ALTER command to
                selected groups of data sets.  OUTPUT is the only valid
                output-option when the job is awaiting execution.  However, as
                soon as a job has begun execution, all other options may be
                used.  Type HELP\OUTPUT-OPTIONS for a description of the
                output-options.

.* OPTION OUTGRP
.optix outgrp
OUTGRP=group\\\\lets you specify a particular output queue entry when a job has
                several.  The outgroup identifiers for a job can be seen with
                the INFO option on the LOCATE command.

.* OPTION DATE
.optix DATE
DATE={mm/dd[/yy]|NEXT|NONE}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\starts execution at the specified date.  You can specify month
                and day (mm/dd) or month, day and year.  NEXT refers to the
                next calendar day.  NONE cancels any previously specified
                date. Note: you cannot specify a date more than 10 days
                in the future.

.* OPTION START
.optix START
START={hh:mm|NONE}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\starts execution at the specified time (24 hour format).  NONE
                cancels any previously specified time and date.

.* OPTION LDATE
.optix LDATE
LDATE={mm/dd[/yy]|NEXT|TODAY|NONE}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\starts execution no later than the specified date.  You can
                specify month and day (mm/dd) or month, day and year.  NEXT
                refers to the next calendar day.  TODAY means today, and is the
                default when LSTART is specified but no LDATE.  NONE cancels
                any previously specified date.  LDATE is seldom used without
                LTIME. You cannot specify a date more than 10 days in the
                future.

.* OPTION LSTART
.optix LSTART
LSTART={hh:mm|NONE}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\starts execution no later than the specified time (24-hour
                format).  If no LDATE is specified, the time is for today (the
                day the job is submitted. NONE cancels any previously specified
                time.

.* OPTION CLASS,C
.optix CLASS
CLASS=jobclass\\specifies the new job class, which may be B, C, E, P, F or L.
                This option will be effective only if the job has not yet
.cs 2 on
                entered execution.  See the Batch Processing manual for more
                information about job classes.

entered execution.  See
.italic 'Batch Processing'
for more information about job classes.
.docend
.cs 1 off

.* OPTION NHOLD
.optix NHOLD
NHOLD={[+]n|-n}\specifies the network hold count, where n specifies a change
                to the current hold count, +n specifies an addition to the
                current hold count, and -n specifies a subtraction from the
                current hold count.  This count can be changed only when the
                job is awaiting execution.

.* OPTION PRIORITY,P,PR,PRTY
.optix PRIORITY
PRIORITY=priority
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the priority at which the job is to run.  Valid
                values, in order of increasing priority, are:  LOW, STANDARD,
                or URGENT.  They may be abbreviated to L, S, U.  STANDARD
                priority is assumed if this option is not used.  URGENT
                priority will incur higher charges.  See DOC#RATES PUBLIC for
.cs 2 on
                a description of rates.  See the Batch Processing manual for a
                description of job priorities.

.docend
.cs 1 off

.* OPTION BLOCK
.optix BLOCK
BLOCK=block\\\\\specifies the time block when the job can run, be printed or
                punched.  Valid time blocks are:  PEAK, DAY, EVENING, NIGHT,
                WEEKEND or ANY.  All but ANY may be abbreviated: P, D, E, N, W.
                If you alter the job before execution, the execution time
                block is affected.  If you alter the job before output
                processing, the new block applies to the output phase.  For
                the current time block schedule, see DOC#SCHEDULE PUBLIC.

.* OPTION DEST
.optix DEST
DEST=destination
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the destination for altering the output of the job.
                Valid destinations include:

                   LOCAL          Forsythe Hall
                   SELF           Forsythe Hall, self-service printer
                   RMTn           Remote work station n

.* OPTION BIN
.optix BIN
BIN=nnn\\\\\\\\\causes the output to be routed to bin nnn.

.* OPTION TO
.optix TO
TO\\\\\\\\\\\\\\used to selectively alter the SYSOUT and/or FORMS of a job's
                output from another SYSOUT and/or FORMS.

.* OPTION SYSOUT
.optix SYSOUT
SYSOUT=s\\\\\\\\specifies one of the SYSOUT output classes:  A, B, C, D, M, P,
                or V.  Output data sets in the specified SYSOUT class will be
                altered.  The TO option is used with the SYSOUT option to
                selectively alter part of a job's output.  For example:

                   ALTER 1234 SYSOUT=A

                alters all job output to SYSOUT=A.

                   ALTER 1234 SYSOUT=C TO SYSOUT=A

                alters all SYSOUT=C output to SYSOUT=A.  This option may only
.cs 2 on
                be specified for jobs awaiting print.  See the Batch
                Processing manual for more information about SYSOUT classes.
.cs 2 off
.cs 1 on
.docbegin
be specified for jobs awaiting print.  See
.italic 'Batch Processing'
for more information about SYSOUT classes.
.docend
.cs 1 off

.* OPTION FORMS
.optix FORMS
FORMS=ffff\\\\\\specifies the form on which the job output should be printed.
                See DOC#FORMS PUBLIC for a list of available forms.  If the
                FORMS code for a job is altered, JES2 will automatically alter
                the carriage control and printer type to the defaults for that
                forms code, unless the FCB or DEST option is also specified.
                The TO option is used with the FORMS option to selectively
                alter part of a job's output.  For example:

                   ALTER 1234 FORMS=BOND TO FORMS=3HOL

                alters all FORMS=BOND to FORMS=3HOL.  This option may only be
                specified for jobs in the output queue.

.* OPTION FLASH
.optix FLASH

                printer, or on a LaserJet or similar printer.

.* OPTION FCB
.optix FCB
FCB=cccc\\\\\\\\specifies a 1-4 character code to be used.  This option may
.cs 2 on
                only be specified for jobs in the output queue.  See the Batch
                Processing manual for a description of the various FCB codes.

.* OPTION DUPLEX,NODUPLEX
.optix DUPLEX
.optix NODUPLEX
DUPLEX|NODUPLEX\DUPLEX requests printing on both sides of the paper.  This
                option is ignored unless output is printed on the 4635
                printer or another printer that supports duplex printing.
                NODUPLEX removes the duplex option from the job.

.* OPTION KEEP,NOKEEP
.optix KEEP
.optix NOKEEP
KEEP|NOKEEP\\\\\KEEP requests that the job be kept in output hold after
                printing, so it can be reprinted if necessary.  NOKEEP removes
                the KEEP option from a job.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the ALTER command
