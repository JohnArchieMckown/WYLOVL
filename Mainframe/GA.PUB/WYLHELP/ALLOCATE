.* DESCRIPTION
The ALLOCATE command creates a WYLBUR library or pre-allocates a sequential
data set.  (Type HELP LIBRARY for a description of library.)\ When you
allocate a library, the system automatically selects a volume for it to reside on,
if you do not specify a volume on the ALLOCATE command.  In addition, WYLBUR
catalogs the library you specify (enters its name and volume location in the
system catalog), so that you do not have to include a volume name in future
commands that reference that library.  Once you issue the ALLOCATE command to
create a library, you can SAVE, USE, SCRATCH, and COPY...FROM members of your
library.

A library name must follow the rules given for specifying dsnames.  (Type
HELP DSNAME for a description of these rules.)\ The member name must be 8 or
fewer characters but it does not have to begin with a letter.

It is recommended that you name one of your libraries LIB.  WYLBUR assumes LIB
as the default library name and a library named LIB is necessary to take
advantage of a Logon EXEC file.

If you omit the library name when specifying a member (e.g., SAVE #DATA),
WYLBUR assumes the library named LIB, unless you set a name with the SET
LIBRARY command.  (Type HELP SET LIBRARY for a description of the command.)\
Whether you omit the library name or not when specifying a member, you must
always precede the member name by a number sign (#), for example:  SAVE
LIB#DATA or SAVE #DATA.  Once you have saved members in your library, you can
issue the SHOW DIRECTORY command to display a list of those members.

In order to remove dead space and to allow additional members to be saved, you
have to periodically CONDENSE your library.  In addition, if you try to save a
library member in a library that needs condensing, WYLBUR asks you if you want
to condense it.  (Type HELP CONDENSE for a description.)\

.* SELECT 'ALLOCATE Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION DSNAME
.optix dsname
dsname\\\\\\\\\\specifies the data set name to be allocated.  This option is
                required.  Type HELP DSNAME for a description of dsname.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME,TEMPORARY
.optix ON
.optix TEMPORARY
ON volume|TEMPORARY
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ON volume specifies the disk volume where the data set is to
                allocated.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\
                TEMPORARY allows you to allocate a library on a temporary
                volume. (You are not charged for data sets saved on temporary
                volumes.  However, each morning all data sets on those volumes
                are scratched.)\ If the ON volume option or TEMPORARY option
                is not specified, the system automatically selects a storage
                volume on which to allocate your library.  Normally you do not
                need to specify a volume.

                If WYLBUR cannot allocate the data set on the requested volume,
                another volume will be substituted, and this will be noted in
                the response to the ALLOCATE command.

.optix STORCLAS
.* OPTION STORCLAS,MGMTCLAS,DATYCLAS
STORCLAS=NAME\\\The storage class for the data set.  Specifying a storage
                class indicates that the data set is to be allocated in
                system-managed storage (SMS).  Normally, a storage class will
                be assigned automatically, and you do not need to specify it.
                Specifying a volume may have the effect of overriding the
                storage class.

.optix MGMTCLAS
MGMTCLAS=name\\\The management class for an SMS data set.  MGMTCLAS will be
                ignored if the data set is not system-managed.  Normally, a
                management class will be assigned, and you do not need to
                specify it.

.optix DATACLAS
DATACLAS=name\\\The data class for an SMS data set.  DATACLAS will be ignored
                if the data set is not system-managed.  DATACLAS is normally
                not used.

.* OPTION FORMAT-OPTIONS,EDIT,CARD,PRINT,RECFM,LRECL,BLKSIZE,NUMBERED,INTEGER,UNNUMBERED,SEQFLD
.optix format-options
format-options\\specify the format for the data set.  EDIT is the default for
                new files and is usually suitable.  Type HELP FORMAT-OPTIONS
                for a description of these options.

.* OPTION KBYTES
.optix KBYTES
KBYTES=n\\\\\\\\specifies the space in Kbytes to assign to the data set.  This
                value is converted to an integral number of tracks by rounding
                up; a track on a 3390 disk holds about 55 Kbytes.\

.* OPTION TRACKS
.optix TRACKS
TRACKS=n\\\\\\\\specifies the number of tracks to assign to the data set. (One
                track of data is about 55 Kbytes on a 3390 disk.)  If none of
                TRACKS, CYLINDERS, or KBYTES is specified, 10 tracks is
                assumed.\

.* OPTION CYLINDERS
.optix CYLINDERS
CYLINDERS=n\\\\\specifies the number of cylinders to assign to the data set.
                (One cylinder on a 3390 disk is 15 tracks.) If none of TRACKS,
                CYLINDERS, or KBYTES is specified, 10 tracks is assumed.\

.* OPTION MEMBERS
.optix MEMBERS
MEMBERS=n\\\\\\\specifies the number of members to leave room for in the
                directory.  (Type HELP LIBRARY for a description of
                directory.)\ If neither MEMBERS nor BLOCKS is specified,
                either 30 or 1-1/2 times the number of tracks, whichever is
                larger, will be used.  Unless you are planning to have an
                unusually large number of members (over 150) in the library,
                this number need not be specified.

.* OPTION BLOCKS
.optix BLOCKS
BLOCKS=n\\\\\\\\specifies the number of directory blocks to be assigned.  A
                block is needed for each 3 members if every member has a
                maximum-length title.  (Type HELP LIBRARY for a description of
                directory.)\ If neither BLOCKS nor MEMBERS is specified,
                either 10 or 1/2 the number of tracks, whichever is larger,
                will be used.  Unless you are planning to have an unusually
                large number of members (over 150) in the library, this number
                need not be specified.

.* OPTION SEQUENTIAL
.optix SEQUENTIAL
SEQUENTIAL\\\\\\causes a sequential data set to be allocated.  This option is
                primarily used to reserve space for a sequential data set.

.* OPTION NOCATALOG,NOCATLG
.optix NOCATALOG
NOCATALOG\\\\\\\specifies that the data set should not be cataloged.  CATALOG
                is the default.  If this option is used, VOLUME must also be
                specified.  NOCATALOG is invalid for system-managed data sets.

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\suppresses the system response that WYLBUR issues when the
                ALLOCATE command is successful.
