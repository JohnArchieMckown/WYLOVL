.* DESCRIPTION
This class of JES2 operator commands displays information about such things as
output devices, execution queues, batch job status, etc.  Each command
provides information that is presently unavailable by any other means.  The
basic form of the command is $D{letter} where you replace {letter} with one of
the specific set of values described below.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION $DA,A
$DA\\\\\\\\\\\\\displays the job information for each active job in the
                system, i.e., being read in, executing or printing.

.* OPTION $DD,D
$DD\\\\\\\\\\\\\displays the device addresses and volume serial numbers of all
                disks currently available.

.* OPTION $DF,F
$DF[,n]\\\\\\\\\displays the number of jobs queued for output at a specific
                station, by forms code.  For example, $DF,21 displays the
                information for remote station 21.  Similarly, $DF,0 displays
                the Forsythe output queue.  If you do not specify the station
                number, WYLBUR assumes Forsythe (station 0).

.* OPTION $DI,I
$DI[n]\\\\\\\\\\displays information about all initiators or a specific
                initiator:  whether it is active or not, and which job classes
                it is handling.  For example, $DI8 displays information for
                initiator 8.

.* OPTION $DN,N
$DN[[,n] [S|X|O] [CLASS=n] [SYSOUT=n] [FORMS=ffff]
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\$DN displays information about all currently non-active jobs
                (i.e., awaiting execution, printing, or punching).  Other
                options restrict the job information as follows:

                n            Jobs at remote station number n.
                S            Jobs in setup.
                X            Jobs awaiting execution.
                O            Jobs awaiting output.
                CLASS=n      Jobs in CLASS n awaiting execution or output.
                SYSOUT=n     Jobs in SYSOUT class n.
                FORMS=ffff   Jobs using FORMS ffff for output.

                Following are some examples of $DN:

                   $DN,1\FORMS=3HOL
                   $DN SYSOUT=C
                   $DN,21\S

.* OPTION $DP,P
$DP\\\\\\\\\\\\\displays the status of printers (this is a subset of the
                information returned by the $DU command).

.* OPTION $DPRTN,PRTN
$DPRTn\\\\\\\\\\displays the status of a particular printer.  For example, the
                command $DPRT1 displays the status of PRINTER1 (the Xerox 4635
                printer).

.* OPTION $DQ,Q
$DQ\\\\\\\\\\\\\displays the number of jobs queued for execution, output, or
                hold by job class (if awaiting execution) or by destination
                (if awaiting print).

.* OPTION $DU,U
$DU[,LINE\n|,RMT\n]
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\$DU gives the status of all JES2-controlled, non-direct access
                devices, usually unit-record devices such as card readers,
                printers, and RJE stations.  Other options display more
                specific information as follows:

                $DU,LINE\n\\\displays the status of unit-record hardware
                             devices connected on the specified RJE line (n).

                $DU,RMT\n\\\\displays the status of a specific remote station
                             (n).
