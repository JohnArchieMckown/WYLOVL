.* DESCRIPTION
The LOGON command is like the LOGOFF command; it ends the terminal session.
However, it does not disconnect your terminal from the computer; instead it
initiates the logon procedure.  This allows an account other than the one
currently logged-on to access the computer without losing the line (or
connection).  LOGON, LOGIN, and SIGNON are equivalent.

If you have one or more active files when you issue the command, WYLBUR
prompts you to verify that your active file(s) can be cleared:

     You still have Active file(s):

          1  New                       8 lines
     =>   2  New                      66 lines, 9 changes

     OK to Clear (Yes/No)?

If you respond YES, Y, or OK, and press the RETURN key, WYLBUR clears your
active file(s), ends your terminal session, and initiates the logon procedure.
If you press the BREAK key, WYLBUR aborts the LOGON command and returns you to
COMMAND mode.

Once the logon procedure is initiated, enter your Data Center account and
password in response to the system prompts.  (For a description of the logon
procedure, including how to establish a connection with the computer, see the
.cs 2 on
handout, How to Logon and Logoff, available from the Information Desk in
Forsythe Hall.)\

.* SELECT 'LOGON Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION SAVE
.optix SAVE
SAVE\\\\\\\\\\\\causes the active file to be saved by WYLBUR at logoff.  The
                data set name will be the same as that of a recovered active
                file (WYL.gg.uuu.ACTIVE).

.* OPTION CLEAR,CLR
.optix CLEAR
CLEAR\\\\\\\\\\\erases the active file of the currently logged-on account.  If
                WARN mode is in effect and the changes exceed the WARN count,
                WYLBUR issues a permission prompt indicating the number of
                changes made since the last USE or SAVE command.  WARN is the
                default at logon.  (Type HELP SET MODES WARN NOWARN for a
                description of the WARN and NOWARN modes.)\

.* OPTION NOWARN
.optix NOWARN
NOWARN\\\\\\\\\\when specified with the CLEAR option, overrides WARN mode, the
                logon default.  (Type HELP SET MODES WARN NOWARN for a
                description of the WARN and NOWARN modes.)\
