.* DESCRIPTION
(** Extended EXECs only **)
The CASES statement lets you evaluate a series of expressions.  It must begin
with the CASES BEGIN statement, and end with an END statement, and may include
any number of CASE statements in between.

The CASE statement evaluates the expression and, if it is true, executes the
following command or block of commands (within BEGIN and END).  Control exits
the CASES statement when the first true expression is encountered.  This is
functionally equivalent to an IF statement with multiple ELSEIF statements.

For example,

   CASES BEGIN
       CASE (x LT 0) x = -1 * x
       CASE (x EQ 0) x = 1
       CASE (x LT 100) BEGIN
            flag = TRUE
            pcall test (x)
            END
       CASE (TRUE) comment Enter a value under 100
   END
