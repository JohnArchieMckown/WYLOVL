.* DESCRIPTION
The SET PROTECT command allows you to set access levels for your disk data
sets.  The owner of a data set (identified in the data set name) may always
issue the SET PROTECT command and may extend this capability to others with
.cs 2 on
the EXTEND option.  (See the Batch Processing manual for more information
about data set security.)\
.cs 2 off
.cs 1 on
.co on

The SHOW PROTECT command is used to examine access levels and may be issued by
all users who have any level of access to the data set.  Type HELP SHOW
PROTECT for a description of SHOW PROTECT.

.* SELECT 'SET PROTECT Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION DSNAME
.optix dsname
dsname\\\\\\\\\\indicates the name of the data set whose security status is to
                be changed.  When the dsname identifies a library (partitioned
                data set), a member name must not be specified; permits apply
                to an entire library rather than individual members.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR,PUBLIC
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to change the protection status of a data
                set belonging to an account other than that of the logged-on
                user.  One form of this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP
                ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a description of the account-options.  You
                must have EXTEND access to the data set of the account in
                order to change the protection status of it.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME
.optix ON
ON\volume\\\\\\\indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ If
                this option is not specified, the volume set with the SET
                VOLUME command will be searched; if no volume is set, the
                system catalog, an index of data sets, will be searched for
                the data set name and volume location.  (All data sets are
                automatically cataloged when they are saved, unless you
                specify otherwise.)\

.* OPTION OWNER
.optix OWNER
OWNER\volume\\\\must be specified instead of a dsname to change volume owner
                permits on a private disk pack.  The volume must be mounted
                when the command is issued.

.* OPTION RESET
.optix RESET
RESET\\\\\\\\\\\causes the permit status to be reset to its original default.
                RESET may be used along with a regular permit; in this case
                the resetting is performed first, and then the specified
                permit is established.

.* OPTION TARGET,FOR
.optix FOR
FOR\{gg.uuu|GROUP\gg|USER\uuu|COMMUNITY|PUBLIC|FILEMASK}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the user or group of users (the "target") to be
                given a certain level of access to a data set.  gg.uuu
                specifies another user having account gg.uuu.  GROUP gg
                specifies a group having group code gg.  USER uuu specifies
                another user having user code uuu and your group code.
                COMMUNITY specifies a community of users; currently this has
                meaning only for administrative and internal accounts.  PUBLIC
                specifies the public, that is, all users.  FILEMASK is not a
                set of users but rather a way of limiting all access to the
                data set.  It sets a maximum level of access that overrides
                all other permits, including your own.  FILEMASK may be set to
                WRITE (default), READ and/or DELETE, PASSWORD, UPDATE, or
                NONE.  In the last case, no access to the data set will be
                permitted for any user, except that the owner may always reset
                the mask with a subsequent SET PROTECT command.  Only the
                owner may use the FILEMASK option; it cannot be extended to
                other users.

.* OPTION ACCESS-OPTIONS
Access options describe the level of access granted to the target user(s).
The available access options are:

.* OPTION ACCESS-OPTIONS,READ
.optix READ
READ\\\\\\\\\\\\allows only reading (or executing from) the data set.  FORTRAN
.cs 2 on
                users should see the Batch Processing manual for special
                cautions to be observed when reading data sets from a FORTRAN
                program.
.cs 2 off
.cs 1 on
.docbegin
users should see
.italic 'Batch Processing'
for special cautions to be observed when reading data sets from a FORTRAN
program.
.docend
.cs 1 off

.* OPTION ACCESS-OPTIONS,DELETE
.optix DELETE
DELETE\\\\\\\\\\allows scratching of a data set either from WYLBUR or batch.
                An entire library must be scratched, not individual members.
                Does not allow reading or writing the data set.  This access
                level is especially pertinent for owners of private disks to
.cs 2 on
                keep unauthorized data sets off the volume.  (See the Batch
                Processing manual for further information.)\
.cs 2 off
.cs 1 on
.docbegin
keep unauthorized data sets off the volume.  (See
.italic 'Batch Processing'
for further information.)\
.docend
.cs 1 off

.* OPTION ACCESS-OPTIONS,WRITE
.optix WRITE
WRITE\\\\\\\\\\\allows reading, writing, or scratching from WYLBUR or batch,
                with no password required.  When you have WRITE access and
                enter a SAVE or SCRATCH command for a data set owned by
                another account, WYLBUR will issue a prompt to verify that
                access to another user's data set was intended.

.* OPTION ACCESS-OPTIONS,PASSWORD
.optix PASSWORD
PASSWORD\\\\\\\\allows reading from WYLBUR or batch; allows writing or
                scratching only if done from WYLBUR and after the data set
                owner's password is provided (in response to a "Password?"
                prompt or via a prior SET ACCOUNT gg.uuu PASSWORD command).
                In batch, PASSWORD access is equivalent to READ access.
                However, if you have PASSWORD access you may condense a data
                set using a WYLBUR CONDENSE command.

.* OPTION ACCESS-OPTIONS,UPDATE
.optix UPDATE
UPDATE\\\\\\\\\\allows reading and writing to, but not scratching of the data
                set.  With UPDATE access to a library, you may scratch an
                individual member but not an entire library.

.* OPTION ACCESS-OPTIONS,NONE
.optix NONE
NONE\\\\\\\\\\\\allows no access at all to the data set.

.* OPTION ACCESS-OPTIONS,EXTEND
.optix EXTEND
EXTEND\\\\\\\\\\when linked with one of the access options described above,
                EXTEND allows target users to pass on their access privileges
                (or lesser ones) to other users.  For example, a user to whom
                you give XX.YYY WRITE EXTEND access to your data set, could in
                turn give another user either READ or WRITE access to the data
                set.

.* OPTION LOG
.optix LOG
LOG\{WRITE|PROTECT|ALL|NONE}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the access logging to be set for the data set.  Only
                the owner of the data set may set or change the access
                logging.  LOG WRITE logs all write (including scratch, rename
                and data set protection changes) attempts to the data set.
                LOG PROTECT logs all changes in the data set protection
                status.  LOG ALL logs all read and write (including scratch,
                rename and data set protection changes) attempts to the data
                set.  LOG NONE turns off access logging for the data set.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Contact the Accounting office if you desire an access log
                report for your account.

.* OPTION LIST
.optix LIST
LIST\\\\\\\\\\\\causes the complete access status of the data set to be
                displayed in the command response, as if a SHOW PROTECT
                command had been issued.  The default is that no listing of
                access status is given.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\when specified with the LIST option, allow you to insert the
                system response to the SET PROTECT command into your active
                file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for a description of these
                options.
