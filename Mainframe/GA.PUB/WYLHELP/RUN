.* DESCRIPTION
The RUN command specifies that all or part of the active or EXEC file, which
may consist of one or more jobs, be submitted into the job input stream of the
central computer.

All JCL required to run the job must be contained in the file.  The first line
in the range must be a JOB statement, although the jobname and account may be
omitted; WYLBUR automatically generates the default values.  If you do not
specify the jobname, an 1-8 character string used to identify a job, WYLBUR
generates a jobname normally consisting of user and group codes of the
logged-on user and the WYLBUR job number (e.g., ABCGG244, where ABC is the
user code, GG is the group code and 244 is the WYLBUR job count).  Type HELP
SET JOB for information on how to change the way job names are generated.  With
the exception of comment cards and text inside single quotes, WYLBUR converts
all JCL statements to uppercase when submitting them to the job input stream.

.* SELECT 'RUN Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\is the range of lines of the active or EXEC file that is to be
                put into the job input stream.  This option must be first, if
                specified.

.* OPTION EXECUTE
.optix EXECUTE
EXECUTE\\\\\\\\\puts all or part of the EXEC file into the job input stream.

.* OPTION FROM
.optix FROM
FROM\dsname\\\\\specifies an external data set to be submitted (instead of the
                active or EXEC file).  Type HELP DSNAME for a description of
                dsname.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to run a job belonging to an account other
                than that of the logged-on user.  One form of this option is:
                ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a description
                of the account-options.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME
.optix ON
ON\volume\\\\\\\indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ If
                this option is not specified, the data set will be located via
                the system catalog (normally all data sets are cataloged).

.* OPTION TO
.optix TO
TO\{uuu|gg.uuu}\uuu directs printed output to the bin of user uuu in the
                logged on account's group.  gg.uuu directs printed output
                to the account gg.uuu.

.* OPTION MAIL
.optix MAIL
MAIL={'UPS\[AIR]/name/address1/.../address5|campus-address'}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\allows up to 200 pages of output to be routed either through
                campus mail, UPS ground mail, or UPS next-day air mail.  You
                can specify up to 120 characters of address information.
                Campus mail jobs that have printed by 3:00 pm are ready for
                campus mail pickup by 4:00 pm the same day.  UPS jobs that
                have printed by 2:00 pm Monday through Friday are picked up
                the same day by UPS.

.* OPTION NUMBERED,RNUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix NUMBERED
.optix RNUMBERED
.optix UNNUMBERED
.optix INTEGER
NUMBERED|RNUMBERED|UNNUMBERED|INTEGER
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\NUMBERED causes WYLBUR to put line numbers in columns 73-80 of
                the lines when they are submitted, if those columns are blank.
                If a line number greater than 9999.999 is used in the range
                being processed, the high-order digit will be truncated.
                RNUMBERED allows WYLBUR to put line numbers in columns 73-80
                even if it means replacing text originally in those columns.
                UNNUMBERED specifies that the WYLBUR line numbers are not to
                be put in columns 73-80 of the lines when they are submitted.
                INTEGER has the same meaning as RNUMBERED, except that the
                line number is an 8-digit integer.  The numbering option for
                RUN defaults to the option set with the SET JOB command;
                UNNUMBERED is the default setting for new accounts.  (Type
                HELP SET JOB NUMBERED UNNUMBERED for a description of NUMBERED
                and UNNUMBERED.)\

.* OPTION EJECT,NOEJECT
.optix EJECT
.optix NOEJECT
EJECT=n|NOEJECT\EJECT specifies the number of lines to be printed before the
                page is ejected.  This number must be between 0 and 255.  If
                EJECT is not specified, a page eject will occur after 60 lines
                of printing.  NOEJECT permits lines to be printed to the
                bottom of the page and over the page perforations when printing
                on impact printers.

.* OPTION JOBNAME
.optix JOBNAME
JOBNAME=jobname\specifies the complete jobname to be used.  The ID and PREFIX
                options will be ignored if JOBNAME is specified.

.* OPTION PREFIX
.optix PREFIX
PREFIX=prefix\\\overrides the default prefix (set by SET JOB) when the jobname
                is generated by WYLBUR.  This option is ignored if the JOBNAME
                option is also specified.

.* OPTION ID
.optix ID
ID={id|'id'}\\\\specifies a character string that will override the ggnnn
                portion of the WYLBUR-generated jobname.  This jobname has the
                form uuuggnnn, where uuu is the user code, gg is the group
                code and nnn is a WYLBUR-generated job number that is
                incremented each time a job is submitted.  The quoted 'id'
                form replaces the string ggnnn.  The unquoted id form overlays
                the string ggnnn character for character from left to right.
                This option is ignored if the JOBNAME option is also
                specified.

.* OPTION CLASS,C
.optix CLASS
CLASS=jobclass\\specifies that the job is to be run in the indicated execution
                class.  Current values for "jobclass" are:  C, B, E, P, F, L.
                Using this option will override any job class specification in
                the JCL.

.* OPTION PRIORITY,P,PR,PRTY
.optix PRIORITY
PRIORITY={p|(p,p)}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the priority at which the job is to run.  Valid
                priorities, in order of increasing priority, are:  LOW,
                STANDARD, and URGENT.  They may be abbreviated to L, S, U.  If
                only one value (e.g., PRIORITY=S) is specified, it will apply
                to the execution of the job.  If two values (e.g.,
                PRIORITY=(S,U)) are specified, the first value will apply to
                the execution of the job and the second value to the output of
                the job.  STANDARD priority is assumed if this option is not
                used.  URGENT priority will incur higher charges.  See
                DOC#RATES PUBLIC for a description of rates.

.* OPTION BLOCK
.optix BLOCK
BLOCK=block\\\\\specifies the time block when the job is to run.  Valid time
                blocks are:  PEAK, DAY, EVENING, NIGHT, WEEKEND and ANY.  They
                may be abbreviated to P, D, E, N, W and A.  ANY is the default.
                If only one block (e.g., BLOCK=W) is specified, it will apply
                to the execution of the job.  If two blocks are specified
                (e.g., BLOCK=(N,W)), the first block will apply to the
                execution of the job, while the second block will apply to the
                output of the job.  For the current time block schedule, see
                DOC#SCHEDULE PUBLIC.

.* OPTION DEST
.optix DEST
DEST=destination
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the destination for printing the output of the job.
                Valid destinations include:

                   LOCAL          Forsythe Hall
                   SELF           Forsythe Hall, self-service printer
                   RMTn           Remote work station n

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\If this option is not specified, the destination set with the
                SET OUTPUT command is used.  Type HELP SET OUTPUT DEST for a
                description of how to set a permanent default destination.

.* OPTION BIN,B
.optix BIN
BIN=nnn\\\\\\\\\causes the output to be routed to bin nnn.  If not specified,
                the bin number of the logged-on user will be assumed.

.* OPTION FORMS
.optix FORMS
FORMS=ffff\\\\\\specifies the form on which the job output should be printed,
                where ffff is a 1-4 character forms code.  See DOC#FORMS
                PUBLIC for a list of the valid codes.  If this option is not
                specified, the forms code set with the SET OUTPUT command is
                used.  Type HELP SET OUTPUT FORMS for a description of SET
                OUTPUT FORMS.

.* OPTION FLASH
.optix FLASH
.cs 2 on
FLASH=ffff\\\\\\specifies a "form flash" (electronic form).  See the manual,
                Using the Xerox 4090 Printer, for more information on form
                flashes.
.cs 2 off

.optbegin
FLASH=ffff\\\\\\specifies a "form flash" (electronic form).  See
.italic 'Using the Xerox 4635 Printer,'
for more information on form flashes.
.optend
.cs 1 off

.* OPTION LANDSCAPE
.optix LANDSCAPE
LANDSCAPE\\\\\\\requests printing in landscape orientation with the lines
                parallel to the long side of the page on the Xerox 4635 and
                other laser printers.

.* OPTION FCB
.optix FCB
.cs 2 on
FCB=cccc\\\\\\\\specifies a 1-4 character code to be used.  This option may
                only be specified for jobs in the output queue.  See the Batch
                Processing manual for a description of the various FCB (forms
                control buffer) codes.

.* OPTION CHARS
.optix CHARS
CHARS={a|(a,b[,c[,d]])}
.cs 2 on
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies one or multiple character sets.  See the manual,
                Using the Xerox 4090 Printer, for information on using
                multiple character sets.
.cs 2 off

.italic 'Using the Xerox 4090 Printer'
for information on using multiple character sets.
.optend
.cs 1 off

.* OPTION COPIES
.optix COPIES
COPIES=n\\\\\\\\specifies the number of copies of the job output to be
                printed.  The maximum number of copies is 254 and the default
                is one.

.* OPTION NOLIST
.optix NOLIST
NOLIST\\\\\\\\\\specifies that all output from the job is to be suppressed.
                This option should be used cautiously since the output
                suppression is unconditional.  That is, even if JCL errors
                occur, the listing will not be produced.  LIST is the default;
                it specifies that all job output be printed normally.

.* OPTION XHOLD,XH,NOXHOLD
.optix XHOLD
.optix NOXHOLD
XHOLD|NOXHOLD\\\XHOLD specifies that the job is to be placed in execution
                hold.  NOXHOLD, the default, specifies that the job is not to
                be placed in execution hold.

.* OPTION HOLD,H,NOHOLD
.optix HOLD
.optix NOHOLD
HOLD|NOHOLD\\\\\HOLD specifies that the job is to be placed in output hold.
                NOHOLD, the default, specifies that the job is not to be
                placed in output hold.

.* OPTION KEEP
.optix KEEP
KEEP\\\\\\\\\\\\returns a job to the system output queue after the job has
                printed, putting the kept output in output hold.  This option
                provides a backup for output that is difficult or costly to
                reproduce.  If a job is lost, the output can be released from
                output hold and reprinted.  When KEEP is specified, output
                remains in output hold for 48 hours, then is purged
                automatically.  The time remaining in output hold is not
                decremented during WEEKEND hours.

.* OPTION NOTIFY,NONOTIFY
.optix NOTIFY
.optix NONOTIFY
NOTIFY[=gg.uuu]|NONOTIFY
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\NOTIFY specifies that a notification message for the job is to
                be sent to the account of the logged-on user when the job ends
                execution.  If an account, in the form gg.uuu, is included
                with the NOTIFY option, the message will be sent to that
                account.  NONOTIFY, the default, specifies that a notify
                message is not requested for the job.

.* OPTION SYSAFF
.optix SYSAFF
SYSAFF={SYSA|SYSC|RLG}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\forces the job to run on either SYSA, SYSC, or the RLG
                machine.  The default is the machine you are logged onto.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the RUN command
                into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for a
                description of these options.

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\requests that all system responses be suppressed if the RUN
                command is successful.
