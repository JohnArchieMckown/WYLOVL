Active file

The active file is a temporary work and storage space in WYLBUR.  Whenever you
edit or change text, it must first be in your active file.  The USE command
copies a permanent WYLBUR file to the active file.  The GET command copies a
permanent ORVYL file to the active file.  Type HELP USE and HELP GET for
descriptions of these commands.

Any changes you make to text in your active file are not permanent:  they
will not be saved unless you use the SAVE command for a WYLBUR file or the PUT
command for an ORVYL file.  Type HELP SAVE and HELP PUT for descriptions of
these commands.

The command CLEAR ACTIVE clears the contents of your active file.  Type HELP
CLEAR ACTIVE for a description of the CLEAR ACTIVE command.

You may have multiple active files during one terminal session.  To open a new
empty active file, type OPEN.  To open a new active file from a data set, type
USE dsname KEEP, or type KEEP or K to the "OK to Clear" prompt.

To see your stack of active files, type SHOW ACTIVES.  Each active file has a
number associated with it.  To select a specific active file, type PICK
followed by the number of the active file.  Type HELP SHOW ACTIVES and HELP
PICK for information on these commands.
