.* DESCRIPTION
The REPLACE command allows you to replace the contents of the specified range
in the active file.  WYLBUR prompts with successive line numbers in the range;
allowing you to type the new contents of each line.  If you reply to a prompt
by pressing only the RETURN key, WYLBUR replaces that line with a completely
blank line.  If you specify the DITTO option, WYLBUR prompts you to replace
only one line and uses the new contents of that line to replace all other
lines in the range.

The short form of the REPLACE command consists of responding to the command
prompt by typing in a single line number, followed by a blank, and then the
contents of the line.  When NOSHORT mode is in effect, WYLBUR accepts this
short form only after a permission prompt.  (Type HELP SET MODES SHORT NOSHORT
for a description of the SHORT and NOSHORT modes.)\ Note that, in this form of
the REPLACE command, you cannot use the normal abbreviations (L and F) for the
symbolic line numbers LAST and FIRST.

.ix '@(BREAK)'
.ix 'BREAK key' 'use with @'
.ix key BREAK 'use with @'
After typing a line that you are replacing, you can type the @ sign and press
the BREAK key to MODIFY or EDIT that line.  MODIFY or EDIT is selected based
on the mode in effect.  (Type HELP SET MODES MODIFY EDIT for a description of
the MODIFY and EDIT modes.)\ When you are replacing a line and type @ and
press the BREAK key as the only response to the line number prompt, you can
MODIFY or EDIT the "old" copy of the line.  For example:

   Command> replace 5
   \\\\5.\\\> This is line five@***
   \\\\5.\\\\ This is line five
   \\\Mods\\>\\\\\\\\\ialtered
   \\\\5.\\\\ This is altered line five
   \\\Mods\\>
   Command> replace 5
   \\\\5.\\\> @***
   \\\\5.\\\\ This is altered line five
   \\\Mods\\>

.* SELECT 'REPLACE Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\is the range of lines that is to be replaced.  This option is
                required and must be specified first.  Type HELP RANGE for a
                description of range.

.* OPTION DITTO
.optix DITTO
DITTO\\\\\\\\\\\cause the contents of the first line replaced to be used as
                the replacement text for all the lines in the specified range.
                WYLBUR will prompt only with the first line number.

.* OPTION UPPER,UPLOW
.optix UPPER
.optix UPLOW
UPPER|UPLOW\\\\\when specified with REPLACE, provide a temporary override of
                the session case setting.  UPLOW causes WYLBUR to retain the
                case (upper, lower, or a mixture) of the text replaced.  UPPER
                causes WYLBUR to convert all lowercase letters to uppercase as
                the text is replaced.  (Type HELP SET TERMINAL CASE for a
                further description of case settings.)\

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\NOLIST is the default for this command.  If LIST is specified,
                each line is displayed before it is it is replaced.  (Type
                HELP LIST-OPTIONS for a description of the list-options.)\

.* OPTION LENGTH-OPTIONS,LENGTH,NOLENGTH
.optix length-options
length-options\\provide an override for the global length message (established
                with the SET LENGTH command).  If you specify NOLENGTH, the
                warning message about excess length will not be issued (unless
                the line is over 235 characters).  Type HELP LENGTH-OPTIONS
                for a description of the length options.
