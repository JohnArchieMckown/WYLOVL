.* DESCRIPTION
The SAVE command stores a copy of the current active or EXEC file as a data
set on a disk volume.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ WYLBUR
automatically selects a volume if you do not specify one.  In addition, WYLBUR
catalogs the data set you specify (enters its name and volume location in the
system catalog), so that you do not have to include a volume name in future
commands that reference that data set.

You can specify the REPLACE option to SAVE a new version of an existing data
set.  The USE command retrieves saved data sets.  Type HELP USE for a
description of the command.

You can use the SAVE command to save a new member into an existing library
or to replace an existing member in an existing library.  But you cannot use
the SAVE command to create a library.  Use the ALLOCATE command to do that
prior to using the SAVE command to save members into it.

The SAVE command also sets the PREFIX to the specified data set name.  (Type
HELP SET PREFIX for a description of the prefix.)\

.* SELECT 'SAVE Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION DSNAME
.optix dsname
dsname\\\\\\\\\\is the name you specify for the data set to be saved.  This
                option is required and must be specified first.  (Type HELP
                DSNAME for a description of dsname.)  If you are using Samson
                to download a file, include the drive designation on the
                filename: SAVE C:filename  .  Type HELP DSNAME for details.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR,PUBLIC
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to save a data set belonging to an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.  If this option is
                specified, you will be prompted for the password of the
                account before the command is executed.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME,TEMPORARY
.optix ON
.optix TEMPORARY
[ON\volume|TEMPORARY]
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ON volume indicates the disk volume or host computer where the
                data set is to be saved.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description
                of volume.)\ TEMPORARY allows you to save a data set on a
                temporary volume (e.g., SCR002).  (You are not charged for
                data sets saved on temporary volumes.  However, each morning
                all data sets on those volumes are scratched.)\ If the ON
                volume option or TEMPORARY option is not specified, WYLBUR
                automatically selects a permanent volume on which to save your
                data set.

.* OPTION NOSET,SET
.optix SET
.optix NOSET
NOSET|SET\\\\\\\NOSET tells WYLBUR not to set the prefix to the name of the
                data set specified in the SAVE command.  Hence, subsequent
                SAVE * commands will save to the old name, not to the name on
                the current SAVE command.  SET tells WYLBUR to set the prefix
                to the name of the data set specified in the SAVE command.
                SET is the default, and is seldom specified.


.* OPTION FORMAT-OPTIONS,EDIT,CARD,PRINT,RECFM,LRECL,BLKSIZE,NUMBERED,INTEGER,UNNUMBERED,SEQFLD
.optix format-options
[format-options]
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specify the format for the disk file.  When replacing an
                existing sequential data set the default is to keep the
                existing format. EDIT is the default for new files and is
                usually suitable.  You cannot specify a new format when saving
                into an existing library, unless the library is empty and does
                not yet have a format defined.  Type HELP FORMAT-OPTIONS for a
                description of these options.

.* OPTION EXECUTE
.optix EXECUTE
EXECUTE\\\\\\\\\causes the EXEC file to be saved.  If this option is not
                specified, the active file will be saved.  (Type HELP EXECUTE
                for a description of the EXEC file.)\

.* OPTION LINES,LINS
.optix LINES
LINES=range\\\\\cause the specified range of lines in the active or EXEC file
                to be saved.  If this option is not specified, the entire file
                will be saved.

.* OPTION STREAM
.optix STREAM
STREAM\\\\\\\\\\when using Samson only, the STREAM option removes hard
                carriage returns from the end of any unindented lines, so that
                unindented, consecutive lines are treated as one stream of
                text.  This is a useful option if you are downloading a text
                file to a word processing program on a microcomputer.

.* OPTION TRANSPARENT,DTRANSPARENT
.optix TRANSPARENT
.optix DTRANSPARENT
TRANSPARENT\\\\\specifies that the file is a non-text file being downloaded
                with the Samson program.  The TRANSPARENT option lets you
                transfer non-text files between microcomputers running Samson
                via the Data Center.  (But use DTRANSPARENT when downloading
                a non-text file to a Macintosh that originated on an IBM PC.)

DTRANSPARENT\\\\specifies that the file is a non-text file that originated
                on an IBM PC which is now being downloaded with the MacSamson
                program to a Macintosh computer.  In other situations when
                transferring non-text files, use the TRANSPARENT option.

.* OPTION TITLE
.optix TITLE
TITLE='text'\\\\permits a title of up to 42 characters when you are saving a
                member of a library.  The title must be enclosed in quotation
                marks.  It will be included, along with the member name, in
                the directory of the library and it will be displayed in
                responses from the SHOW DIRECTORY command.  The title remains
                in the directory even if you issue a SAVE command to replace
                the member, unless you change it by including a TITLE option
                in the command.

.* OPTION REPLACE
.optix REPLACE
REPLACE\\\\\\\\\must be specified to SAVE a new version of an existing
                sequential data set or an existing library member.  (Type HELP
                library for a description of library.)\ REPLACE will cause the
                old sequential data set to be erased before the new one is
                saved.  In the case of a library member, this option will
                cause the new member to be added to the library and the
                directory to be updated after the new member has been saved.
                The old member is not erased; it still uses space until the
                library is condensed.  (Type HELP CONDENSE for a description
                of the CONDENSE command.)\ If this option is omitted and the
                request is to SAVE a data set with an already existing name,
                WYLBUR will prompt "Replace [<dsname> on <volume>] (Yes/No)?".
                Responses other than YES or OK will cause the SAVE request to
                be aborted.

.* OPTION NOENQUEUE
.optix NOENQUEUE
NOENQUEUE\\\\\\\prevents the normal exclusive enqueue of the data set during
                the SAVE command.  This option is only effective for saving in
                a library.  It allows saving into a library that is being read
                (but not updated) by some other task, e.g., a batch job.  This
                option should be used with care because it could cause a loss of
                data integrity.

.* OPTION NOCATALOG,NOCATLG
.optix NOCATALOG
NOCATALOG\\\\\\\specifies that the data set is not to be cataloged;
                that is, placed in the system catalog, a directory of data
                sets.  NOCATALOG may be specified for non-SMS datasets.

.* OPTION KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR
.optix KEEP
KEEP\\\\\\\\\\\\opens a new, empty active file without clearing the old active
                file after the SAVE command is executed.

.* OPTION CLEAR,CLR
.optix CLEAR
CLEAR\\\\\\\\\\\may be used to erase the current active or EXEC file after the
                specified data set has been saved.  If the SAVE is
                unsuccessful, the file is not erased.

.* OPTION NOCONDENSE
.optix NOCONDENSE
NOCONDENSE\\\\\\suppresses the "Not enough space in <dsname>" and "Condense
                (Yes/No)?" messages when saving to a library that is full.  If
                the library is full, the data set will not be saved, and the
                ERROR variable will be set to TRUE, and the ERRID variable
                will be set to "LIBFULL".  This option is handy in EXEC files
                when the interruption of asking "OK to condense?" would not be
                appropriate.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the SAVE command
                into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for a
                description of these options.

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that all system responses be suppressed if the
                command is successful.

.cs 7 on
.* OPTION EXPDT
.optix EXPDT
EXPDT\\\\\\\\\\\The EXPDT option allows you to ignore any unexpired expiration
                (last access) date for the data set.
