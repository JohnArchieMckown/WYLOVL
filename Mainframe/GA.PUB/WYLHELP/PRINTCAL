.* DESCRIPTION
The PRINTCAL command prints a calendar for a specified month on a
LaserWriter printer.  When you issue the command, WYLBUR asks you
for the month and year you want, and then asks what LaserWriter
destination printer you want to print the calendar.  The default
printer is the self-service LaserWriter printer in Forsythe Hall,
but any local department LaserWriter printer that can be specified
in the DESTINATION option of a PRINT command may be used.

There are no options available on the command.  For those interested
in technical details, the Extended Exec file that PRINTCAL executes
can be examined in the dataset COMMANDS#PRINTCAL PUBLIC.
