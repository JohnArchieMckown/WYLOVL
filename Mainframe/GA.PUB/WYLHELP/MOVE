MOVE range {TO\line-number [BY\increment] [DITTO=d] [MERGE]|PLUS\[-]n}
     [REPLACE] [list-options]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The MOVE command copies a range of lines from one place in the active file to
another and deletes the old copy of the lines.  It functions exactly like the
COPY command with these exceptions:

   1.\The lines that were copied are deleted from their original location.

   2.\It is not possible to apply the MOVE command to an external or EXEC
      file.  The design of WYLBUR allows you to take destructive action only
      upon the current active file (unless you explicitly erase an entire
      external file).

   3.\The range must be specified, along with either the TO or the PLUS
      option.

.* SELECT 'MOVE Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\is the range of lines to be moved.  This option is required
                and must be specified first.  Type HELP RANGE for a
                description of range.

.* OPTION TO
.optix TO
TO\line-number\\specifies the beginning line number in the active file to
                which the range of lines is to be moved.  Either TO or PLUS
                must be specified with the MOVE command.

.* OPTION BY
.optix BY
BY\increment\\\\is the line number increment, or delta, by which the
                successive line numbers of the moved range are incremented.
                If not specified, the default value is selected.  (Type HELP
                DELTA for a description of delta.)\ If the value of delta,
                specified or default, would cause the moved lines to
                interleave existing lines in the file, WYLBUR automatically
                calculates a new value of delta so that interleaving does not
                take place.  (See the MERGE option for exceptions.)\

.* OPTION DITTO
.optix DITTO
DITTO=d\\\\\\\\\specifies that the copied lines are duplicated d times at the
                specified line number.  "d" may be any integer from 1 to
                32767 inclusive.

.* OPTION MERGE
.optix MERGE
MERGE\\\\\\\\\\\allows interleaving -- but no replacement -- of the moved
                lines with the existing lines.  The moved lines will not
                retain their original line numbers.

.* OPTION PLUS
.optix PLUS
PLUS\[-]n\\\\\\\specifies a positive or negative number that is to be added to
                each line number of the range to be moved.  (PLUS implies
                MERGE.)\

.* OPTION REPLACE
.optix REPLACE
REPLACE\\\\\\\\\specifies that the moved lines can replace and/or interleave
                existing lines.  WYLBUR will not change the increment when
                REPLACE is specified.

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\NOLIST is the default for this command.  LIST causes WYLBUR to
                list the line immediately preceding the line moved to, as well
                as each line as it is moved.  Type HELP LIST-OPTIONS for a
                description of the list-options.
