CATALOG dsname [account-options] ON\volume [QUIET]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The CATALOG command enters the name and volume location of the data set you
specify into the system catalog, a directory of data sets.  Note that CATALOG
is used infrequently since each time you issue a SAVE command, WYLBUR both
saves and catalogs the data set.

The UNCATALOG command removes the specified data set from the system catalog.
Data sets on SMS volumes cannot be uncataloged.

.* SELECT 'CATALOG Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION DSNAME
.optix dsname
dsname\\\\\\\\\\is the name of the data set to be cataloged.  This option is
                required.  Type HELP DSNAME for a description of dsname.  If
                the data set to be cataloged does not belong to the logged-on
                user, WYLBUR will respond "<dsname> is not yours." and then
                prompt "Password?".  If you reply with the correct password of
                the account whose data set is to be cataloged, the command
                will be executed; otherwise, the command will be aborted.

                this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.  If this option is
                specified, you will be prompted for the password of the
                account before the command is executed.
