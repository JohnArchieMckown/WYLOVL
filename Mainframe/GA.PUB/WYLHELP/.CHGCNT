.appendix 'Change Count Per Editing Command'
WYLBUR keeps track of changes to your active file and warns you of the number
of changes made if you try to clear the active file.  For example, the
command:

     SET MODES WARN=5

sets the flag so that, after 5 changes, WYLBUR issues a warning (WARN=30 is
the default at logon).  To turn off the warning mode, type:

     SET MODES NOWARN

You can override the warning mode setting by specifying WARN or NOWARN as an
option on any command that clears the active file.

WYLBUR updates the change count on completed commands as follows:

.options us=us
