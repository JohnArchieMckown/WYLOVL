WYLBUR was first implemented on the IBM 360/67 at the Campus Facility of the
then Stanford Computation Center in 1967.  In 1970, an MVT version of WYLBUR
written by the National Institutes of Health was installed on the IBM 360/91
at the SLAC Facility; there it was the object of substantial development
effort.  This extended version was then called SLAC/WYLBUR.

In 1973, SLAC/WYLBUR was converted to run under VS2 Release 1 (SVS) on the IBM
370/158 at Encina Hall, Stanford Campus.  Subsequently this version of WYLBUR,
Stanford WYLBUR, was enhanced and together with Stanford's timesharing monitor
ORVYL and terminal communications interface MILTEN, were introduced as the
Stanford Timesharing System.  In 1975 the system was upgraded to an IBM
370/168, which was converted to an IBM 3033 in 1979.  In 1981 the Stanford
Timesharing System was converted to an IBM 3081 to run under IBM's current
release of VS2, MVS, which was upgraded in 1983 to the current MVS/XA.

WYLBUR was extended considerably during these years.  A System News facility
was installed in 1978, and in 1980 an Electronic Mail facility was added.
Online HELP was installed in 1981.  Other extensions to WYLBUR include
supporting the Integrated Catalog Facility and adding Page mode editing in
1983, integrated microcomputer file transfer support using a program called
Samson and a spelling checker facility in 1984.  Now this complete interactive
service is offered to the users of Information Technology Services (ITS) on
the current &machine system.

Many enhancements to WYLBUR were originally designed and implemented at
Stanford.  Included among those who have made important contributions to WYLBUR
development are John Borgelt, Brian Cox, Mike Durket, Roger Fajman, Carol
Farlow, Bill Frazier, Parker Gillespie, Vicki Griffeth, John Halperin, Charley
Hoyt, Bruce Hunt, Steve Kunz, Carol Lennox, Rich Levitt, Jim Nisbet, Ed
Russell, and Joe Wells.  Additional extensions were originally implemented at
Columbia University, the National Institutes of Health, and Iowa State
University.

In 1981, the fifth edition of this reference manual was completely revised and
reorganized.  Eleanor Brown of Technical Support Services wrote and edited the
majority of the additions and revisions and was responsible for the
reorganization of the manual.  Lincoln Ong of Operations Technical Support
wrote and edited some commands, prepared three appendices, and was responsible
for the formatting of the manual, including the overwhelming job of preparing
the index.  Invaluable technical assistance was provided by Jim Nisbet, who
displayed amazing patience and availability.  Technical and editorial review
comments were provided by:  Ruth Chase, Ronald Clemens, June Genis, John Klemm,
Mark Lawrence, Shirley Melen, Anne Seeley, and Jim Stosick.

This sixth edition of the reference manual was revised to include a new
version of Page WYLBUR, the new full-screen text-editing mode.  Lincoln Ong of
the Systems Group wrote and edited commands in Part II and formatted the
manual.  Anne Hotchkiss of the Systems Group wrote and edited the additions
and revisions in Part I.
