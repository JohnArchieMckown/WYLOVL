information about the EXEC file to the person who is executing it.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION EXPRESSION
.optix expression
expression\\\\\\specifies the expression to be displayed.  You can specify any
                valid expression (e.g., WRITE (2+2) or WRITE 'Hello').

.* OPTION NONL
.optix NONL
NONL\\\\\\\\\\\\means "no new line" and specifies that WYLBUR is to display
                the expression without issuing a new line (i.e., carriage
                return or line feed).  Either the command prompt or the next
                information to be displayed will appear on the same line as
                the expression.

.* OPTION NOMODEL,TRANSPARENT
.optix NOMODEL
.optix TRANSPARENT
NOMODEL|TRANSPARENT
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\NOMODEL specifies that the data to be written should not be
                interpreted as containing model terminal sequences.  This is
                useful when the data contains escape sequences.  TRANSPARENT
                specifies that the data to be written should be treated as
                straight binary data (without being translated to text).

.* OPTION FORCE
.optix FORCE
FORCE\\\\\\\\\\\writes output to the terminal even if SET TERMINAL QUIET is in
                effect for the session at the moment.  (Type HELP SET TERMINAL
                QUIET for details.)\

.* OPTION ATTN
.optix ATTN
ATTN=line-number
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies a line-number WYLBUR is to execute next, if whoever
                is using the EXEC file presses the BREAK key to interrupt the
                WRITE statement.  Symbolic line numbers are acceptable.  If
                the ATTN option is not used, this condition causes an EXEC
                BREAK.  As a safeguard against having an EXEC file that cannot
                be interrupted, the ATTN option will not be honored when the
                BREAK key is pressed more than once.
