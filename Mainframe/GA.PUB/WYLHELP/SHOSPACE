.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW SPACE command displays the total amount of space (in tracks) used by
your account on the public volumes and the maximum amount of space your
account is permitted.  To determine the space used and the maximum space
permitted for an account other than that of the logged-on user, you must
include the account in the command (e.g., SHOW SPACE NR.CAR).

This space value is updated when disk accounting is run (usually
between midnight and 6 a.m.).

Another command, SHOW TRACKS, displays the number of free tracks of space that
are available for storage on a specified disk volume.  Type HELP SHOW TRACKS
for a description.
