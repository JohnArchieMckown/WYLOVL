.* DESCRIPTION
The IF statement evaluates an expression in parentheses.  The expression may
be a simple boolean variable or two expressions linked by a relational
operator (which together evaluate to a boolean TRUE or FALSE.) If the result
is true, WYLBUR executes the command following the parentheses.  If the result
is false, WYLBUR skips the command without further inspection.
