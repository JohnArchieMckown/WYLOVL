.* DESCRIPTION
The CANCEL command immediately terminates the execution of a job.  The job is
placed in the output queue and any output generated up to the time you issued
the CANCEL command will be processed.  If you specify the DUMP option, and a
SYSUDUMP or SYSABEND DD statement has been included in your job, an ABEND dump
will be generated.  If you specify the PURGE option, execution will be
terminated and output will not be processed.

When you issue a CANCEL command for a job that is not in execution, the
command is rejected and an error message is displayed.  To terminate a job
regardless of what processing phase it is in, use the PURGE command with the
CANCEL option.
