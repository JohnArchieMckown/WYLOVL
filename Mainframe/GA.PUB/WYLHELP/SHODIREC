.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW DIRECTORY command displays an alphabetical list of member names
(directory) in the specified library.  (Type HELP LIBRARY for a description of
library.)\ The directory of a library includes the date and time that each
member was saved, along with the account that created the member and an
optional title.  (Type HELP SAVE TITLE for a description of how to specify the
title.)\

The SHOW DIRECTORY command displays only the member names and titles, unless
the ALL or the HEX option is included.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION FOR,IN
.optix FOR
FOR\library\\\\\specifies the name of the library whose member names are to be
                listed.  If omitted, the name of the library is from the
                current setting of SET LIBRARY.  (Type HELP SET LIBRARY for a
                description of SET LIBRARY.)\

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR,PUBLIC
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to display the directory of a library
                belonging to an account other than that of the logged-on user.
                One form of this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP
                ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a description of the account-options.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME
.optix ON
ON\volume\\\\\\\specifies the volume where the specified library is located.
                (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ If this
                option is not specified, the system catalog, an index of data
                sets, will be searched for the library name and volume
                location.  (All libraries are automatically cataloged when
                they are set up, unless you specify otherwise.)\

.* OPTION LIKE
.optix LIKE
LIKE\{string|*}\string specifies a member name to match all member names in
                the library to be displayed.  If * is specified instead, the
                current member name from SET PREFIX is used.  (Type HELP SET
                PREFIX for a description of prefix.)\ string may consist of an
                alphabetic character, a string of characters, or a member
                name.

.* OPTION FROM
.optix FROM
FROM\{string1|*}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\string1 specifies the first member name in the library, the
                lower limit, to start the display list.  If * is specified
                instead, the current member name from SET PREFIX is used.
                (Type HELP SET PREFIX for a description of prefix.)\ If the
                FROM option is omitted, the displayed list starts from the
                first member in the library.  string1 may consist of an
                alphabetic character, a string of characters, or a member
                name.

.* OPTION TO
.optix TO
TO\{string2|*}\\string2 specifies the last member name in the library, the
                upper limit, to end the display list.  If * is specified
                instead, the current member name from SET PREFIX is used.
                (Type HELP SET PREFIX for a description of prefix.)\ If the TO
                option is omitted, the displayed list ends with the last
                member in the library.  string2 may consist of an alphabetic
                character, a string of characters, or a member name.

.* OPTION BLOCKS
.optix BLOCKS
BLOCKS\\\\\\\\\\displays the number of directory blocks in the library,
                and shows how many of them are used.
.* OPTION TABLE
.optix TABLE
TABLE\\\\\\\\\\\displays as many member names (without titles) as will fit
                on a line, instead of displaying one member name per line.

.* OPTION ALL,OLD,NEW
.optix ALL
.optix OLD
.optix NEW
ALL [OLD|NEW]\\\causes WYLBUR to display not only each member name and title
                but also the time and date each member was saved and the
                account under which it was most recently saved.  The OLD
                format, the default until July 15, 1995, shows the dates with a
                two-digit century; the NEW format, the default after July 15,
                1995, shows the dates differently, using a four-digit century
                field.  The NEW format also shows the creation date (when
                known) and the column labelling is slightly different.  Note:
                the OLD format incorrectly labels the column of update dates as
                creation dates, a problem fixed with the NEW format.

.* OPTION HEX
.optix HEX
HEX\\\\\\\\\\\\\displays each directory entry in its internal (hexadecimal)
                format.  This is useful for load module libraries.

.* OPTION SCRATCH
.optix SCRATCH
SCRATCH\\\\\\\\\offers you the option of scratching members of the library.
                After the name of the member has been listed, WYLBUR prompts
                "Scratch (Yes/No)?". A positive response (YES, Y, or OK)
                causes the listed member to be scratched.  Any other response
                is interpreted as a negative response and WYLBUR goes on to
                list the name of the next member.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the SHOW DIRECTORY
                command into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for
                a description of these options.  This option cannot be
                specified with the SCRATCH option.
