Jobid is an option of the ALTER, CANCEL, FETCH, HOLD, LOCATE, JPRINT, PURGE,
and RELEASE commands.  You can use it to specify the jobs to which the command
applies.

.ix jobstem 'as jobid'
jobstem\\\\is a 1-8 character string, not enclosed in apostrophes, that is
           compared with all jobnames in the system (whether they belong to
           you or not).  The command will affect all jobs whose names match
           the jobstem for as many characters as given in the jobstem.

.ix jobname 'as jobid'
'jobname'\\is a 1-8 character string enclosed in apostrophes.  This form is
           similar to the jobstem except that the command will affect only
           those jobs whose names match the given string exactly.  Since
           jobnames have at most 8 characters, an 8 character string without
           apostrophes (a jobstem) is equivalent to the same string with
           apostrophes (a 'jobname').

.ix jobnumber 'as jobid'
jobnumber\\is the job number assigned by the system when the job is submitted.
           It will be a number between 1 and 99999.  This is one way to specify
           a single, unique job.

.ix * 'as jobid'
.ix * 'as current jobnumber'
*[-n]\\\\\\if the command is submitted through WYLBUR, * is equivalent to the
           last job submitted during the current terminal session.  *-n, where
           n is an integer, refers to a previous job regardless of jobnames
           used.  For example:

              Command> print
              JOB01234 UUUGG011 AWAITING PRINT...
              Command> print jobname=jim
              JOB01236 JIM      AWAITING PRINT...
              Command> locate *
              JOB01236 JIM      AWAITING PRINT...
              Command> locate *-1
              JOB01234 UUUGG011 AWAITING PRINT...

           For commands passed to JES2 using the JOBCTRL program, * is the job
           issuing the command, and *-n can be used to specify any jobname,
           formed by subtracting n from the current jobname as long as that

.ix & 'as jobid'
.ix &uuu 'as jobid'
&[uuu]\\\\\& refers to the set of jobs currently in the system running under
           the account of the logged-on user.  &uuu refers to the set of jobs
           currently in the system running under the logged-on group but with
           user initials uuu.

Job specifications may be combined on one command by separating each job
specification with a comma and surrounding the entire list in parentheses.
.pa
The surrounding parentheses may be omitted if the job specifications are all
job numbers.  For example:

   Command> release (L43C6327,'L43X',*,*-1)
   Command> locate 5299,8221,9223,8224
