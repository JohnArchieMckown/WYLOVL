.* DESCRIPTION
System Variables are storage locations for values that are either provided
by WYLBUR or specified by you with a SET command.  The information they
contain can be used anywhere in WYLBUR, including within an EXEC file.

Following is a list of the system variables and, if applicable, the commands
used to establish and display the value.  If you use one of these variable
names for a local variable, you can still access the system variable by
prefixing the name with "SYS." (for example, SYS.DATE).

(The SHOW VALUE command displays the value of any system variable.)\ Except
where noted below, a system variable can be abbreviated to its first three
characters.

Note: Online, for individual variable descriptions, type "HELP SYSTEM
VARIABLE varname", replacing "varname" with the appropriate variable name.
