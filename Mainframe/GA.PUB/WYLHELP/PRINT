.* DESCRIPTION
The PRINT command causes a batch job to be prepared and submitted to the JES2
output queue.  This job causes the active file, the EXEC file, or an external
data set to be submitted for printing on a printer.

.ix 'OPTIONS: line' 'with PRINT Command'
If the first line or lines in the range to be printed begin with "OPTIONS:",
then the remaining text in those "OPTIONS:" lines can specify PRINT options
that should be used to print the remaining lines of text.  The "OPTIONS:" line
itself does not get printed.  A sample "OPTIONS:" line might be:
.'ix ';'

   \\\\1.\\\\ OPTIONS: INDENT=24 TITLE='CHART' CHARS=TN12; comments

.* SELECT 'PRINT Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the range of lines to be printed.  If a range is not
                specified, the entire active file will be printed.  If this
                option is used, it must be specified first.  Type HELP RANGE
                for a description of range.

.* OPTION EXECUTE
.optix EXECUTE
EXECUTE\\\\\\\\\specifies that all or part of the EXEC file is to be listed.
                If this option is not specified, all or part of the active
                file is listed.

.* OPTION FROM
.optix FROM
FROM\dsname\\\\\specifies an external data set to be submitted for printing
                (instead of the active or EXEC file).

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME
.optix ON
ON\volume\\\\\\\indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ If
                this option is not specified, the data set will be located
                via the system catalog (all datasets are cataloged unless you
                specify otherwise when creating them).

.* OPTION FORMAT-OPTIONS,EDIT,CARD,PRINT,LRECL
.optix format-options
format-options\\allow you to specify the record length and the treatment of
                WYLBUR line numbers in the data set to be used.  (Type HELP
                FORMAT-OPTIONS for a description of these options.)\

.* OPTION TO
.optix TO
TO\{uuu|gg.uuu}\uuu specifies that the printed output is to be sent to the bin
                of the user in the logged-on user's group.  gg.uuu specifies
                that the printed output is to be sent to the bin of the
                account indicated.

.* OPTION MAIL
.optix MAIL
MAIL={'UPS\[AIR]/name/address1/.../address5'|'campus-address'}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\allows up to 200 pages of output to be routed either through
                campus mail, UPS ground mail, or UPS next-day air mail.  You
                can specify up to 120 characters of address information.
                Campus mail jobs that have printed by 3:00 pm are ready for
                campus mail pickup by 4:00 pm the same day.  UPS jobs that
                have printed by 2:00 pm Monday through Friday are picked up
                the same day by UPS.

.* OPTION DOCUMENT
.optix DOCUMENT
DOCUMENT\\\\\\\\is a short form for specifying the options:

                   NONUMBERED,FORMS=BOND

.* OPTION MEMO
.optix MEMO
MEMO\\\\\\\\\\\\is a short form for specifying the options:

                   UNNUMBERED,INDENT=10,EJECT=56,FORMS=BOND,FLASH=MEMO,
                   FCB=MEM6,CHARS=TN10

                This causes your output to be printed on bond paper that is
                set up like Stanford University interoffice memo paper.

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\LIST, the default for this command, lists the text and line
                numbers of the specified range.  The UNNUMBERED option lists
                only the text of the lines in the range and shifts the text to
                the left.  NOTEXT suppresses printing of the text and lists
                only the numbers.  NONUMBERED lists the text only and replaces
                the line number with blanks.  For a description of all the
                list options, type HELP LIST-OPTIONS.

.* OPTION HEX,MIXED
.optix HEX
.optix MIXED
HEX|MIXED\\\\\\\HEX specifies that the listing be in hexadecimal
                representation.  MIXED causes all nonprinting (control)
                characters to be displayed in their EBCDIC hexadecimal format,
                enclosed in angle brackets.  For example, <270C> represents
                the two characters X'27' and X'0C'.

.* OPTION FORMATTED,UNFORMATTED
.optix UNFORMATTED
UNFORMATTED\\\\\prints any special WYLBUR formatting instructions like those
                for bold, italic, and underlining instead of executing them.
                FORMATTED is the default.

.* OPTION CC,MC
.optix CC
.optix MC
CC|MC\\\\\\\\\\\CC or MC causes the character in column 1 of each line in the
                range to be treated as a printer control character.  MC is
                valid only for files with machine control (MC) characters such
                as those normally created by some of the IBM assemblers or
                compilers or fetched using the MC parameter.

.* OPTION NOCC,NOMC
.optix NOCC
.optix NOMC
NOCC|NOMC\\\\\\\overrides the CC and MC options.  This option is only useful
                if either CC or MC is included in in an OPTIONS: line in the
                data set you want printed.

.* OPTION TRC
.optix TRC
TRC\\\\\\\\\\\\\causes the character in column 1 (or column 2 if CC is
                specified) to be treated as a table reference character.  If
                you specify multiple CHARS on a PRINT command, a 0 or a blank
                in the TRC column indicates the first font, a 1 the second,
                etc.

.* OPTION COLUMNS,COLS
.optix COLUMNS
COLUMNS=m[/n]\\\will cause only columns m through n of a line to be listed.
                If the COLUMNS option is not specified, m defaults to column
                1; n to column 235.  (The actual number of columns that can be
                printed depends on the options: FORMS, CHARS, and
                list-options.)\

.* OPTION MARKER
.optix MARKER
MARKER=c\\\\\\\\causes a page eject at any point in the range where there is a
                marker character in column 1 (c is any character).  Lines with
                the marker character in column 1 will not be printed.  Enclose
                the marker character in quotation marks or apostrophes if it is
                a lowercase letter or one of these characters:  ( ) " ' ,

.* OPTION INDENT
.optix INDENT
INDENT=n\\\\\\\\inserts n blanks at the left of each listed line.  If INDENT=0
                is specified, printer control characters are assumed to be in
                column 1 of each line of the file and the UNNUMBERED
                list-option is assumed.  CC characters are expected unless the
                MC option is also used.  CC or MC alone may be used to get
                numbered listings with carriage control.

.* OPTION DOUBLE,TRIPLE
.optix DOUBLE
.optix TRIPLE
DOUBLE|TRIPLE\\\produce a listing with double or triple spacing, respectively.
                Single spacing is the default.

.* OPTION EJECT,NOEJECT
.optix EJECT
.optix NOEJECT
EJECT=n|NOEJECT\EJECT specifies the number of lines to be printed before the
                page is ejected.  This number must be between 0 and 255.  If
                EJECT is not specified, a page eject will occur after 60 lines
                of printing.  NOEJECT permits lines to be printed to the
                bottom of the page and over the page perforations when printing
                on impact printers.

.* OPTION BACK
.optix BACK
BACK\\\\\\\\\\\\causes lines with backspace characters to be printed as they
                would be on a terminal.  This option is independent of the SET
                TERMINAL {BACK|NOBACK} options.

.* OPTION DARK
.optix DARK
DARK[=n]\\\\\\\\produces an offline listing in which each line is printed two
                (or n if n is specified) times.  Sometimes overprinting can
                facilitate better reproduction.  This option reduces printing
                speed considerably and increases your lines-printed charge by
                n.  (This option is valid only for impact printers.)\

.* OPTION JOBNAME
.optix JOBNAME
JOBNAME=name\\\\specifies a 1-8 character string to replace the complete
                jobname generated by WYLBUR when the job is submitted for
                printing.  The ID and PREFIX options will be ignored if
                JOBNAME is specified.

.* OPTION PREFIX
.optix PREFIX
PREFIX=prefix\\\is a character string from 1 to 8 characters used to overlay
                the WYLBUR-generated jobname, character by character, from
                left to right.  This jobname has the form uuuggnnn, where uuu
                is the user code, gg is the group code and nnn is a
                WYLBUR-generated job number that is incremented each time a
                job is submitted.  This option is ignored if the JOBNAME
                option is also specified.

.* OPTION ID
.optix ID
ID={id|'id'}\\\\is a character string used to override the ggnnn portion of
                the WYLBUR-generated jobname.  The jobname has the form
                uuuggnnn, where uuu is the user code, gg is the group code and
                nnn is a WYLBUR-generated job number that is incremented each
                time a job is submitted.  The quoted 'id' form replaces the
                string ggnnn.  The unquoted id form overlays the string ggnnn
                character for character from right to left.  This option is
                ignored if the JOBNAME option is also specified.

.* OPTION TITLE
.optix TITLE
TITLE='title'\\\permits a title of up to 72 characters to be printed on the
                output after the JCL and before the listing of the file.  The
                first 20 characters will also appear on the job header and
                trailer sheets.

.* OPTION HEADER
.optix HEADER
HEADER='header'\permits a title of up to 20 characters to be printed on the
                job header and trailer sheets of your output.  If this option
                is specified with the TITLE option, the HEADER takes the place
                of the TITLE on the header and trailer sheets of your output.

.* OPTION UPLOW
.optix UPLOW
UPLOW\\\\\\\\\\\specifies, for impact printers only, upper- and lowercase
                printed output.  UPLOW is equivalent to SYSOUT=D.

.* OPTION FICHE
.optix FICHE
FICHE\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that job output be directed to microfiche rather
                than to a printer.

.* OPTION SYSOUT
.optix SYSOUT
.cs 2 on
SYSOUT=s\\\\\\\\specifies SYSOUT output classes.  See the Batch Processing
                manual for a list of available SYSOUT classes.

for a list of available SYSOUT classes.
.optend
.cs 1 off

.* OPTION PRIORITY,P,PR,PRTY
.optix PRIORITY
PRIORITY=priority
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the priority at which the job is to be printed.
                Valid values, in order of increasing priority, are:  LOW,
                STANDARD, or URGENT.  They may be abbreviated to L, S, U.
                STANDARD priority is assumed if this option is not used.
                URGENT priority will incur higher charges.  See DOC#RATES
.cs 2 on
                PUBLIC for a description of rates.  See the Batch Processing
                manual for a description of job priorities.

.* OPTION BLOCK
.optix BLOCK
BLOCK=block\\\\\specifies the time block when the job can be printed.  Valid
                time blocks are:  PEAK, DAY, EVENING, NIGHT, WEEKEND and ANY.
                They may be abbreviated to P, D, E, N, W and A.  ANY is the
                default.  For the current time block schedule, see DOC#SCHEDULE
                PUBLIC.

.* OPTION DESTINATION
.optix DEST
DEST=destination
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the destination for printing the output of the job.
                Valid destinations include:

                   FORSYTHE       Forsythe Hall
                   LOCAL          Forsythe Hall
                   LWSELF         Self Service LaserWriter printer
                   SELF           Forsythe Hall, self-service printer
                   RMTn           Remote work station n

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\If this option is not specified, the destination set with the
                SET OUTPUT command is used.  Type HELP SET OUTPUT DEST for a
                description of how to set a permanent default destination.

.* OPTION BIN,B
.optix BIN
BIN=nnn\\\\\\\\\causes the output to be routed to bin nnn.  If not specified,
                the bin number of the logged-on user is assumed.

.* OPTION FORMS
.optix FORMS
FORMS=ffff\\\\\\specifies the form on which the output should be printed,
                where ffff is a 1-4 character forms code.  USE DOC#FORMS
                PUBLIC for a list of the valid codes.  If this option is not
                specified, the forms code set with the SET OUTPUT PRTFORMS
                command is used, or, if none, the forms code set by SET OUTPUT
                FORMS is used.  Type HELP SET OUTPUT FORMS for a description
                of SET OUTPUT FORMS.

.* OPTION FLASH
.optix FLASH
.cs 2 on
FLASH=ffff\\\\\\specifies a forms flash overlay.  BAR4 prints four grey bars
                per inch in landscape mode on the 4090 printer.  FLASH=MEMO
                prints on the 4090 and departmental printers that can interpret
                PostScript commands, using a Stanford University Memo overlay.
.cs 2 off
.cs 1 on
.optbegin
FLASH=ffff\\\\\\specifies a forms flash overlay.  See
.italic 'Using the Xerox 4090 Printer'
for more information on forms flashes.
.optend
.cs 1 off

.* OPTION PFORMAT
.optix PFORMAT
PFORMAT=ffff\\\\requests special 4090 page formats.  Specifying PFORMAT
                designates the character set to be used and the vertical lines
                per inch spacing, thus overriding any FCB or CHARS option
                which may also specified.  Type HELP PFORMAT for a list of
                available page formats or "modes".

.* OPTION PORTRAIT
.optix PORTRAIT
PORTRAIT\\\\\\\\requests printing in portrait orientation with the lines
                parallel to the short side of the page on the Xerox 4635 and
                other laser printers.  This is the default for most forms, but
                some PFORMATs and form choices set landscape instead.

.* OPTION LANDSCAPE
.optix LANDSCAPE
LANDSCAPE\\\\\\\requests printing in landscape orientation with the lines
                parallel to the long side of the page on the Xerox 4635 and
                other laser printers.  This is the default for FORMS=GBAR
                and for PFORMATs that begin with an "L" (such as L132).

.* OPTION FCB
.optix FCB
FCB=cccc\\\\\\\\specifies a 1-4 character code to be used.  This option may
.cs 2 on
                only be specified for jobs in the output queue.  See the Batch
                Batch Processing manual for a description of the various FCB
                (forms control buffer) codes.

.* OPTION CHARS
.optix CHARS
CHARS=a|(a,b[,c[,d]])
.cs 2 on
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies one or multiple character sets.  See the manuals
                'Using the Xerox 4090 Printer' and 'Printing Data Center Output
                in Your Office' for information on using multiple character
                sets.

.cs 2 off

or the manual
.italic 'Printing Data Center Output in Your Office'
for information on using multiple character sets.
.optend
.cs 1 off

.* OPTION COPIES
.optix COPIES
COPIES=nn\\\\\\\allows up to 254 copies to be made of the output.  If this
                option is not specified, one copy will be printed.

.* OPTION DUPLEX,NODUPLEX
.optix DUPLEX
.optix NODUPLEX
DUPLEX|NODUPLEX\DUPLEX requests printing on both sides of the paper.
                NODUPLEX requests printing only on the front.  The default
                is NODUPLEX.  NODUPLEX is useful as an option on the PRINT
                command when you need to override DUPLEX appearing in an
                "Options:" line at the start of the data set being printed.
                The DUPLEX option is ignored unless output is printed on the
                4635 printer, or other laser printers that support duplex.

.* OPTION MANUAL
.optix MANUAL
MANUAL\\\\\\\\\\prints every page of the job through the manual feeder.  This
                is useful for printing on special forms without refilling the
                paper tray.  This option works only on LaserJet and
                LaserWriter printers.

.* OPTION FMANUAL
.optix FMANUAL
FMANUAL\\\\\\\\\prints the first page of a job on paper fed through the
                manual feeder.  This is useful if you want to print only the
                first page of a letter on letterhead.  If you are printing
                multiple copies, the first page of each copy prints through
                the manual feeder.  This option only works on LaserJet or
                LaserWriter printers.

.* OPTION NOSEPARATOR
.optix NOSEPARATOR
NOSEPARATOR\\\\\suppresses the job header page between jobs.  Do not use this
                option for the printers in Forsythe Hall, as there is no way
                of knowing that your job will be dispatched correctly without
                the job header and trailer pages.  Use it only for a printer
                that you maintain in your office.  It is usually abbreviated
                to NOSEP.

.* OPTION HOLD,H
.optix HOLD
HOLD\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that the job is to be placed into output hold.

.* OPTION KEEP
.optix KEEP
KEEP\\\\\\\\\\\\returns a job to the system output queue after the job has
                printed, putting the kept output in output hold.  This option
                provides a backup for output that is difficult or costly to
                reproduce.  If a job is lost, the output can be released from
                output hold and reprinted.  When KEEP is specified, output
                remains in output hold for 48 hours, then is purged
                automatically.  The time remaining in output hold is not
                decremented during WEEKEND hours.

.* OPTION POSTSCRIPT
.optix POSTSCRIPT
POSTSCRIPT\\\\\\specifies that the file to be printed is a PostScript command
                file that should be interpreted prior to being printed. This
                option lets you upload PostScript versions of documents from
                your microcomputer so that the document can be printed on a
                PostScript printer.  Many departmental printers can print
                PostScript; so can the self-service LaserWriter in Forsythe
                Hall (DEST=LWSELF) and its non-self-service counterpart
                (DEST=LWDISP).  The Xerox 4635 cannot interpret PostScript
                files.


.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the PRINT command
                into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for a
                description of these options.

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\requests that all system responses be suppressed if the PRINT
                command is successful.
