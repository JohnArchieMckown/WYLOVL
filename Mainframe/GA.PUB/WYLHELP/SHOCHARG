SHOW CHARGES [gg.uuu] [INTERNAL] [collect-options]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW CHARGES command displays information about the charges accrued to
your account as of the last time the accounting programs were run (usually
between midnight and 6 a.m.\each day).

The SHOW CHARGES command response includes the month-to-date charges, as well
as the year-to-date charges.  The date when the charges were last calculated
is also shown along with the dollar amount added at that time.  In addition,
if the account has been suspended the reason appears in the response (e.g.,
expired, over budget).

The SHOW AMESSAGE (or SHOW AMSG) command displays any accounting message that
appears in the SHOW CHARGES command response.
