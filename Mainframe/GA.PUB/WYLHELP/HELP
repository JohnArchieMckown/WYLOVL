.* DESCRIPTION
The HELP command provides information about the syntax, function, and options
of most WYLBUR commands.  In addition, it provides definitions of terminology
(e.g., HELP VOLUME, HELP DSNAME) and aids to further assistance (e.g., HELP
PHONES, HELP CONSULTING).

If you type a command without options (e.g., HELP SHOW DIRECTORY), WYLBUR
displays the syntax and the general description of the command and prompts for
any specific options you want more information about.  In addition, you can
precede a WYLBUR command that includes options with the word HELP, and WYLBUR
gives as much specific information about the command as it can.  For example:

     HELP SHOW DIRECTORY LIKE FOO

WYLBUR displays the syntax and general description for the SHOW DIRECTORY
command, as well as a description of the LIKE option.  WYLBUR looks for clues
in what you type, rather than insisting on a specific syntax.  Consider
another example:

     HELP PRINT 50/L UNN FORMS BOND DUPLEX

WYLBUR displays the syntax of the PRINT command and then describes information
about the UNN, FORMS and DUPLEX options.  Of course, you can also get exactly
the same information by typing the following:

     HELP PRINT UNN FORMS DUPLEX

Use the HELP command with a collect-option to put the information you specify
into your active file.  Two examples follow:

     HELP 'PRINT UNN FORMS DUPLEX' COLLECT
     HELP 'PHONES' COLLECT

You must enclose the specified information in apostrophes or quotation marks,
as shown in the example above.

.* OPTION COMMAND
.optix command
command\\\\\\\\\is the name of a command (abbreviations are acceptable).  Note
                that commands beginning with SET, SHOW, or CLEAR should be
                specified in their entirety (e.g., HELP SET JOB, HELP SHOW
                OPTIONS).

.* OPTION OPTION
.optix option
option\\\\\\\\\\is the name of a collection of options (e.g., list-options).
                When a collection of options is specified with HELP, the
                hyphen must be included between the name of the options and
                the word "options"; for example:

                   HELP LIST-OPTIONS

                displays information about the list-options.

.* OPTION TOPIC
.optix topic
topic\\\\\\\\\\\is the name of a general system topic for which you need
                information (e.g., PHONES, NEWS, LIBRARY).  Type HELP TOPICS

                placed in your active file, for example:

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The information you specify must be enclosed in apostrophes or
                quotation marks.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for a description
