.* DESCRIPTION
The DECLARE statement declares a variable or set of variables as being of a
certain type (number, string, or boolean).  Unless the variable is an array,
variable declaration is optional.  If a variable is not declared, its type is
determined by its first usage.

When a variable is declared as a number, its value is initialized to 0.
String variables are initialized to '' (a null string), and boolean variables
to FALSE.

All arrays must be declared before being used.  For example, the statement

     DECLARE NUMBER FOO[4]

declares an array of number variables, with up to four occurrences.  To
display the contents of the array, use the SHOW ARRAY command (SHOW ARRAY
FOO).
