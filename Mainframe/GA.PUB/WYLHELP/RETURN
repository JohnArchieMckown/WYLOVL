RETURN [(variable-list)]

.* DESCRIPTION
(** Extended EXECs only **)
The RETURN statement ends the execution of a PROC in an Extended EXEC and
optionally returns the values of some variables that were passed on
invocation.

Variables do not need to be returned in any specific order, and you do not
need to return every variable that was passed to the procedure.  You can have
multiple RETURN statements in a PROC; the first one executed will end the
PROC.  The XRETURN statement is similar but returns from an entire XPROC;
type HELP XRETURN for more information.

                in any specific order.
