.* DESCRIPTION
The RECATALOG command enters the specified data set in the system catalog;
whether it was already cataloged or not.  RECATALOG is also allowed as a
option of the SAVE command.

The CATALOG command also enters a specified data set in the system catalog;
however, it must be a data set that has never been cataloged.  The UNCATALOG
command removes the specified data set from the system catalog.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION DSNAME
.optix dsname
dsname\\\\\\\\\\is the name of the cataloged data set that is to be
                recataloged.  You may recatalog data sets not belonging to
                you.  In that case, WYLBUR responds "<dsname> is not yours.",
                and then prompts for a password.  This option is required and
                must be specified first.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR,PUBLIC
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to recatalog a data set belonging to an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.  If this option is
                specified, you will be prompted for the password of the
                account before the command is executed.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME,TEMPORARY
.optix ON
.optix TEMPORARY
ON\{volume|TEMPORARY}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ON volume indicates the disk volume where the data set is to
                be recataloged.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of
                volume.)\ TEMPORARY allows you to catalog a data set on a
                temporary volume (e.g., SCR002).  (You are not charged for
                data sets saved on temporary volumes.  However, each morning
                all data sets on those volumes are scratched.)\ If the ON
                volume option or TEMPORARY option is not specified, WYLBUR
                automatically selects a volume.

.* OPTION UNIT
.optix UNIT
UNIT=device-type
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies a device type for recataloging a data set.  This
                option is most commonly used for cataloging a tape data set
                (UNIT=TAPE).

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\is a standard WYLBUR option that suppresses the system
                response given when the command is successful.
