XFORMAT [INDENT=n] [MARK [UNFORMATTED]]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
(** Extended EXECs only **)
The XFORMAT option indents and formats your Extended EXEC file.  The MARK
option marks each level of your Extended EXEC with a number and highlights the
BEGIN and END statements.  This can help you find syntax errors or mismatched
BEGIN/END statements in Extended EXECs.

With no other options, the XFORMAT command simply indents each level of your
EXEC file three spaces.

.* SELECT 'XFORMAT Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION INDENT
.optix INDENT
INDENT=n\\\\\\\\specifies the number of spaces you want each level of your
                EXEC file to be indented.  The default is 3.

.* OPTION MARK
.optix MARK
MARK\\\\\\\\\\\\marks each level of the EXEC file with a number and highlights
                begin and END statements.  The MARK option alone moves all
                lines flush left in the file.  MARK with UNFORMATTED does not
                move lines flush left.

.* OPTION UNFORMATTED
.optix UNFORMATTED
UNFORMATTED\\\\\when used with the MARK option, prevents the XFORMAT command
                from moving all lines in the file flush left.
