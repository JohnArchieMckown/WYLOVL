.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW LINE command lists the MILTEN line number, the logged-on user, and
other information as explained below.

The SHOW LINES command lists the line information for all logged-on users.
The sessions listed in the SHOW LINES response are listed in the order in
which the users logon (with the most recent first).  The format is as follows:

      n\gg.uuu\\\name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\program\port\[port-status]

where:

\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\is the MILTEN line number.  This is a unique number assigned
                to each logged-on user.

\\\gg.uuu\\\\\\\is the logged-on user's account.

\\\name\\\\\\\\\is the logged-on user's name specified with the SET NAME or
                the SET LINE command.

\\\program\\\\\\is the program you are currently using (for example, WYLBUR,
                SPIRES, or SOCRATES)

\\\port\\\\\\\\\identifies the path that connects your terminal to the
                computer (e.g., 11B-YH3.12).  Data Communications uses this
                information to identify a bad port.

\\\port-status\\indicate the port connection status.  The various states are:

                   (Msgs=<n>)   there are n messages queued for display.
                   (Nocomm)     the user is not accepting user messages.
                   (Nobreak)    the user is only accepting messages after he
                                has pressed the RETURN key.
                   (Nomsg)      the user is not accepting user or operator
                                messages.
                   (Viewing)    the user is currently in Page mode.
                   (Display)    the user is running a full-screen application.
                   (Micro)      the user is currently in Micro mode via
                                Samson.
                   (Oper)       the user is a system operator.

The SET LINE command allows you to change the user name specified by SET NAME
and displayed in the SHOW LINE/SHOW LINES responses.  Type HELP SET LINE for a
description of the command.

You can identify the sessions for an account with multiple logons by using the
SHOW LINE or SHOW LINES command.  WYLBUR's response to these commands includes
.pa
a number sign (#) and a number following the account to indicate multiple
logons.  For example:

   Command> show line
     31 B4.XYZ#2                       WYLBUR   11B-YH1.11

   Command> show lines xa.zzz
   Line Account  User name             Program  Port
     31 B4.XYZ#2                       WYLBUR   11B-DH1.11
      7 B4.XYZ                         EMSPIRES 11A-DH1.00
