.* DESCRIPTION
(** Extended EXECs only **)
The XPROC statement starts an Extended EXEC file.  It should be the first
statement of the file containing the Extended EXEC.

The same number of variables must be declared on the PROC statement as are
passed on the PCALL statement.  For example:

      Command>  XCALL myexec (1, 5, 'VT100')

   First line of exec in file myexec:
      XPROC (count, order, term)

If no variables are passed to the XPROC, include an empty set of parentheses
on the XPROC statement.

The BEGIN must follow the variable list, and should be matched by an END at
the END of the XPROC.

.* OPTION VARIABLE-LIST,VARIABLES
.optix variable-list
variable-list\\\a list of variables to receive any values passed to the XPROC.
                The list must be enclosed in parentheses, and variables should
                be separated by commas.  The invoking XCALL statement should
                have the same number of variables in its variable list.
