.* DESCRIPTION
The SET MAIL command allows you to receive electronic mail from other users.
Once you issue SET MAIL, your mail will be saved under your account in a data
set (called MAIL) that WYLBUR automatically sets up for you.  Any options
specified on the SET MAIL command are permanent until you change them.
.cs 2 on
Type HELP MAILBOX for more information about how to use the WYLBUR mail
facility.  See the document, Using WYLBUR Mail, for a description of the
online MAIL system.

SET NOMAIL, the default when an account is opened, prohibits other users from
sending you mail.  (Type HELP SET NOMAIL for a description of the command.)\
You can use SET MAIL to reverse the SET NOMAIL command, allowing users to send
you mail again.

The SHOW MAIL STATUS command displays your mailbox status, indicating whether
you are receiving, not receiving, or forwarding your mail, whether you can use
the ATTN/BREAK key to quit when you are reading your mail, and whether you
have set a message for your mailbox.  You can set or change that status by
including one or more of the following options on the SET MAIL command:
FORWARD, NOFORWARD, or 'message'.  (For more information, see the option
descriptions for SET MAIL.)\

Your mailbox status is also displayed each time you issue a SET MAIL
command.  If you are forwarding or not receiving your mail, that information
is displayed when you issue a SHOW MAIL command, as the first lines of the
response.  (Type HELP SHOW MAIL for a description of the command.)\

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION GG.UUU,ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR
.optix gg.uuu
gg.uuu\\\\\\\\\\specifies the account to set the mail status of an account
                other than that of the logged-on user.  Type HELP
                ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a description of the account-options.  If
                this option is specified, you will be prompted for the
                password of the account before the command is executed.

.* OPTION FORWARD,NOFORWARD
.optix FORWARD
.optix NOFORWARD
FORWARD\{uuu|gg.uuu}|NOFORWARD
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\FORWARD uuu re-directs mail to the user of the logged-on
                user's group.  FORWARD gg.uuu re-directs mail sent to your
                account to the account specified.  FORWARD with a network mail
                address like user@node re-directs mail to the specified
                account on the specified system.  NOFORWARD, the logon
                default, indicates that mail should be sent directly to your
                account.

.* OPTION MESSAGE
.optix message
'message'\\\\\\\allows you to set a message for your mailbox that will be
                displayed each time someone sends you mail.  The message can
                be up to 80 characters; it must be enclosed in quotation marks
                or apostrophes.  To delete the message, type:

                   SET MAIL ''

                (without a blank space between the apostrophes).

.* OPTION ATTN,NOATTN
.optix ATTN
.optix NOATTN
ATTN|NOATTN\\\\\ATTN, the default, allows you to use the ATTN/BREAK key in
                response to the "Delete?" prompt to quit from reading mail.
                NOATTN prevents it; instead, you must type Q or QUIT.
                NOATTN is useful when your communication path is so fast
                that if you press Break to stop a long scrolling message
                the Break is actually interpreted as the response to the
                "Delete?" prompt, booting you unceremoniously from SHOW MAIL.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the SET MAIL
                command into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for
                a description of these options.

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\requests that the system response be suppressed if the SET
                MAIL command is successful.
