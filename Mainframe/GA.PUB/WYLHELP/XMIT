XMIT jobid [MULTIPLE] [account-options] [SYSOUT=class] [FORMS=ffff]
     [DEST=destination] [collect-options] [QUIET]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The XMIT command transmits a job from SYSA (STANFORD) to SYSB (RLG).  Any
output hold status and time block information is preserved during transmission
and reset at the receiving system.  If the specified job is awaiting
execution, its output is transmitted after execution is completed.

The XMIT command can be issued on the SYSB system.  To issue it from the SYSA
system, prefix the command with the word SYSB (for example, "SYSB XMIT 1234").
