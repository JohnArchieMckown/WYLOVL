.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW PROTECT command displays the protection for zero or more disk data
sets, or a single tape volume.  A disk data set need not exist to use this
command.  The command returns the profile which would protect the data set if it
did exist.  Type HELP SET PROTECT ACCESS-RULES for a description of how to set
access rules for your disk data sets or your tape volume.

The SHOW PROTECT command alone with no options shows the default protection
profile for your files, that is, how files are protected when you don't
use the SET PROTECT command to give them any special protection attributes.

Typical output from the command will look similar to the following which
might have resulted from a SHOW PROTECT MASTER.* WITH DSN command:

Profile: WYL.GG.UUU.MASTER.*      Profile which protects data sets below
 Log   : FAILURE                  All failed attempts will be logged
                                  This line only appears if the log level is
                                  equal to PROTECT, FAILURES, WRITE or ALL.
                                  A log level of NONE which is the most
                                  common case will suppress this line and the
                                  next.

.* SELECT 'SHOW PROTECT Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION DEFAULT
.optix DEFAULT
DEFAULT\\\\\\\\\displays the account default profile.

.* OPTION PROFILENAME
.optix profilename
[$]profilename\\is the name of the RACF data set profile for which protection
                is to be displayed.  This profile name may include RACF
                'wildcards' (* and %) and may be truncated to a profile name
                stem as desired.  For a description of the meaning of the
                'wildcards' type HELP SET PROTECT PROFILENAME.  The '$' prefix
                suppresses the expansion of the WYL.gg.uuu prefix to the
                profilename.  This option only applies to disk data sets.

.* OPTION WITH DSNAMES
.optix WITH DSNAMES
WITH DSNames\\\\requests that the specific disk data sets protected by the
                profile be displayed also.

.* OPTION PROFILE
.optix PROFILE
PROFILE\\\\\\\\\If specified as the first operand of the SHOW PROTECT command
                it will display the profile which will protect a non-existent
                disk data set name.  If you try to show protect without this
                option for a data set that doesn't exist you will get an error
                message.

.* OPTION DSNAME
.optix dsname
[$]dsname\\\\\\\the name of the disk data set for which protection is to be
                displayed.  If the dsname is prefixed with a '$' then the
                WYLBUR prefix will be suppressed.  SHOW PROTECT $CATALOG.ABC
                gives the proper results whereas SHOW PROTECT CATALOG.ABC
                expands to SHOW PROTECT [WYL.gg.uuu.]CATALOG.ABC.  When the
                dsname identifies a library (partitioned data set), a member
                name must not be specified; protection applies to an entire
                library rather than individual members.

.* OPTION ALL
.optix ALL
ALL\\\\\\\\\\\\\requests protection status of all disk profile names for the
                account.  The resulting display also shows which data sets are
                protected by each profile.

.* OPTION ALL PROFILES
.optix ALL PROFILES
ALL PROFILES\\\\displays all disk profiles, but does not also display the
                associated data sets.

.* OPTION TAPE
.optix TAPE
TAPE\\\\\\\\\\\\requests that a tape protection profile be displayed.  If the
                keyword TAPE is not present in the command then information
                is assumed to be only for disk data sets.

.* OPTION TAPENO
.optix tapeno
tapeno\\\\\\\\\\the volume ID for which you want the protection profile to be
                displayed.  If you have at least read access to the data on
                the tape then you will be able to see the full access list.
                Otherwise not.

.* OPTION @TAPE
.optix @TAPE
@TAPE\\\\\\\\\\\requests that the tape protection default profile be displayed.
                This profile is used to set tape profiles (rather than using
                the matching dataset profile) when the owner account is
                different from the account imbedded in the dataset name.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR,PUBLIC
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account which owns the specified data set or
                profile if other than the logged-on user.  One form of this
                option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a
                description of the other account-options.  Note that
                protection cannot be displayed for a data set to which the
                requesting account has no access.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the SHOW PROTECT
                command into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for
                a description of these options.
