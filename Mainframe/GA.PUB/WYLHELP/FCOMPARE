FCOMPARE new-file TO old-file [collect-options]

.* DESCRIPTION
The FCOMPARE command compares two WYLBUR data sets.  The output of the command
describes which lines have been deleted and/or added to the old file in order
to make the new file.  The command can be abbreviated as FCOM.

The word 'active' may be used to compare your current active file.  To compare
the actual data set WYL.GG.UUU.ACTIVE, use the fully qualified data set name.

For example:
   fcompare text.new to text.old
   fcompare text acc gg.uuu to text.backup acc xx.xxx
   fcom active to #memo
   fcompare data1 to data2 collect clear
