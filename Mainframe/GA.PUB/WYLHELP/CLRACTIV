.* DESCRIPTION
The CLEAR ACTIVE command erases the current active file and opens a new one.
If NOWARN is specified, WYLBUR erases the active file regardless of the number
of changes made to the file since the last USE or SAVE command.  Otherwise,
WYLBUR prompts you when the number of changes equals or exceeds the WARN count
specified in the SET MODES command.  (Type HELP SET MODES WARN NOWARN for a
description of the WARN and NOWARN modes.)\

It is not often necessary to use the CLEAR ACTIVE command, since most commands
that you are likely to use with an empty active file, such as COLLECT, USE,
and FETCH, all have CLEAR and NOWARN options.  CLEAR TEXT is equivalent to
CLEAR ACTIVE.

The CLEAR ACTIVES command clears all of your active files.  Type SHOW ACTIVES
to see a list of your active files.

You can always recover the last active file cleared by typing the UNCLEAR
command.  Type HELP UNCLEAR for information.
