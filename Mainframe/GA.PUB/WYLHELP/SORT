collating sequence.

.* SELECT 'SORT Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the range of lines in the active file to be sorted.
                If this option is not specified, the entire Active file is
                assumed.  Note that the contents of the Active file will be
                changed.  Type HELP RANGE for a description of range.

.* OPTION COLUMNS
.optix COLUMNS
COLUMNS=v[/w]\\\v and w refer to the beginning and ending columns,
                respectively, that should be used in the sorting selection.
                If only v is specified, then only column v will be sorted.
                However, if no columns are specified, then all the columns are
                sorted.  Only one column range can be specified per SORT
                command.

.* OPTION DESCENDING,D
.optix DESCENDING
DESCENDING\\\\\\specifies that the sort sequence should be in descending EBCDIC
                character collating sequence.  This option can be abbreviated
                to D.

.* OPTION UPLOW,HEX
.optix UPLOW
.optix HEX
UPLOW|HEX\\\\\\\UPLOW specifies to not differentiate between upper- and
                lowercase letters in the collating sequence.  HEX specifies
                that the data consists of the printable characters 0-9 and
                A-F, which represents the hexadecimal characters.  The
                collating sequence for the sort is based on the hexadecimal
                values instead of the character values.

.* OPTION DELETE
.optix DELETE
DELETE\\\\\\\\\\will remove lines with identical sort keys.
