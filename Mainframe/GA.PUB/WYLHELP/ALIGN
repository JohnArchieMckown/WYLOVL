.* DESCRIPTION
The ALIGN command allows you to format paragraphs with whatever margins or
indentations you choose, regardless of how the text was entered.  WYLBUR
adjusts the contents of the lines in the specified range of the active file so
that each line contains as many words as possible but no more than the
specified LENGTH characters.

When WYLBUR must move the text from one line to another during alignment, it
splits the text at a blank (a word is never split onto two lines) and it puts
the rearranged text together by inserting one blank between the two parts.  It
inserts two blanks between the two parts if the first part ends in one of the
following characters:

     ?\:\.\!

WYLBUR renumbers that portion of the file that it aligned.

The JUSTIFY command performs a similar function; however, after performing the
alignment process, WYLBUR pads the lines with blanks so that each line
contains the exact number of specified LENGTH characters.

.* SELECT 'ALIGN Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the upper and lower limit of the group of lines to
                be aligned.  This option is required and must be specified
                first.  Alignment restarts whenever nonconsecutive lines in a
                range are encountered or when a new range is started, as in a
                disjoint range.  (Type HELP\RANGE for a description of a
                disjoint range.)\

.* OPTION LENGTH
.optix LENGTH
LENGTH=nnn\\\\\\nnn is a value of 1 to 235 characters.  Contents of lines will
                be aligned to the specified character length.  If this option
                is not specified, the lines will be aligned to the current
                value of global LENGTH.  Type HELP\SET\LENGTH for a
                description of length.

.* OPTION MARKER
.optix MARKER
MARKER=c\\\\\\\\c is any character.  Lines containing the marker character in
                column 1 will remain unchanged and the alignment process will
                be restarted with a new paragraph.  The characters:

                   (\)\"\,\'\=


                and lowercase letters must be in quotation marks.  Blank lines
                are always treated as marker lines.

.* OPTION INDENT
.optix INDENT
INDENT=x[[+]y|-y]
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\aligns indented material (i.e., text not beginning in column
                1) that is ordinarily ignored if this option is not specified.
                x is an integer and specifies that lines that are indented x
                spaces should be used for continuation lines of a paragraph.
                y can be a positive or negative integer and specifies that any
                line with ADDITIONAL indentation of y spaces should be used
                for the first line of a paragraph.  The default value of y is
                0.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\If EVEN is not specified, only text whose indentation matches
                the INDENT values will be aligned.  Text beginning in column 1
                has the indentation value of 0.  If the INDENT option is not
                specified, a default value of INDENT=0\0 is used.  Examples of
                this option are included below, following the option
                descriptions.

.* OPTION EVEN
.optix EVEN
EVEN\\\\\\\\\\\\must be used to cause any change in the existing indentation
                of text.  If EVEN is specified, WYLBUR ignores existing
                indentations, aligns all non-marker lines using the
                indentations specified or defaulted, and starts a new
                paragraph only after a blank line, a line with the marker
                character, or when the range is not consecutive.  An example
                of this option is included below, following the option
                descriptions.

.* OPTION SPACE
.optix SPACE
SPACE\\\\\\\\\\\removes extra spaces that may have been inserted by a previous
                JUSTIFY command.  Unless SPACE is used, extra blanks from the
                previous justification or alignment will be kept as part of
                the text when it is realigned.  Two blanks are always left
                after the characters:

                   ?\:\.\!

.* OPTION NUMBER
.optix NUMBER
NUMBER\\\\\\\\\\causes the entire file to be renumbered after the alignment
                process is complete.  The starting line number and the line
                increment will both be delta.  (Type HELP DELTA for a
                definition of delta.)\ If this option is not specified, only
                those lines in the aligned range will be renumbered.

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\LIST specifies that the line is to be listed after it is
                aligned.  NOLIST is the default for this command.  For
                additional list-options, type HELP\LIST-OPTIONS.

.us Examples to illustrate the use of the options, INDENT=x [y] and EVEN:

Assume the range you want to align consists of two paragraphs.  Each paragraph
contains contiguous lines of text beginning in column 6, and the paragraphs
are separated by a null line.

Example 1:  You want to retain column 6 as the beginning of all lines, but to
align them to a uniform length of 68.  To accomplish this, you would issue the
command:

     ALIGN range LENGTH=68 INDENT=5

Example 2:  You want to align the two paragraphs to length 68, with the first
line of each paragraph beginning in column 10 and the body of each paragraph
beginning in column 6.  You would issue the command:

     ALIGN range LENGTH=68 INDENT=5+4 EVEN

WYLBUR indents the first line of each paragraph 9 spaces (5+4) and indents the
body of each paragraph 5 spaces.  EVEN is necessary because the indentation of
the text is to be changed (i.e., the indentation for the first line of each
paragraph (9) is different from the indentation for the body of each paragraph
(5).  In the first example, EVEN is not necessary because the indentation is
NOT to be changed; it is the same for both the first line and the body of each
paragraph.
