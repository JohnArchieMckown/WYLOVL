Expressions

An expression in a WYLBUR EXEC file is a formula that can be resolved to a
string, number, or boolean value.  An expression may be any of the following:

    a single constant or variable:  LENGTH, 34, 'name', NEWMAIL
    a function:  SIZE('abcd')
    a series of constants, variables, and/or functions joined
        by operators:  count + 1 - size(var)

Type HELP EXEC FILE FUNCTION for information on the different EXEC File
Functions.

Evaluating Expressions with Operators:  Valid operations are:

     +     addition                *     multiplication
     -     subtraction             /     division
     ~     NOT                     ||    concatenation
     AND   logical AND             EQ    equals
     OR    logical OR              NE    not equal
     LT    less than               GT    greater than
     LE    less than or equal      GE    greater than or equal

Operator precedence (the order in which operations are executed if no
parentheses are used) is as follows:

      1  -  ~ (not)
      2  -  * and /
      3  -  + and -
      4  -  ||
      5  -  EQ NE GT GE LT and LE
      6  -  AND and OR
