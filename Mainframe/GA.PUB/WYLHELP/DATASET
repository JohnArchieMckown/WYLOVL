data set

A data set is a collection of data saved on a disk volume.  Once you issue a
SAVE command to save your active file, that file is referred to as a data set.
When issuing a SAVE command, you must include a data set name (dsname) that
you can use in future commands to refer to the data set.  Type HELP DSNAME for
a description of how to specify a data set name.
