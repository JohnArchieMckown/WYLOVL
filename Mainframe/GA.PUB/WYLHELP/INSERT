.* DESCRIPTION
The INSERT command allows you to add individual lines of text to the active
file.  Only the line numbers you specify will be inserted.  (Use the COLLECT
command to insert lines with an automatic increment.  Type HELP COLLECT for a
description of the command.)\

The short form of the INSERT command consists of responding to the command
prompt by typing in a single line number, followed by a blank character and
the contents of the new line of text.  When NOSHORT mode is in effect, WYLBUR
accepts this short form only after a permission prompt.  (Type HELP SET MODES
SHORT NOSHORT for a description of the SHORT and NOSHORT modes.)\ Note that L
and F, the normal abbreviations for the symbolic line numbers LAST and FIRST,
may not be used for this form of the INSERT command.

Using the short form of this command in an EXEC file to insert an already
existing line in the active file causes an error message and an EXEC BREAK.
(Type HELP EXECUTE for an explanation of an EXEC BREAK.)\ However, you can use
the short form in an EXEC file to insert a line or to replace an already
existing line.

.ix '@(BREAK)'
.ix 'BREAK key' 'use with @'
.ix key BREAK 'use with @'
After typing a line to be inserted, you can type an @ sign and press the BREAK
key to MODIFY or EDIT that line.  MODIFY or EDIT is selected based on the mode
in effect.  (Type HELP SET MODES MODIFY EDIT for a description of the MODIFY
and EDIT modes.)\ Just typing @ and pressing the BREAK key as the only
response to the line number prompt, allows you to MODIFY or EDIT the previous
line.  For example:

   Command> insert 5
   \\\\5.\\\> This is line five@***
   \\\\5.\\\\ This is line five
   \\\Mods\\>\\\\\\\\\ialtered
   \\\\5.\\\\ This is altered line five
   \\\Mods\\>
   Command> insert 6
   \\\\6.\\\> @***
   \\\\5.\\\\ This is altered line five
   \\\Mods\\>

.* SELECT 'INSERT Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION LINE-NUMBER
.optix line-number
line-number(s)[(n)]
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\indicates the line(s) to be added to the active file.
                Specifying (n) means that n lines are to be inserted starting
                at the given line number.  WYLBUR will automatically choose an
                appropriate increment to accommodate the lines.  You may
                specify as many line numbers as you wish, with or without the
                (n).  WYLBUR will prompt with each line number specified or
                implied, unless DITTO has also been specified.

.* OPTION DITTO
.optix DITTO
DITTO\\\\\\\\\\\causes the contents of the first inserted line to be repeated
                at each of the remaining lines to be inserted.  WYLBUR will
                prompt only with the first line number.  For example:

                   INSERT 3, 5(2), 7 DITTO

                causes WYLBUR to prompt for line 3 and then to insert two
                copies of line 3 starting at line 5 and one copy at line 7.

.* OPTION UPPER,UPLOW
.optix UPPER
.optix UPLOW
UPPER|UPLOW\\\\\when specified with INSERT, UPPER or UPLOW provides a
                temporary override of the session case setting.  UPLOW causes
                WYLBUR to retain the case (upper, lower, or a mixture) of the
                text collected.  UPPER causes WYLBUR to convert all lowercase
                letters to uppercase as the text is collected.  (Type HELP
                SET TERMINAL CASE for a further description of case settings.)\

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\NOLIST is the default for this command.  If LIST is is
                specified, the line before each inserted line is displayed
                (even if DITTO is specified).  As with DELETE, L is an
                abbreviation for LAST rather than LIST.  (For a description of
                the list-options, type HELP LIST-OPTIONS.)\

.* OPTION LENGTH-OPTIONS,LENGTH,NOLENGTH
.optix length-options
length-options\\provide an override for the global length message (established
                with the SET LENGTH command).  If you specify NOLENGTH, the
                warning message about excess length will not be issued (unless
                the line is over 235 characters).  Type HELP LENGTH-OPTIONS
                for a description of the length options.
