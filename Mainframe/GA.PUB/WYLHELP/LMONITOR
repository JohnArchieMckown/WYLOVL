.* DESCRIPTION
[Note:  This is a debugging tool currently under development.  It is too useful
not to make available to the programming community, but it may produce
inconsistent results or even cause Exec Breaks at this time.  Limits, such as
the 100-line limit of the trace, are subject to change without warning.]

The LMONITOR command lets you monitor the terminal input and output of
another terminal session for which tracing has been enabled. This command is
particularly useful for monitoring input and output from server sessions, but
can be used with any session, including virtual sessions run from BATWYL.

LMONITOR will show you the previous 100 lines of the session and then continues
with the current commands as they are entered and executed.

The session you want to trace must have tracing enabled.  For normal sessions,
this is done with the SET TERMINAL MONITOR command.  BATWYL sessions have
tracing enabled automatically.  Server sessions can have tracing automatically
if "trace=Yes" is specified in the RPC server profile.

You also must know the password to the account running the session in order to
see the tracing information.

If the session had "trace keep" in effect, then you may still be able to SHOW
LMONITOR on it after the session ends.  Only the most recent 25 sessions with
"trace keep" in effect are kept. KEEP is an option on the SET TERMINAL command.

The LMONITOR command is an alternate form of the SHOW LTRACE command with the
MONITOR option.

.* SELECT 'SHOW LMONITOR Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION n
.optix n
n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the line number of the session you want to monitor.
                One way to find that out is with the command "SHOW LINES
                VIRTUAL ACCOUNT gg.uuu", where "gg.uuu" is the account whose
                session you want to see.  Note the "(Tracing)" indicator on
                lines where tracing is in effect.  Use the line number, which
                appears at the beginning of the SHOW LINES information, in the
                SHOW LMONITOR command.  If no line number (or LIKE option) is
                specified, the same line shown by the previous SHOW LMONITOR
                command will be used.

.* OPTION name
.optix name
name\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the account or the name field that appears in the
                SHOW LINE response for the desired session.  The "name" may be
                just a partial match.  Currently this option works only for the
                next subsequently started server session; it will not find
                a session currently running, nor a normal terminal session.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the LMONITOR
                command into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for
                a description of these options.
