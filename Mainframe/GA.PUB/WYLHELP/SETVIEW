.* DESCRIPTION
The SET VIEW command allows you to set various Page WYLBUR options.  You can
also set these options using the VIEW command, but issuing the SET VIEW
command does not put you in Page WYLBUR (Page mode).

Since SET VIEW does not last across terminal sessions, it is a useful command
to add to your Logon EXEC file.

The SHOW VIEW command displays the Page WYLBUR options currently in effect.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED
.optix NUMBERED
.optix UNNUMBERED
NUMBERED|UNNUMBERED
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\NUMBERED, the default, causes the text in your active file to
                appear on the screen with line numbers.  The screen width is
                69 characters.  If your active file is empty, about 20 blank
                lines, each beginning with 'New.', appear on the screen.  This
                option remains in effect for the terminal session, until you
                issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with an UNNUMBERED option.
                UNNUMBERED causes the text in your active file to appear on
                the screen without line numbers, beginning in the first column
                of the screen display.  The screen width is usually 80
                characters.  If the active file is empty, about 20 blank lines
                without line numbers appear on the screen.  This option
                remains in effect for the terminal session, until you issue a
                VIEW or a SET VIEW command to with a NUMBERED option.

.* OPTION INDENT,NOINDENT
.optix INDENT
.optix NOINDENT
INDENT={n|AUTO}|NOINDENT
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n indents every line 'n' spaces when you press the RETURN key.
                AUTO indents each new line to the left margin of the previous
                line when you press the return key.  This automatic
                indentation mode is convenient for entering tables and block
                structured programs.  NOINDENT, the default, specifies that
                each new line begins at the left margin, regardless of the
                indentation of the previous line.  These options remain in
                effect for the terminal session, until you issue a VIEW or a
                SET VIEW command with an INDENT option.

.* OPTION MARGIN
.optix MARGIN
MARGIN=n\\\\\\\\sets the right hand margin of your VIEW screens to the column
                'n'.  This is useful if you work with lines longer or shorter
                than 69 columns.  This margin will remain for the terminal
                session, until you issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with a
                different margin length.

.* OPTION WRAP,NOWRAP
.optix WRAP
.optix NOWRAP
WRAP|NOWRAP\\\\\WRAP, the default, causes the cursor and text to automatically
                move to the beginning of the next line when you are entering
                or editing text in Page mode and reach the right margin of the
                screen.  This option remains in effect for the terminal
                session, until you issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with a
                NOWRAP option.  NOWRAP specifies that you must press the
                RETURN key to begin a new line of text in Page mode.  This
                option remains in effect for the terminal session, until you
                issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with a WRAP option.

.* OPTION INSERT,NOINSERT
.optix INSERT
.optix NOINSERT
INSERT|NOINSERT
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\INSERT puts you in insert mode at the start of any VIEW
                session.  This option is helpful if you prefer working in
                insert mode to working in the default overstrike mode.  This
                option remains in effect for the terminal session, until you
                issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with a NOINSERT option.
                NOINSERT, the default, puts you in overstrike mode at the
                start of any VIEW session, so that you can type over text.
                This remains in effect for the terminal session, until you
                issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with an INSERT option.

.* OPTION SPELL,NOSPELL
.optix SPELL
.optix NOSPELL
SPELL|NOSPELL\\\SPELL makes the speller check your text for spelling errors as
                you enter it, and highlights any possibly misspelled words.
                Type HELP SPELL for a description of the speller.  This option
                remains in effect for the terminal session, until you issue a
                VIEW or a SET VIEW command with a NOSPELL option.  NOSPELL,
                the default, causes the speller to not check your text for
                spelling errors unless you issue the SPELL command from the
                command line.  This option remains in effect for the terminal
                session, until you issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with a
                SPELL option.

.* OPTION FORMATTED,UNFORMATTED
.optix FORMATTED
.optix UNFORMATTED
FORMATTED|UNFORMATTED
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\FORMATTED puts the VIEW window into "read-only" mode: you can't
                change the text by typing in the window, but you can use the
                paging commands (previous page, next page, etc.) to scroll
                through the active file. Character and display format-strings,
                such as <..b+> for bold, or <::bullet> for a bullet, will be
                interpreted in FORMATTED mode; in UNFORMATTED mode, they appear
                in their string form, for editing.  Use UNFORMATTED to switch
                back to normal VIEW editing mode.  The option remains in effect
                for the terminal session until you issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW
                command to change it.

.* OPTION WIDTH
.optix WIDTH
WIDTH=n\\\\\\\\\Displays "n" columns of text at the start of any VIEW session.
                The default width is 80 columns.  (If viewing with line
                numbers, the number of columns of text displayed will be 11
                less than "n".)  The valid range of "n" is 20 to 235 columns.
                The setting remains in effect for the terminal session, or
                until you issue a VIEW or a SET VIEW command with a different
                width setting.  Setting "n" to a larger width than your screen
                can handle is not a good idea.

.* OPTION HEIGHT
.optix HEIGHT
HEIGHT=n\\\\\\\\Sets the height (number of rows) for the VIEW session.  The
                default height is 24 rows or, if the SET TERMINAL command was
                issued prior to the first VIEW command, the number of rows
                specified as the second number of the HEIGHT option on that
                command.  The lowest valid "n" is 10.  The setting remains in
                effect for the terminal session, or until you issue a VIEW or a
                SET VIEW command with a different height setting.  Setting "n"
                to a larger height than your screen can handle is not
                recommended.
