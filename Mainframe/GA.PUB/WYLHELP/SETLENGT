The SET LENGTH command allows you to set a line length for lines collected or
edited in the active file.  Length can be any value between 1 and 235;
however, the default length at logon is 72 characters.  If you exceed the
specified or default length, WYLBUR accepts the line but issues a warning
message.

SHOW LENGTH displays the current value of LENGTH.
