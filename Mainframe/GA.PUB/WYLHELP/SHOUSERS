.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW USERS command displays the UserIDs of the currently logged-on users.
The accounts are displayed alphabetically.  (If the UserID has periods in it,
WYLBUR assumes the part following the last period is the last name, and uses
that as the primary sort field.)  Logged-on accounts that do not have UserIDs
set are listed by account number ("gg.uuu" form) in alphabetic order after the
UserIDs.

For a list of logged-on users strictly by account numbers, use the command
SHOW ACCOUNTS.
