.* DESCRIPTION
The SET MSTAT command lets you set three internal flags used by WYLBUR
to handle mail for your account or some other account for which you
have the password.  This command is meant for use by system
programmers and consultants when restoring mail files.  The SHOW
MSTAT command can show you the current status of the flags.

.* SELECT 'SET MSTAT Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION GG.UUU,ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR
.optix gg.uuu
gg.uuu\\\\\\\\\\specifies the account whose mail status you want to set.  If
                omitted, the command affects your account.  If used, this must
                be the first option.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a
                description of the account-options.

.* OPTION MAIL,NOMAIL
.optix MAIL
.optix NOMAIL
MAIL|NOMAIL\\\\\If the MAIL flag is set, then WYLBUR believes there is new
                mail (that is, mail unmarked as "kept") in the mailbox.  If
                the NOMAIL flag is set, then WYLBUR believes there is no new
                mail.  If NOMAIL is set, then SHOW MAIL will not show any
                mail, even if there really is new mail.  It is sometimes
                necessary to SET MSTAT MAIL when restoring a WYLBUR mail file
                in order for the SHOW MAIL command to work properly again.
                (Sending a mail message to the account is another way to reset
                the MAIL flag.)

.* OPTION KEPT,NOKEPT
.optix KEPT
.optix NOKEPT
KEPT|NOKEPT\\\\\If the KEPT flag is set, then WYLBUR believes there is kept
                mail in the mailbox.  If the NOKEPT flag is set, then WYLBUR
                believes there is no kept mail.  If NOKEPT is set, then SHOW
                MAIL KEPT will not show any mail, even if there really is kept
                mail.  It is sometimes necessary to SET MSTAT KEPT when
                restoring a WYLBUR mail file in order for the SHOW MAIL KEPT
                command to work properly again.  (Marking a mail message as
                KEPT on the account is another way to reset the KEPT flag.)

.* OPTION DEFQ,NODEFQ
.optix DEFQ
.optix NODEFQ
DEFQ|NODEFQ\\\\\If the DEFQ flag is set, then WYLBUR believes there is a
                MAILDEFQ data set containing additional mail for the account's
                mailbox.  The SHOW MAIL command, sensing DEFQ is set, will look
                for the MAILDEFQ data set when showing mail.  (A MAILDEFQ data
                set can be created temporarily by WYLBUR when mail is sent to
                you while you are reading your mail.) If NODEFQ is set, then
                WYLBUR believes there is not a MAILDEFQ data set, and will not
                look for it when a SHOW MAIL command is issued.  WYLBUR will
                set the DEFQ flag when it creates a MAILDEFQ data set, and set
                NODEFQ when it merges the MAILDEFQ mail with the MAIL mail
                during the next SHOW MAIL command.
