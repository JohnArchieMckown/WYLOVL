XRETURN [(variable-list)] [attn-vars|error-vars|COMMAND=command]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
(** Extended EXECs only **)
The XRETURN statement ends the execution of an XPROC in an Extended EXEC and
optionally returns the values of some variables that were passed on
invocation.  If the XPROC statement is issued within a PROC, it ends the
execution of both the PROC and XPROC.

Variables do not need to be returned in any specific order, and you do not
need to return every variable that was passed to the procedure.  You can have
multiple XRETURN statements in a PROC; the first one executed will end the
PROC.

You can also set the ATTN or ATTNID variables or the ERROR, ERRID or ERRMSG
variables on the XRETURN command; this is useful if you have multiple layers of
XCALLs which each have their own attention or error routines.  Only ATTN or
only ERROR variables can be used in a single XRETURN command, not both.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION VARIABLE-LIST,VARIABLES
.optix variable-list
variable-list\\\passes a list of variables back to the invoking procedure.
                The list must be enclosed in parentheses, and variables should
                be separated by commas.  Variables do not need to be returned
                in any specific order.

.* OPTION ATTN-VARS
.optix attn-vars
attn-vars\\\\\\\lets you set the ATTN and ATTNID variables when returning from
                an XPROC.  ATTN, a boolean, is specified by itself to set a
                TRUE value; you assign a value to ATTNID, as in ATTNID=ATTN (no
                quotes around the value for ATTNID).  See the document Extended
                EXEC Files for more information.

.* OPTION ERROR-VARS
.optix error-vars
error-vars\\\\\\lets you set the ERROR, ERRID and ERRMSG variables when
                returning from an XPROC.  ERROR, a boolean, is specified by
                itself to set a TRUE value; you assign a value to ERRID, as in
                ERRID=NOPARMS (no quotes around the value), and to ERRMSG, as
                in ERRMSG='You must enter parameter values.'  See the document
                Extended EXEC Files for more information.

.* OPTION COMMAND
.optix COMMAND
COMMAND=command
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\invokes the specified command as you exit the proc.
