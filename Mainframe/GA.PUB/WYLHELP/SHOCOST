.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW COST command displays your current session costs and a breakdown of
the resources used.  The cost shown is an estimate (it is not your actual
billing charge) and may have roundoff errors amounting to a few cents.

The response from the SHOW COST command is:

     [A cost warning message will be issued after every $nn.nn billed.]

     hh:mm:ss elapsed time [($n.nn)]      nnnn disk I/O's
     n.nn CPU seconds [($n.nn)]           nnnn terminal I/O's

     [Current session charges: $n.nn]

where:

   elapsed time     is the amount of (wall clock) time you have been logged on
                    during the current session.  There is currently no charge
                    for elapsed time, except during the 6 pm-6 am time slot
                    when computer charges are $1 an hour.

   disk I/O's       is the number of ORVYL and WYLBUR disk requests that you
                    have made.  (Commands such as USE and SAVE make disk
                    requests.)\ There is currently no charge for disk
                    requests.

   CPU seconds      is the number of seconds the computer has used to
                    process your requests.

   terminal I/O's   is the number of messages that have been written to the
                    terminal plus the number of input lines you have typed.

.* SELECT 'SHOW COST Command Options'

.* OPTION INTERNAL
.optix INTERNAL
INTERNAL\\\\\\\\returns the billing information in a fixed column format.
                This is helpful when the response is being directed to the
                ACTIVE file for further processing (with the command DUMP COST
                INTERNAL).  The format is:

\....v....1....v....2....v....3....v....4....v....5....v....6....v
