.* DESCRIPTION
The LIST command displays all or part of the active, EXEC, or external file.

.* SELECT 'LIST Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the range of lines to be listed.  If a range is not
                specified, the entire file will listed.  If this option is
                used, it must be specified first.  Type HELP RANGE for a
                description of range.

.* OPTION EXECUTE
.optix EXECUTE
EXECUTE\\\\\\\\\specifies that all or part of the EXEC file is to be listed.
                The default is the active file is to be listed.

.* OPTION FROM
.optix FROM
FROM\dsname\\\\\is the name of an external file from which the specified or
                default range is to be displayed.  (Type HELP DSNAME for a
                description of dsname.)\ The default is that all or part of
                the active file is listed.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR,PUBLIC
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to list a data set belonging to an account
                other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of this
                option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a
                description of the account-options.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME
.optix ON
ON\volume\\\\\\\indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ If
                this option is not specified, the volume set with the SET
                VOLUME command will be searched; if no volume is set, the
                system catalog, an index of data sets, will be searched for
                the data set name and volume location.  (All data sets are
                automatically cataloged when they are saved, unless you
                specify otherwise.)\

.* OPTION FORMAT-OPTIONS,EDIT,CARD,PRINT,LRECL
.optix format-options
format-options\\allow you to specify the record length and the treatment of
                WYLBUR line numbers in the external file.  The format-options
                NUMBERED, UNNUMBERED, and INTEGER apply only to LIST FROM;
                they do not apply to LIST.  Type HELP FORMAT-OPTIONS for a
                description of the format-options.

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\LIST, the default for this command, lists the text and line
                numbers of the specified range.  The UNNUMBERED option lists
                only the text of the lines in the range and shifts the text to
                the left.  NOTEXT suppresses printing of the text and lists
                only the numbers.  NONUMBERED lists the text only and replaces
                the line number with blanks.  For a description of all the
                list options, type HELP LIST-OPTIONS.

.* OPTION HEX,MIXED
.optix HEX
.optix MIXED
HEX|MIXED\\\\\\\HEX specifies that the listing be in hexadecimal
                representation.  MIXED causes all nonprinting (control)
                characters to be displayed in their EBCDIC hexadecimal format,
                enclosed in angle brackets.  For example, <270C> represents
                the two characters X'27' and X'0C'.

.* OPTION UNFORMATTED
.optix UNFORMATTED
UNFORMATTED\\\\\prints any WYLBUR formatting instructions, such as those for
                italic or underlined text, instead of executing them.  The
                default is formatted, in which case any bold, italic, or
                underlining specified shows up on the terminal screen.

.* OPTION CC,MC
.optix CC
.optix MC
CC|MC\\\\\\\\\\\CC or MC causes the character in column 1 of each line in the
                range to be treated as a printer control character.  MC is
                valid only for files with machine control (MC) characters such
                as those normally created by some of the IBM assemblers or
                compilers.

.* OPTION COLUMNS,COLS
.optix COLUMNS
COLUMNS=m[/n]\\\restricts the listing to the columns specified.  If only m is
                specified, columns n through 235 are used.  Otherwise, the
                entire line is used.

.* OPTION MARKER
.optix MARKER
MARKER=c\\\\\\\\causes the listing to be suspended at any line that has the
                marker character in column 1.  The marker character (c) can be
                any character, but it must be enclosed in quotation marks or
                apostrophes if it is a lowercase letter or one of the
                following characters:

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\)\(\"\'\=\,\;\blank

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Listing is restarted by pressing the RETURN key.  The line
                containing the marker character is not listed, but a blank
                line will occur because of the carriage return needed to
                restart the listing.  A blank line may be inserted as a marker
                in a line range.  If a blank line is used, the MARKER
                character must be specified as a blank '\'.

.* OPTION INDENT
.optix INDENT
INDENT=n\\\\\\\\inserts n blanks at the left of each line listed.

.* OPTION DOUBLE,TRIPLE
.optix DOUBLE
.optix TRIPLE
DOUBLE|TRIPLE\\\produce a listing with double or triple spacing, respectively.
                Single spacing is the default.

.* OPTION SQUASHED
.optix SQUASHED
SQUASHED\\\\\\\\squashes all multiple blanks to single blanks before listing
                the line.  The file is not changed.  This option is very
                useful when looking at fetched output since listing lines
                containing many blanks can be very slow at a terminal.

.* OPTION NONL
.optix NONL
NONL\\\\\\\\\\\\suppresses the automatic insertion of the NL (new line or
                carriage return) character in text being listed at the
                terminal.  It is particularly well suited for online plotting
                at the terminal.  However, use of NONL requires that an NL
                (X'15') be included in the text stream wherever a new line is
                to occur.

.pa
.* OPTION NOMODEL
.optix NOMODEL
NOMODEL\\\\\\\\\specifies that the data to be written should not be
                interpreted as containing model terminal sequences.  This is
                useful when the data contains escape sequences.

.* OPTION NOPAUSE
.optix NOPAUSE
NOPAUSE\\\\\\\\\lists the message without any page pauses.  Page pauses
                normally occur when WYLBUR lists the number of lines specified
                in the SET TERMINAL HEIGHT command.  This is useful for EXEC
                files.

.* OPTION CLEAN
.optix CLEAN
CLEAN\\\\\\\\\\\will prevent messages from other terminals from interrupting
                an online listing.  However, messages from the operator will
                interrupt.

.* OPTION FORCE
.optix FORCE
FORCE\\\\\\\\\\\lists output to the terminal even if SET TERMINAL QUIET is in
                effect for the session.  Type HELP SET TERMINAL QUIET for
                information.  (This option is used primarily in EXEC files.)\

.* OPTION ATTN
.optix ATTN
ATTN={line-number|label}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\allows you to specify the line number or label in the EXEC file
                at which to resume execution after interrupting (by pressing
                the BREAK key) a LIST operation.  This option is only useful in
                EXEC files.  The "label" option is allowed only in extended
                EXEC files.
