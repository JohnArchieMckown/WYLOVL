OSRENAME dsname TO dsname [QUIET]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The OSRENAME command renames WYLBUR files.  Files can be individual data sets,
individual library members, or entire libraries.  The catalog entry for the
old data set is deleted and the new catalog entry created.

You cannot rename a sequential data set to a library member.  Library members
can only be renamed within the same library.  When renaming a member of a
library, the library name is specified only in the old data set name.
