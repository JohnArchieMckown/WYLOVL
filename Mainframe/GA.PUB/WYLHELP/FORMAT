Formatting in WYLBUR

You can imbed simple display format-strings in your WYLBUR text to use bold,
italic, underscored, and flashing text, and to generate page breaks.  These
formatting options will then appear when you LIST, PRINT or LPRINT the text,
but not when you VIEW, MODIFY or EDIT the text (giving you a chance to edit
the imbedded commands.)  You can, however, do VIEW FORMATTED to have the
options take effect in VIEW mode.

The strings to imbed are as follows (you must include the angle brackets
around each one):

     <..B+> Start Bold           <..B-> Stop Bold
     <..I+> Start Italics        <..I-> Stop Italics
     <..U+> Start Underlining    <..U-> Stop Underlining
     <..F+> Start Flashing       <..F-> Stop Flashing    (terminals only)

     <..BELL>   Ring the terminal bell
     <..PAGE>   Begin a new page (put this by itself on a line)
     <..FRONT>  Begin a new page, on the front side of the paper (for
                 the Xerox 4635 printer only) (put this by itself on a line)
     <..NORMAL> Resets all formatting options

For color monitors:
     <..RED>     or <..RED+>     Start Red Text    <..RED->     Stop Red Text
     <..BLUE>    or <..BLUE+>    Start Blue        <..BLUE->    Stop Blue
     <..GREEN>   or <..GREEN+>   Start Green       <..GREEN->   Stop Green
     <..YELLOW>  or <..YELLOW+>  Start Yellow      <..YELLOW->  Stop Yellow
     <..CYAN>    or <..CYAN+>    Start Cyan        <..CYAN->    Stop Cyan
     <..MAGENTA> or <..MAGENTA+> Start Magenta     <..MAGENTA-> Stop Magenta
     <..WHITE>   or <..WHITE+>   Start White       <..WHITE->   Stop White

The format-strings may be specified anywhere in your text.  Be sure to turn
off any attribute that you turn on.  For example, your input might include
"<..B+> Text to be bold <..B->".

If your terminal, monitor or printer does not support any of these
characteristics, the sequences are ignored, though the format-strings do not
appear.

Note:  ".I+" means italics for PRINT and inverse-video for LIST (since most
terminals do not have italic characters).

To actually see the format-strings (instead of their effects) you must issue
the command:

     LIST UNFORMATTED   -or-   PRINT UNFORMATTED

You are in "UNFORMATTED" mode whenever you MODIFY text, and normally when you
VIEW text.  You can VIEW FORMATTED, however.  In this mode, you cannot change
anything on the screen; you must VIEW UNFORMATTED to display the
format-strings and allow changes.

For information about how to handle special characters, which can be created
in your text in a similar way (such as a copyright symbol), issue the command
HELP CHARACTER FORMAT-STRINGS.
