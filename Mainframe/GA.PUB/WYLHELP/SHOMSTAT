.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW MSTAT command provides status information about WYLBUR mail for your
account or the account named.  Unlike the STATUS option on the SHOW MAIL
command, you do not need to know the other account's password to see this
information.

Most of the settings shown can be controlled with the SET MAIL and SET NOMAIL
commands.

The status information includes whether the account is set to receive mail,
whether mail sent to the account is being forwarded to another address, and
whether a message is set that will be displayed to the sender when the sender
sends mail to the account (if set, it usually says something like "Back in the
office on Dec. 10th", to alert the sender that the mail may not be read for
awhile).

The "SHOW MAIL options" part of the display will have either ATTN or NOATTN,
depending on whether the ATTN key can be used to cancel the SHOW MAIL command.

The "Status flags" part of the display shows internal information of use
primarily to system programmers.  The first value is either MAIL or NOMAIL,
depending on whether there is new mail (that is, mail not marked as "kept") in
the mailbox.  The second is either KEPT or NOKEPT depending on whether there is
kept mail in the mailbox.

The third option is DEFQ or NODEFQ, depending on whether WYLBUR has temporarily
created a MAILDEFQ data set in order to allow mail to be sent to you while you
are reading other mail.  WYLBUR takes care of merging the MAILDEFQ file with
the regular MAIL file during the next SHOW MAIL command.  The flag in effect
tells WYLBUR that there is a MAILDEFQ data set to examine when a SHOW MAIL
command is issued.
