The general form of a line number is as follows:

.ix '+' 'on line-number'
.ix line-number '+'
.ix '-' 'on line-number'
.ix line-number '-'
     number[{+|-}increment]

number\\\\\\may be either a constant between .001 and 99999.999, or one of the
            symbolic line numbers described below.

increment\\\may be either a constant between .001 and 99999.999, or the
            current value of delta.  (Type HELP DELTA for a description of
            delta.)\

Consider the following when specifying line numbers in a command:

   1.\When specifying decimals, you can leave out leading and trailing zeros
      (e.g., 1.2 rather than 00001.200) without affecting the significance,
      except in determining a value for delta in the commands COPY, MOVE, and
      COLLECT.  (Type HELP DELTA for a description of delta.)\

   2.\You can specify whole numbers without a decimal.  Thus, 17.0, 17., and
      17 are equivalent.

   3.\Observe the following additional rules, if you use the form,
      number{+|-}increment:

      a.\Specify the number and the plus or minus sign without a blank in
         between (e.g., COLLECT FIRST+2).

      b.\The resulting number must be between 0 and 99999.999.

Symbolic line numbers
---------------------

.us Symbolic line numbers

Symbolic line numbers are changing pointers to lines in an active or execute
file.  There are 7 symbolic line numbers:

     FIRST
     LAST
     END
     PREVIOUS
     CURRENT or *
     NEXT
     RETURN

.ix 'FIRST (line-number)'
.ix line-number symbolic FIRST
.ix 'LAST (line-number)'
.ix line-number symbolic LAST
FIRST and LAST are the first and last lines in a file and always exist even if
the file has no lines.  Both have the value 0 if the file is empty.  If the
file has only one line, FIRST and LAST are equal.  When specified in a range
for an external file, first is 0 and last is 99999.999.

.ix 'END (line-number)'
.ix line-number symbolic END
.ix END 'as line-number'
END points to the line number that WYLBUR would add after the last line
(LAST).  END is the first line number greater than LAST that is a multiple of
delta.  For example, if the last line number is 10 or 10.2, and the delta is
1, the value of END is 11.  This does not mean that line 11 exists, but that
the next line WYLBUR would add would be 11.  END has the value of delta when
the file is empty.  (Type HELP SET DELTA for a description of delta.)\

.ix 'CURRENT (line-number)'
.ix line-number symbolic CURRENT
.ix 'NEXT (line-number)'
.ix line-number symbolic NEXT
CURRENT is the line most recently edited; NEXT is the line immediately after
CURRENT, and PREVIOUS is the line immediately before it.  When a line has been
edited, it means that WYLBUR has executed an editing command such as:  ALIGN,
CENTER, COPY, DELETE, EDIT, INSERT, JUSTIFY, MODIFY, MOVE, NUMBER, POINT, or

.ix 'PREVIOUS (line-number)'
.ix line-number symbolic PREVIOUS
REPLACE.  If the file has not been edited or if it is empty, PREVIOUS,
CURRENT, and NEXT do not exist.  Under these conditions, the value given to
PREVIOUS, CURRENT, or NEXT will be -1.000 if they are part of an expression.
This value assignment is useful in EXEC files.

The SET CURRENT and SHOW CURRENT commands set and display the value of CURRENT.
The symbol * as a line number is equivalent to current.

.ix 'CURRENT (line-number)'
.ix line-number symbolic CURRENT
.ix 'LAST (line-number)'
.ix line-number symbolic LAST
For an external file, the symbolic line numbers CURRENT and LAST are assigned
.ix 'PREVIOUS (line-number)'
.ix line-number symbolic PREVIOUS
the values 0 and 99999.999 respectively; the symbolic line numbers PREVIOUS
.ix 'NEXT (line-number)'
.ix line-number symbolic NEXT
and NEXT never exist.

.ix 'RETURN (line-number)'
.ix line-number symbolic RETURN
.ix RETURN 'as line-number'
The symbolic line number RETURN is designed to be used in EXEC files and
provides a limited subroutine facility.  RETURN is initialized to 0 and can
only be changed with the commands SET RETURN and EXECUTE SAVE.
