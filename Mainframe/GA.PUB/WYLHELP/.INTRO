.chapter 'Introduction to WYLBUR'
WYLBUR is a computer program you can use for text-editing, job submission and
retrieval, and communicating with others who have an ITS account.  You can
also use WYLBUR as a programming language, through the combination of the
WYLBUR preprocessor (an expression evaluator) and some WYLBUR commands (e.g.,
EXECUTE, SHOW VALUE, READ).

WYLBUR's text editing capabilities allow you to create, edit, search, and
display a variety of text including memos, manuals, computer programs, and
data.  There are two editing modes available on WYLBUR:  Line mode (in which
you edit text line by line) and Page mode (in which you edit a full screen of
text).  They are referred to as Line mode WYLBUR and Page WYLBUR respectively.
You may use either or both, according to your preference.

You can use the job submission and retrieval capabilities to submit your work
to the batch system for processing.  The batch system collects requests for
the computer to do work (in a batch) and processes them independently of the
interactive (or terminal) system.

The MAIL system in WYLBUR allows you to communicate with others who who have
ITS accounts.  You can send, receive, and store messages from your terminal.
.section 'WYLBUR Features'
To use WYLBUR, you issue instructions or commands at a computer terminal.
WYLBUR is easy to learn because it has an English-like command language.  For
example, the command CENTER\1/81\LENGTH=72 means to center lines 1 through 81
within a line length of 72 characters.

WYLBUR is also easy to use.  If you make a typing error, you can backspace
over the error and type in the correction.  You can also press the BREAK key
to redo an entire line.

.ix 'command retry'
A feature called command retry allows you to use WYLBUR's editing facilities
to correct or edit the last command you issued without retyping the entire
command.  In addition, if you forget to give WYLBUR all the information
necessary for a specific command, it prompts for the missing data.

WYLBUR automatically saves the text you are working on if either the computer
or WYLBUR malfunctions ("crashes" or "goes down") or if, for any reason, you
lose your terminal connection.

.ix 'HELP facility'
WYLBUR's online HELP facility provides details about the syntax, function, and
options of all commands and includes explanations of some terminology and
guides to further assistance.  When you are using WYLBUR, you can type HELP
for more information about how to use the HELP facility.

The HELP facility also includes explanations for the error messages WYLBUR
displays at your terminal when you issue a command that it cannot execute.
See Section 1.6.2 for more information about how to get error message
explanations.
.section 'Getting an ITS Account and a Terminal'
Before you can use WYLBUR, you must open an ITS account at Account Services in
Forsythe Hall.  You may use WYLBUR on a public terminal (provided by ITS for
use by all ITS account holders) or on a purchased or rented terminal.  Most
public terminals are located in Forsythe Hall, although there are several
other public terminal areas on campus.  (Call Instruction and Research
Information Systems, 723-1055, for further information.)\ If you prefer to
rent or buy a terminal and have it installed at your work location, call
Communications Services, 723-1148.  Several models of both video screen and hard-copy
terminals are available.  The document
.italic 'Introduction to Terminals and Communication Services at Forsythe Hall'
available in Document Sales, Forsythe Hall, includes information about
terminal characteristics and available interactive facilities.
.section 'The Terminal Keyboard and Special Keys'
You can use WYLBUR on a CRT terminal that displays your text or data on a
video screen or on a hard-copy terminal that prints your text or data on
paper.  Although the keyboard arrangement on terminals is similar to the
keyboard arrangement on typewriters, there are certain keys that have special
functions when using WYLBUR.
.subsection 'RETURN Key'
.ix 'RETURN key'
.ix key RETURN
The RETURN key moves the current typing position to the left margin (as on a
typewriter); however, it has additional functions in WYLBUR.  If you press
RETURN after typing a command, you are telling WYLBUR to begin executing the
command.  Pressing RETURN at the end of a line of text or data you are
entering tells WYLBUR to store the line and issue a line number prompt for a
new line.  (On some terminals, the RETURN key may be labeled ENTER.)\
.subsection 'BACKSPACE Key'
.ix 'BACKSPACE key'
.ix key BACKSPACE
The BACKSPACE key moves the typing position one space to the left and erases
whatever was in that space from the computer's memory.  This allows you to
correct typing errors before sending information to WYLBUR.  You backspace
over the incorrect characters, type the corrections, and retype the rest of
the line.  Although in some cases the characters will remain on your screen,
WYLBUR effectively erases all the characters that the cursor backspaces over.
(The cursor is a blinking underline or block that indicates where you are in
your text.)\ The command SET TERMINAL BACK (see Part II, the SET TERMINAL
command) changes the function of the backspace key so that you can enter
backspace characters in your text.  This allows you to accomplish tasks such
as printing a copy of your file that contains overprinted characters.  When
.ix 'DELETE key'
.ix key DELETE
SET TERMINAL BACK is in effect, use the DELETE key to erase the previous
character.
.subsection 'BREAK Key'
.ix '(BREAK)'
.ix 'BREAK key'
.ix key BREAK
The BREAK key (or ATTN key on some terminals) has a variety of functions.
Since it actually breaks the connection with the computer briefly, you use
BREAK to get the computer's attention or to interrupt what it is doing.  When
you press the BREAK key, WYLBUR generally responds by typing three dots (...)
or three asterisks (***).  You can accomplish the following by pressing the
BREAK key:
.point set b
.point begin
Change from line number prompting (COLLECT mode) to command
prompting (COMMAND
mode). That is, if you press the BREAK key as the first
character in
response to
a line number prompt
WYLBUR prompts for a command.
.point
.ix 'BREAK key' 'in Page mode'
.ix key BREAK 'in Page mode'
Change from Page mode to command prompting (COMMAND mode).  If you press the
BREAK key from any location on the Page mode screen, you will be returned to a
COMMAND prompt.
.point
Discard a command or the entire line of text that you are currently typing so
you can begin again.
.point
Interrupt any listing or typing WYLBUR does at your terminal (such as
automatic NEWS or listing your active file).
.point
Stop execution of most commands.
.point
Stop an EXEC file with an EXEC BREAK if an EXEC file is executing.
(See the EXECUTE in Part II, for a description of an EXEC BREAK.)\
.point
Terminate a process if
you press the BREAK key as the first character in answer to permission
prompts, information prompts, and programmed prompts (see Section 1.6.1).
.point
.ix 'command retry'
Perform special functions in an EDIT or MODIFY command.
(See Part II for a description of the EDIT and MODIFY commands.)\
.point end
.subsection 'Page Mode Function Keys'
.ix key sequences
The CONTROL, DELETE, and ESCAPE keys have special functions in Page WYLBUR.
To issue a command in Page mode, you press one of these three keys followed by
another key or series of keys.  These commands are called key sequences.

.ix 'CONTROL key' 'in Page mode'
.ix key CONTROL 'in Page mode'
The CONTROL key sequences (Page mode commands that use the CONTROL key)
control the movement of the cursor (a blinking square or underline) in Page
mode.
.ix 'DELETE key' 'in Page mode'
.ix key DELETE 'in Page mode'
The DELETE key sequences delete text in Page mode.
.ix 'ESCAPE key' 'in Page mode'
.ix key ESCAPE 'in Page mode'
The ESCAPE key sequences move, rearrange, and format text in your screen in
Page mode.

.ix 'terminals' 'in Page mode'
.ix 'function keys' 'in Page mode'
.ix keys function 'in Page mode'
In addition, Page WYLBUR uses the extra function keys on many different
terminals to replace key sequences.  In some cases you only need to press one
key instead of two or three.  The function keys vary from terminal to
terminal.  Type HELP TERMINALS for a list of supported terminals in Page mode.
Type HELP TERMINAL followed by your terminal type to find out about the
function keys on your supported terminal.

.ix keys 'in Page mode' . 'see VIEW command'
See Part II, the VIEW command, for a description of the different Page mode
commands.
.section 'How to LOGON'
.ix logon sequence
Once you have an ITS account and access to a terminal, you can establish an
electronic connection between your terminal and the computer.  While the
process is simple, it varies somewhat depending on the type of terminal and
the type of communication equipment connected to the terminal.  A handout,
.italic 'How to Logon and Logoff,'
describes in detail how to establish a connection between a terminal and the
computer.  It is available in Document Sales, Forsythe Hall.

Once you successfully establish a connection, you get a message identifying
the computer, followed by several prompts (questions) from WYLBUR so you can
identify yourself.  This procedure is called logging on.  Once you respond to
a prompt, press the RETURN key to actually send the information to WYLBUR.

The current logon sequence is as follows:
.sk
   Connecting to port 11C-DH2.03
.sk
   Welcome to the Stanford Data Center (SYSA), Forsythe Hall.
.sk
   [If there is a system message of the day, it appears here.]
.sk
   Account? nr.car         <--Type your account and press RETURN.
   Password? XXXXXXXX      <--Type your password and press RETURN.
   [Recent NEWS items may appear here.]
.sk
   Command>

Your password will disappear as your type it.

If you respond to any of the logon prompts by typing a questions mark (?) and
pressing the RETURN key, WYLBUR displays a brief description of the possible
responses.  You can issue certain general information commands before you
actually logon, in response to the "Account?" prompt.

After you respond to the logon prompts, if there are recent NEWS items, WYLBUR
asks whether you want to read each one.  If you reply YES and then press
RETURN, WYLBUR displays the text of the NEWS item.  If you give any other
response, or just press RETURN, WYLBUR skips that NEWS item.  For more
information about the automatic NEWS feature, see the handout,
.italic 'How to Read NEWS and UPDATE,'
or type HELP NEWS at your terminal.

Once WYLBUR issues the "Command>" prompt, it is ready to accept commands.
.subsection 'Multiple Logons for One Account'
.ix 'multiple logons'
.ix logon multiple
It is possible for two or more people to logon simultaneously to the same
account.  Note that active file recovery is only possible for the first person
to logon to an account.  (See Section 2.2 for an explanation of active file
recovery.)\ When you logon to an account that allows multiple logons and it is
already in use, the following message is displayed after you type in
the account:

   Account <gg.uuu> is already logged on.
   No ACTIVE file recovery will be possible this session.
   OK to proceed (Yes/No)?

If you respond YES or OK the logon sequence continues; anything else
returns you to the "Account?" prompt.

You can request the multiple logon capability for new or existing accounts at
ITS Account Services in Forsythe Hall.  All requests must include the
signature of the account sponsor.
.section 'How to LOGOFF'
.ix 'logoff sequence'
When you complete your work and want to end your terminal session and
disconnect from the computer, notify WYLBUR by issuing a LOGOFF command.
WYLBUR replies with various statistics about your session and then disconnects
your terminal from the computer:

   Command> logoff                              <--Press RETURN
   You still have Active file(s).
        [Information on current active files appears here}
   OK to Clear (Yes/No)? yes                    <--Press RETURN
   02:15:21 elapsed time             114 disk I/O's
   1:32\CPU seconds ($1.12)          626 terminal I/O's

   Total Session Charges: $1.12
   End of session.

If you respond YES to the OK to Clear prompt and then press RETURN,
WYLBUR
clears your active(s) file and logs you off.  (See Section 2.1.1 for
an
explanation of active files.)\ If you respond NO to the OK to
Clear prompt
or if you press BREAK at this point, WYLBUR aborts the LOGOFF command and
prompts with "Command>".  Then, if you want to make a permanent copy of your
active file, you can issue a SAVE command.  (See Part II for a description of
the SAVE command.)\
.section 'WYLBUR Prompts and Commands'
WYLBUR communicates with you using prompts and messages.  The messages are
usually self-explanatory.  The prompts may be for commands, text lines, or to
ask for information or permission.  You, in turn, use commands to communicate
with WYLBUR.
.subsection 'Prompts'
WYLBUR uses four kinds of prompts:  command, line number, permission, and
information.  (You can program your own prompts using an EXEC file.  For more
information, see the
.italic 'WYLBUR EXEC File Manual,'
available in Document Sales, Forsythe Hall.)\
.point begin
.ix prompts command
Command prompts ask for instructions; you respond to these prompts with a
WYLBUR command.  The basic WYLBUR command prompt ends in an angle bracket, for
example, "Command>".  If SET TERMINAL UPPER is in effect, the command prompt
ends in a question mark, "Command?" (See Part II for a description of the SET
TERMINAL command.)\ You can change your command prompt to a string
of your choice using the SET CPROMPT command.
(See Part II for a description of the SET CPROMPT command.)\
.point
.ix prompts 'line-number'
Line number prompts simply prompt you to enter text.  For example, when WYLBUR
prompts "1.\\\>\", you can respond by typing the text you want on line number
1 The line number prompt ends in an angle bracket (>), unless SET TERMINAL
UPPER is in effect; in which case, the line number prompt ends in a question
mark (?).  To return to COMMAND mode, press BREAK in response to a line number
prompt.
.point
.ix prompts permission
Permission prompts ask for permission to do something.  For example, WYLBUR
asks "OK to Clear (Yes/No/Keep)?" when you forget to clear your
active file.  You
can respond YES, KEEP to open a new active file, or press BREAK to
terminate the process and return to a command prompt.
.point
Information prompts ask you for some specific information.  For example,
WYLBUR prompts with "Account?" and "Password?" at logon.  You must enter your
account and password to identify yourself so you can begin using the system.
.point end
.ix prompts information
.subsection 'Commands'
You may issue commands individually or collect them into an EXEC file.  (For
complete information about EXEC files, see the
.italic 'WYLBUR EXEC File Manual,'
available in Document Sales, Forsythe Hall.)\ See the Preface for a
description of the general syntax for WYLBUR commands.  (Syntax is the
notation used to express the exact form of a command.)\

.ix 'command retry'
WYLBUR does not begin processing a command you issue until you complete that
command by pressing RETURN.  At that point, the command may fail to execute
because you made a syntax error or omitted a relevant option.  The command
retry feature allows you to modify the last command issued.  If you specify
the RETRY option with the SET MODES command, you can request that WYLBUR
automatically prompt you for modifications whenever it cannot execute a
command satisfactorily.  (See Part II for a description of the SET MODES
command.)\ Otherwise, you can recall your most recently typed WYLBUR
command by typing an at-sign (@) and pressing the RETURN key.

.ix 'error message explanations'
.ix 'HELP facility' 'error messages'
When WYLBUR issues an error message in response to a command that fails to
execute, you can get an explanation of that message by responding to the next
command prompt with a question mark.  For example, suppose you issue a LIST
command and specify a line number that is not in your active file.

   Command> list 50
   Line 50 not in file.
   Command> ?
.in +3
.ju off
The error message "Line n not in file." or "Lines m/n not in file." is given
when you issue a command with an explicit range option (e.g., LIST 8/12) and
the line (or lines) you specified are not in your active file.
.ju on
.in -3

There are over 100 explanations that cover most of the WYLBUR error messages.
