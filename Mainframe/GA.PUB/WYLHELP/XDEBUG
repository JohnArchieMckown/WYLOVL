.* DESCRIPTION
The XDEBUG facility makes the debugging of EXECs easier.  It lets you watch
the execution of the EXEC and pause at specified locations.

.* SELECT 'XDEBUG Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION START
.optix START
START\\\\\\\\\\\clears all previous debugging information and traps and turns
                on the debugging facility.

.* OPTION CLEAR,CLR
.optix CLEAR
CLEAR\\\\\\\\\\\resets all debug information.  A related command SHOW XDEBUG
                displays all traps and whether or not tracing is on.

.* OPTION NEXT,N
.optix NEXT
NEXT\\\\\\\\\\\\when issued at an EXEC pause, lets you step through the EXEC,
                pausing after each executed statement.  The XGO command
                continues execution after a trap is hit.  Type HELP XGO for
                more information.

.* OPTION LOG,NOLOG
.optix LOG
.optix NOLOG
LOG|NOLOG\\\\\\\LOG types all commands at the terminal as they are executed.
                This is the simplest debugging tool, but generates by far, the
                most verbose output.  NOLOG turns command logging off.

.* OPTION TRACE,T
.optix TRACE
TRACE\{ON|TRAP|OFF}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\TRACE ON sends information to the terminal whenever a
                procedure is entered.  TRACE TRAP sends information to the
                terminal and pauses whenever a procedure is entered or exited.
                TRACE OFF turns off command tracing.  You can continue
                execution of the EXEC file with the XGO command.

.* OPTION SET TRAP,ST,CLEAR TRAP,CLR TRAP,CT,IN
.optix 'SET TRAP'
.optix 'CLEAR TRAP'
.optix IN
{SET|CLEAR} TRAP\trap-location [IN\dsname]
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\SET TRAP and CLEAR TRAP, respectively, sets or clears a trap
                in an EXEC.  A trap can be either a line number, a procedure
                name, or a procedure name followed by RETURN (to indicate the
                return from that procedure).  Once you set a trap, the EXEC
                will pause immediately before the specified line is executed.
                You can restart the EXEC with the XGO command.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\IN specifies an EXEC file in which to set or clear a trap.  If
                IN is not specified, the trap will be set for every EXEC file
                run while the XDEBUG facility is active.  For example,

                   XDEBUG SET TRAP 14

                will stop at line 14 in each EXEC called while debugging is
                on.
