ELSEIF (expression) {command|BEGIN}

.* DESCRIPTION
(** Extended EXECs only **)
The ELSEIF statement is part of a larger IF statement.  If the expression on
the IF statement is false, the ELSEIF expression is evaluated.  If it is true,
the following command or block of commands are executed and control exits the
IF loop.  There may be several ELSEIF statements on an IF statement.

The expression must evaluate to TRUE or FALSE and be enclosed in parenthese.
If there is only a single command with the ELSEIF statement, it must be on the
same line.  Otherwise, the following commands must be enclosed in BEGIN/END
statements, and the BEGIN statement must be on the same line as the WHILE
statement.

For example:

     IF (x LT 0) y = -x
     ELSEIF (x EQ 0) y = x + 1
     ELSEIF (X LT 100) y = x
     ELSE comment Enter a value under 100
