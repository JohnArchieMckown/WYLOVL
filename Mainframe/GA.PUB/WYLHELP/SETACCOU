.* DESCRIPTION
The SET ACCOUNT command allows you to set a default account other than the
account of the logged-on user.  Once you have set a default account, you can
access jobs and data sets from that account.  By issuing the SET ACCOUNT
command without options, you reset the account to that of the logged-on user.
You can use SET GROUP, in conjunction with SET USER, for the same purpose as
SET ACCOUNT.

Note that all charges for the terminal session are incurred by the logged on
user, regardless of the value of ACCOUNT.

.* OPTION GG.UUU
.optix gg.uuu
gg.uuu\\\\\\\\\\sets the default value of account to gg.uuu.  The ACCOUNT
                value will be used in forming the dsname.  During the logon
                procedure, ACCOUNT is set to the account code typed in
                response to the logon prompt "Account?".

.* OPTION PASSWORD
.optix PASSWORD
PASSWORD\\\\\\\\allows jobs and data sets belonging to the user whose account
                is specified by the values of the ACCOUNT field to be treated
                as if they belonged to the logged-on user.  You will be
                prompted for and must respond with the correct password for
                that user.  You may then SAVE, CATALOG, RECATALOG, and
                UNCATALOG data sets or PURGE, PRINT, and FETCH jobs belonging
                to that user without being prompted each time for the correct
                password.
