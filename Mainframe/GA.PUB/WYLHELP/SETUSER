.* DESCRIPTION
The SET USER command allows you to change the default value of the user code
so you can access jobs and data sets belonging to an account other than that
of the logged-on user.  To access jobs and data sets from an account with a
group code other than that of the logged-on user, you must also use the SET
GROUP command.  Note that all charges for the session are incurred by the
logged-on user, regardless of the value of USER or GROUP.

You can also use the SET ACCOUNT command to change the default values of the
USER and GROUP codes.  SHOW USER displays the current value of ACCOUNT (i.e.,
the user and group codes), as well as the logged-on ACCOUNT.

uuu\\\\\\\\\\\\\sets the default value of the user code to uuu.  The USER
                value is used in forming a dsname and in the SHOW SPACE
                command.  At logon, the value of USER is set to the user code
                of the logged-on user.  By issuing the SET USER command
                without options, the value of USER is reset to the logon
                value.

                belonging to that user without being prompted each time for
                the correct password.
