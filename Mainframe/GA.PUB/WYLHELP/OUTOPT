The output-options allow you to restrict the effect of certain JES commands to
selected groups of data sets including:

   - all spooled output or input data sets, or

   - a particular output class

You may specify these options on the JES commands ALTER, FETCH, HOLD, LOCATE,
PURGE, and RELEASE.

For ALTER, PURGE, and LOCATE output-options are valid only if the job is in
the output queue.

For HOLD, RELEASE, and FETCH (although irrelevant for FETCH), the OUTPUT
option, which refers to all output for a job, is the only valid output-option
when the job is awaiting or in execution.  However, as soon as a job has begun
execution, all other options may be used.  The valid SYSOUT output classes are

on SYSOUT classes.
