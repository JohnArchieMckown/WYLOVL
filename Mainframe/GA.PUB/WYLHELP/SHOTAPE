SHOW TAPE tape-number [account-options] [ALL|INTERNAL|TYPE] [collect-options]

.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW TAPE command displays tape information kept in the TLMS (Tape Library
Management System) data base.  SHOW TAPE displays the following information:

   - tape owner
   - first data set name
   - number of files on the tape
   - job name
   - programmer name
   - creation date and date last accessed
   - keep date
   - input use code
   - output use code
   - location code

The ALL option on the SHOW TAPE command displays more information, including a
description of the tape's location code.

The TYPE option displays generic information about a tape series, rather than
information about a specific volume.

You can issue the SHOW TAPE command for any tape for which you have at least
READ access, as determined by its RACF profile.  Type HELP SHOW PROTECT TAPE
for information about RACF profiles for tapes.

You can issue the SHOW TAPE ... TYPE command for any tape.

As with other WYLBUR SHOW commands, you can use the DUMP TAPE command to put
this information in the active file.  (Type HELP DUMP for a description of the
DUMP command.)\

.* OPTION TAPE-NUMBER
.optix tape-number
tape-number\\\\\specifies the six character ITSS tape number (reel number).

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to display the status of a tape belonging
                to an account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form
                of this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.  If this option is
                specified, you will be prompted for the password of the
                account before the command is executed.

.* OPTION ALL

               about the specific tape number, so no security restrictions
               apply.  The information is returned in a fixed-column format:

SHOW (or DUMP) TAPE ... TYPE can be used to verify that a tape number is
"plausible" -- that is, that it is syntactically valid, and belongs to a
series that exists in TLMS on some Stanford computer.  It can also be used to
determine which computer that is, and what type of tape drive is needed for
it.  Thus SHOW TAPE G12345 TYPE returns

             ....v....1....v....2....v....3....v....4....v....5
             S31N9SB   RLG scratch 3490E

So, this is a Scratch tape (col. 1=S), is used on 3490E drives (col. 5=9), and
is used on SYSB (col. 7=B).  The "description" field says essentially the same
thing, but the contents of cols. 1-7 are better suited to being parsed by an
execfile.

Note that this call does NOT verify that the particular tape number given
actually is in service, or even in the TLMS data base.  Thus, for example, if
tapes F00000 thru F20000 are defined on SYSA, SHOW TAPE F99999 TYPE will still
return "valid" information.  Verification of a specific tape number requires
looking up the specific tape in the database; that can be done only on the
machine that "owns" the tape and is subject to the security restrictions of
SHOW TAPE.
