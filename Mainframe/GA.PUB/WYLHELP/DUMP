DUMP {any\"SHOW"\command} [KEEP|CLEAR\[NOWARN]]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The DUMP command allows you to put the response from any SHOW command into
your active file.  For example, DUMP DSNAMES (instead of SHOW DSNAMES) places
all your data set names at the end of your active file.  WYLBUR always places
the response to a DUMP command at the end of your active file.

You can add the collect-options to SHOW commands to provide the same
capability.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for a description of these options.
