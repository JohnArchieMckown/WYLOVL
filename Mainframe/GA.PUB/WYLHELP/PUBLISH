PUBLISH [doc-number [EXPRESS [COPIES=n]]]

The PUBLISH command invokes an online printing facility that lets you print
Data Center documents on Forsythe and sometimes departmental printers.
For Forsythe printing, Stanford users can request ID mail delivery.

The PUBLISH facility has extensive help and instructions.  Type YES to the
initial prompt for a complete description of the facility.  Type a question
mark at any prompt for a description of your options.

.* OPTION doc-number
.optix doc-number
doc-number\\\\\\the Data Center document number of a specific document.  If you
                use this option, PUBLISH bypasses several initial prompts,
                shortening your PUBLISH session.  The document number appears
                on the cover or inside the cover of many documents; you can
                also find it through PUBLISH itself by asking for information
                about the document once you have found it by title.

.* OPTION EXPRESS
.optix EXPRESS
EXPRESS\\\\\\\\\EXPRESS tells PUBLISH not to ask you any questions about the
                order but to simply publish the document whose doc-number you
                have included in the command to the Forsythe printer for
                delivery to your Forsythe bin.  This is most useful for exec
                files that are set up to order particular documents.

.* OPTION COPIES
.optix COPIES
COPIES=n\\\\\\\\If you use the EXPRESS option, you can specify the number of
                copies you want printed.  If you omit this option, the default
                number is 1.
