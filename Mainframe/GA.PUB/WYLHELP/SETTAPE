.* DESCRIPTION
The SET TAPE command allows you to update tape entry fields in the TLMS (Tape
Library Management System) data base.  If an account is not specified, the
account of the logged-on user is assumed.

You can also use the SET TAPE command to specify where your tapes should be
stored; either in the data center in Forsythe Hall or in archive storage.
Your tape will be stored in Forsythe until you specify that it be transferred
to archive storage (with a SET TAPE ARCHIVE command) or until it has not been
accessed (read or written) for at least 400 days.  Then, unless it is an AX,
BX, ED, or EX series tape, it is automatically transferred to archive storage.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION TAPE-NUMBER
.optix tape-number
tape-number\\\\\specifies the six character ITS tape number (reel number).

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to change the status of a tape belonging
                to an account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form
                of this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.  If this option is
                specified, you will be prompted for the password of the
                account before the command is executed.

.* OPTION RELEASE,RESERVE
.optix RELEASE
.optix RESERVE
RELEASE|RESERVE\RELEASE specifies that the tape is to be released to the
                scratch pool.  Only rental tapes (the AS, BS, CS, and ES
                series) can be released to the scratch pool.  RESERVE
                specifies that the tape is to be reserved (i.e., removed from
                the scratch pool).  This is only permitted if you were the
                previous owner of the tape.  The RESERVE option allows you to
                retain a tape that has been inadvertently released to the
                scratch pool.

.* OPTION ARCHIVE,NOARCHIVE
.optix ARCHIVE
.optix NOARCHIVE
ARCHIVE|NOARCHIVE
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ARCHIVE requests that the specified tape be transferred from

                when a tape is transferred to archive storage.  NOARCHIVE
                specifies that the tape is not to be transferred to archive
                storage, regardless of how long it has been stored in
                Forsythe.  If you do not specify the ARCHIVE option, your tape
                is automatically transferred to archive storage when it has
                not been accessed (read or written) for 400 days.  This
                excludes AX, BX, ED, and EX series tapes.

.* OPTION RETRIEVE
.optix RETRIEVE

                it will be returned to archive storage without a transfer
