.* DESCRIPTION
The SET PREFIX command allows you to specify the value of dsname.  (Type HELP
DSNAME for a description of dsname.)\ You can specify the account and/or the
name portion of a fully-qualified data set name (WYL.gg.uuu.name), in addition
to the volume location of the data set.

When you change the value of the dsname with SET PREFIX and then specify *
(e.g., SAVE *), you are indicating that the prefix you set should be used in
constructing the dsname.  PREFIX (and *) refer to the complete data set name
and volume of the last data set to be used or the last PREFIX that was set.

When you access a data set by issuing the USE command, the PREFIX is
automatically set to the dsname of that data set.  The PREFIX is erased (set
to null) if you issue the CLEAR PREFIX command, or SET PREFIX without options,
or if you clear the active file.

The SHOW PREFIX command will display the current value of PREFIX.
