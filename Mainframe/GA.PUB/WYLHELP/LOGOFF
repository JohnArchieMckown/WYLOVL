.* DESCRIPTION
The LOGOFF command ends the terminal session and disconnects your terminal
from the computer.  LOGOFF, LOGOUT, and SIGNOFF are equivalent.

If your active file is not empty when you issue the LOGOFF command, WYLBUR
prompts to verify that your active file can be cleared, indicating the number
of changes made since the last USE or SAVE command.  For example:

     <n> changes, Clear ACTIVE (Yes/No)?

If you respond YES, Y, or OK, and press the RETURN key, WYLBUR clears your
active file and logs you off.  If you press the BREAK key, WYLBUR aborts the
LOGOFF command and returns you to COMMAND mode.

WYLBUR also saves your active file if the computer or WYLBUR malfunctions
("crashes" or "goes down"), or if your terminal connection is broken for any
reason.  If this happens, WYLBUR restores your active file, the next time you
logon.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION SAVE
.optix SAVE
SAVE\\\\\\\\\\\\causes the active file to be saved by WYLBUR at logoff.  The
                data set name will be the same as that of a recovered active
                file, i.e., WYL.gg.uuu.ACTIVE.

.* OPTION CLEAR,CLR
.optix CLEAR
CLEAR\\\\\\\\\\\erases the current active file.  If WARN mode is in effect and
                the changes exceed the WARN count, WYLBUR will issue a
                permission prompt indicating the number of changes made since
                the last USE or SAVE command.  WARN is the default at logon.

                logon default.  (Type HELP SET MODES WARN NOWARN for a
                description of the WARN and NOWARN modes.)\
