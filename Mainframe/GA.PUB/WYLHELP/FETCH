.* DESCRIPTION
The FETCH command copies all or part of the following into the active file:

   - the output for a job
   - the JCL for a job

WYLBUR always clears the current active file first, unless you include the
DISPLAY option.  You can also specify KEEP, which opens a new active file for
the output.  Fetching data from a job does not affect the processing of the job
in any way.  When a job is awaiting execution, you can fetch the JCL, as well as
the entire input deck as submitted.

.* SELECT 'FETCH Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION JOBID
.optix jobid
jobid\\\\\\\\\\\identifies the job(s) to be fetched.  This option is required
                and must be specified first.  Type HELP JOBID for a
                description of the various forms of jobid.

.* OPTION MULTIPLE
.optix MULTIPLE
MULTIPLE\\\\\\\\processes the command if the jobid matches more than one
                jobname in the system.  When several jobs are explicitly
                referred to by number, MULTIPLE is not necessary.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to fetch a job or jobs belonging to an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.  If this option is
                specified, you will be prompted for the password of the
                account before the command is executed.

.* OPTION QUEUE-OPTIONS,QUEUE,Q,EXEC,XEQ,OUTPUT
.optix queue-options
queue-options\\\allow further selection of jobs to be affected by the command.
                Jobs must be in the specified queue (i.e., EXEC or OUTPUT) to
                be affected.  Type HELP QUEUE-OPTIONS for a description of
                these options.

.* OPTION SETUP
.optix SETUP
SETUP\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that only the JOB and SETUP statements are to be
                fetched.  This option is effective only if the job is awaiting
                execution.

.* OPTION INPUT
.optix INPUT
INPUT\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that the job input as submitted is to be fetched.
                This includes DD * and DD DATA type input.  If the job was
                submitted via WYLBUR the JOB and JOBPARM statements may have
                data added by WYLBUR; for instance, if you specified RUN HOLD
                or directed your job to a different time block.

.* OPTION OUTPUT-OPTIONS,OUTPUT,PRINT,PUNCH,FICHE,PLOT,SYSOUT,FORMS
.optix output-options
output-options\\allow you to restrict the effect of the FETCH command to
                selected groups of data sets.  OUTPUT is the only valid
                output-option when the job is awaiting execution.  However, as
                soon as a job has begun execution, all other options may be
                used.  Type HELP OUTPUT-OPTIONS for a description of the
                output-options.

.* OPTION DEST
.optix DEST
DEST=destination
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\allow you to restrict to jobs only directed to a certain
                destination, such as an office printer or the self-service
                printer (DEST=SELF).

.* OPTION MSG,NOMSG
.optix MSG
.optix NOMSG
MSG|NOMSG\\\\\\\indicates whether or not both the JES2 job log and JCL data
                sets are to be fetched.  MSG is equivalent to LOG JCL and
                NOMSG to NOLOG NOJCL.

.* OPTION LOG,NOLOG
.optix LOG
.optix NOLOG
LOG|NOLOG\\\\\\\indicates whether or not the JES2 job log is to be fetched.
                The log contains job status and resource usage messages
                including the job's charges.

.* OPTION JCL,NOJCL
.optix JCL
.optix NOJCL
JCL|NOJCL\\\\\\\indicates whether or not the JCL is to be fetched.  This
                includes input JCL, PROC expansion, and JCL-related messages.
                When the job is awaiting execution, JCL means the JCL as
                submitted; NOJCL has no meaning.  When the job is awaiting
                output processing, JCL means the JCL and system message data
                set.

.* OPTION STEP
.optix STEP
STEP\stepname[.procstepname]
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\allows you to sepcify output by individual step.

.* OPTION DDNAME,DD
.optix DD
DDNAME\{number|ddname|stepname.ddname|stepname.procstepname.ddname}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\allows you to specify output by individual SYSOUT data set.

.* OPTION CC,MC
.optix CC
.optix MC
CC|MC\\\\\\\\\\\CC specifies that the ANSI carriage control characters are to
                be retained (in column 1) in the active file.  MC specifies
                that the machine control characters of the spooled data set
                are to be retained (in column 1) in the active file.

.* OPTION SKIP
.optix SKIP
SKIP=n\\\\\\\\\\n is any integer value.  n lines will be skipped and the
                output retrieved will start at line n+1.  This option is
                especially helpful if the output is too large to fit in the
                active file.  You may process the part fetched and later
                retrieve the rest using SKIP.

.* OPTION COUNT
.optix COUNT
COUNT=n\\\\\\\\\n specifies the number of lines to be fetched.  For example:

                   FETCH jobid COUNT=50

                would put the first 50 lines of the job's output into the
                active file.  FETCH jobid SKIP=30 COUNT=20 would fetch the
                31st through the 50th line. The maximum value for n is
                32767.

.* OPTION TRUNCATE
.optix TRUNCATE
TRUNCATE=n\\\\\\the fetched lines are truncated to n characters.  This can
                make fetched output easier to read by eliminating wrap-around
                on terminals.

.* OPTION DISPLAY
.optix DISPLAY
DISPLAY\\\\\\\\\lists the output from a job at your terminal without putting
                it in your active file.  If DISPLAY and CLEAR are both
                specified, CLEAR is ignored.

.* OPTION NUMBERED
.optix NUMBERED
NUMBERED\\\\\\\\numbers the output from the DISPLAY option.  It can be used in
                conjunction with the SQUASH option to reduce multiple blanks
                to fit better on your terminal screen.

.* OPTION SQUASH
.optix SQUASH
SQUASH\\\\\\\\\\reduces multiple blanks to a single blank when fetched output
                is displayed at your terminal with the DISPLAY option.

.* OPTION APPEND
.optix APPEND
APPEND\\\\\\\\\\appends the FETCHed file to the current contents of your
                active file.

.* OPTION TO
.optix TO
TO\line-number\\specifies the beginning line number in the active file to
                which the range of lines is to be copied.  Note that the
                active file is always cleared first.

.* OPTION BY
.optix BY
BY\increment\\\\is the line number increment, or delta, by which the
                successive line numbers of the fetched range are incremented.
                If not specified, the default value is selected.  (Type HELP
                DELTA for a description of delta.)\

.* OPTION KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR
.optix KEEP
KEEP\\\\\\\\\\\\opens a new active file for the fetched output without clearing
                the contents of the current active file.  This is the same
                as answering KEEP to the "OK\to\Clear" prompt.  The PICK
                command lets you switch between active files.

.* OPTION CLEAR,CLR
.optix CLEAR
CLEAR\\\\\\\\\\\erases the current active file (if any) before doing the
                FETCH.  The FETCH command cannot be executed until the active
                file is empty.  When you have something in your active file
                and issue a FETCH command without including the CLEAR option,
                WYLBUR will ask for permission to clear the active file.

.* OPTION NOWARN
.optix NOWARN
NOWARN\\\\\\\\\\when specified with the CLEAR option, overrides WARN mode, the
                logon default.  (Type HELP SET MODES WARN NOWARN for a
                description of the WARN and NOWARN modes.)\
