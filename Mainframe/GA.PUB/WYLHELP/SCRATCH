                PDS option or explicitly specify a null member and give a
                positive response to the verification prompt.  This option is
                required and must be specified first.  If you are scratching
                a file with Samson, add the disk drive designation before the
                the file name:  A:filename.  Type HELP DSNAME for full

VOLUME\volume\\\specified data set is located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a
