.* DESCRIPTION
The SET AUTO command allows you to change various functions that automatically
occur when you logon to your account.  These functions are in effect when your
account is opened and, unless you change them, they will remain in effect
until your account is closed.

The SHOW AUTO command displays the automatic functions currently in effect.

.* SELECT 'SET AUTO Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION GG.UUU,ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR
.optix gg.uuu
gg.uuu\\\\\\\\\\specifies the account to set the automatic functions of an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  Type HELP
                ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a description of the account-options.  If
                this option is specified, you will be prompted for the
                password of the account before the command is executed.

.* OPTION SYSTEM
.optix SYSTEM
SYSTEM\\\\\\\\\\allows you to specify which version of WYLBUR you will logon
                to each session.  WYLBUR, the default, is the regular
                production WYLBUR.  TESTWYL is a developmental version of
                WYLBUR, and OLDWYL is the the last production version of
                WYLBUR.  If TESTWYL or OLDWYL are not up, you are
                automatically logged on to WYLBUR instead.

.* OPTION COMMAND,NOCOMMAND
.optix COMMAND
.optix NOCOMMAND
COMMAND='command'|NOCOMMAND
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\COMMAND specifies a WYLBUR command to be executed every time
                you logon.  Usually this would be an EXEC FROM command.  The
                COMMAND option overrides all other SET AUTO options except the
                SYSTEM option.  NOCOMMAND undoes the effects of the COMMAND
                option, resetting all of the SET AUTO options to their
                previous values.

.* OPTION LTIME,NOLTIME
.optix LTIME
.optix NOLTIME
LTIME|NOLTIME\\\LTIME causes the time of your last logoff to be displayed each
                time you logon.  (The SHOW LTIME command displays the same
                information.)\ NOLTIME, the default for new accounts,
                specifies that the last logoff time should not be displayed at
                each logon.

.* OPTION PTIME,NOPTIME
.optix PTIME
.optix NOPTIME
PTIME|NOPTIME\\\causes the time and date of your last password change to be
                displayed at each logon if over two weeks have elapsed.
                NOPTIME, the default for new accounts, specifies that the last
                password change time should not be displayed at each logon.
                (The SHOW PTIME command also displays the time and date of
                your last password change.)  Note: WYLBUR will automatically
                display this information to you at logon regardless of the
                SET AUTO PTIME/NOPTIME setting if you haven't changed your
                password in 180 days or longer.\

.* OPTION NEWS,NONEWS
.optix NEWS
.optix NONEWS
NEWS|NONEWS\\\\\regulates the way NEWS is received.  NEWS specifies that new
                items contained in the data set NEWS PUBLIC are to be
                displayed when you logon to your account.  NEWS is the default
                for new accounts.  NONEWS specifies that news is not to be
                displayed at logon.  (The SHOW NEWS command also displays new
                items in NEWS.)\

.* OPTION MAIL,NOMAIL
.optix MAIL
.optix NOMAIL
MAIL|NOMAIL\\\\\regulates the way MAIL is received.  MAIL specifies that new
                messages (sent to your MAIL data set) are to be displayed when
                you logon to your account.  MAIL is the default for new
                accounts.  NOMAIL specifies that mail is not to be displayed
                at logon.  (The SHOW MAIL command also displays new MAIL
                items.)\

.* OPTION RECOVERY,NORECOVERY
.optix RECOVERY
.optix NORECOVERY
RECOVERY|NORECOVERY
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies whether you want automatic recovery for your active
                file.  RECOVERY, the default for new accounts, specifies that
                if an ACTIVE file had to be saved by WYLBUR when the previous
                session ended, WYLBUR will automatically USE the data set at
                your next logon and issue the message "ACTIVE saved by
                recovery last session.".  NORECOVERY specifies that an ACTIVE
                file saved by WYLBUR when the previous session ended is not to
                be automatically used at the start of the next session.  It is
                up to you (or your Logon EXEC file) to use the ACTIVE data set
                and SCRATCH it if it is not wanted.

.* OPTION EXECUTE,NOEXECUTE
.optix EXECUTE
.optix NOEXECUTE
EXECUTE|NOEXECUTE
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\EXECUTE specifies that if a member LOGON exists in your
                library called LIB, it is to be automatically executed at
                logon.  EXECUTE is the default for new accounts.  NOEXECUTE
                specifies that the Logon EXEC file is not to be automatically
                executed, even if you have a member LOGON in your library.

.* OPTION MULTIPLE,NOMULTIPLE,XMULTIPLE
.optix MULTIPLE
.optix NOMULTIPLE
.optix XMULTIPLE
MULTIPLE|XMULTIPLE|NOMULTIPLE
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\MULTIPLE specifies that the account can be logged on multiple
                times simultaneously.  Each session is an independent session.
                Sessions are differentiated by a number WYLBUR adds to the
                account; for instance, GQ.PUB's first session is labelled
                GQ.PUB, the second is GQ.PUB#2, etc.  Note that only the first
                session has WYLBUR active file recovery.  A warning about that
                appears during logon time for the second or third (etc.)
                session, along with a prompt asking if it's ok to continue
                the logon sequence under that condition.  The XMULTIPLE option
                suppresses that prompt (but not the warning) so that the logon
                sequence doesn't stop to ask it.  The NOMULTIPLE option turns
                off multiple logon privileges for an account.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the SET AUTO
                command into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for
                a description of these options.

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that all system responses be suppressed, if the
                command is successful.
