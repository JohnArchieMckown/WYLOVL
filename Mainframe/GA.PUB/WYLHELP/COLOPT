.* DESCRIPTION
The collect-options can be added to most WYLBUR commands that display
information (e.g., SHOW NEWS, SHOW DSNAMES, SHOW LTIME) to place the
information in your active file.  For example:

   Command> show ltime collect clear
   Line 1 is the last line.
   Command> list
   \\\\1.\\\\ Last logoff at 12:36

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION LINE-NUMBER
.optix line-number
line-number\\\\\begins collecting the lines into the active file at the
                specified line number.  If this option is omitted, then
                collecting will begin at the end of your active file.

.* OPTION BY
.optix BY
BY\increment\\\\specifies the line increment or delta to be used.  If the
                line-number option was specified, but BY was not, the default
                value is chosen according to the default delta rule.  Type
                HELP DELTA for a description of delta.

.* OPTION KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR
.optix KEEP
KEEP\\\\\\\\\\\\opens a new Active file without clearing the contents of the
                current one.  This is the same as answering KEEP to the
                "OK\to\Clear" prompt.  The PICK command lets you restore the
                previous active file.

.* OPTION CLEAR,CLR
.optix CLEAR
CLEAR\\\\\\\\\\\clears the active file and opens a new one before the new
                lines are collected.

.* OPTION NOWARN
.optix NOWARN
NOWARN\\\\\\\\\\when specified with the CLEAR option, overrides WARN mode, the
                logon default.  (Type HELP SET MODES WARN NOWARN for a
                description of the WARN and NOWARN modes.)\
