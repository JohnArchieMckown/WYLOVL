The length-options are used to override the value of LENGTH (established with
the SET LENGTH command) for the duration of a command.  You may specify length
options on most editing commands.

                characters, a warning is given.

.* OPTION NOLENGTH
.optix NOLENGTH
NOLENGTH\\\\\\\\means that no warning is given unless the line becomes too

.us NOTES:

   1.\The form LENGTH=n is rarely used on editing commands.  It is more
      convenient to SET LENGTH n before a sequence of editing commands and
      then set it back to its previous value rather than specifying it for
      each command in the sequence.

   2.\NOLENGTH is often specified with the CHANGE and MODIFY commands when
      intermediate changes are expected to cause lines to be longer than the
      LENGTH setting.

   3.\NOLENGTH is abbreviated NOLE or NOLEN because NOL is an abbreviation for
      NOLIST.
