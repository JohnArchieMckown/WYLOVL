HOLD jobid [MULTIPLE] [account-options] [queue-options] [output-options]
     [OUTGRP=group] [DEST=destination] [collect-options] [QUIET]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The HOLD command allows you to stop the processing of a job or jobs at certain
key points.  When you specify the HOLD command without an output or queue
option, the system determines the HOLD point.  Jobs waiting for execution are
placed in user hold and jobs in execution or the output queue are placed in
output hold.  You can specify HOLD as an option on the RUN command.  Type HELP
RUN HOLD for more information.

The RELEASE command releases a job from HOLD status.  Type HELP RELEASE for a
description of RELEASE.

.* OPTION JOBID
.optix jobid
jobid\\\\\\\\\\\identifies the job(s) to be held.  This option is required and
                must be specified first.  Type HELP JOBID for a description of
                the various forms of jobid.

.* OPTION MULTIPLE
.optix MULTIPLE
MULTIPLE\\\\\\\\causes the command to be processed if the jobid matches more
                than one jobname in the system.  When several jobs are
                explicitly referred to by number, the MULTIPLE option is not
                necessary.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to hold a job or jobs belonging to an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.  If this option is
                specified, you will be prompted for the password of the
                account before the command is executed.

.* OPTION QUEUE-OPTIONS,QUEUE,Q,EXEC,XEQ,OUTPUT
.optix queue-options
queue-options\\\allow further selection of jobs to be affected by the command.
                Jobs must be in the specified queue (i.e., EXEC or OUTPUT) to
                be affected.  Type HELP QUEUE-OPTIONS for a description of
                these options.

.optix output-options

                selected groups of data sets.  OUTPUT is the only valid
                output-option when the job is awaiting execution.  However, as
                soon as a job has begun execution, other options may be used.
                Type HELP OUTPUT-OPTIONS for a description of the
                output-options.

.* OPTION OUTGRP
.optix outgrp

.* OPTION DEST
