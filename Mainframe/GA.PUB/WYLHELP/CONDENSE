.* DESCRIPTION
The CONDENSE command removes the dead space in a library to allow additional
members to be saved.  (Type HELP LIBRARY for a definition of library.)\ A job
is submitted to condense the specified library using the COMPRESS option of
the IBM utility IEBCOPY.  A notify message is sent to your terminal when the
CONDENSE is complete (e.g., 12:20 JOB 1234 EABCOND ENDED\\CONDENSE=0).  The
jobname of a CONDENSE job has a special form, uuuCOND (instead of the usual
uuuggnnn), where uuu, the user code is combined with COND (e.g., EABCOND) to
make the job easier to recognize as a CONDENSE job.  If the CONDENSE fails
(i.e., if you get any number other than zero in the CONDENSE= portion of the
notify message), the job is placed in OUTPUT HOLD.

Whenever WYLBUR cannot complete an attempted SAVE of a library member because
of insufficient space in the data set, it prompts you with:

     Condense (Yes/No)?

To have the library condensed, type YES or OK.  After an affirmative reply,
you may specify the BIN, ID, LIST, BLOCK, NONOTIFY, and/or HOLD options (on
the same line).  Once the CONDENSE job is completed, you can issue your SAVE
command again.

You can usually recover a "scratched" or replaced library member until your
library is condensed.  CONDENSE should be used cautiously if you want to take
advantage of this backup feature.

.* SELECT 'CONDENSE Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION DSNAME
.optix dsname
dsname\\\\\\\\\\is the name of the specified library (PDS) to be condensed.
                (Type HELP DSNAME for a description of dsname.)\ This option
                is required and must be specified first.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to condense a library belonging to an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.  WYLBUR will prompt
                you with:

                   <dsname> is not yours.
                   OK (Yes/No)?

                before the command is executed.  This does NOT bypass the
                security system, so if you reply OK when you don't have access
                to the data set, the CONDENSE job WYLBUR submits for you will
                ABEND S913.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME
.optix ON
ON\volume\\\\\\\indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ If
                this option is not specified, the volume set with the SET
                VOLUME command will be searched; if no volume is set, the
                system catalog, an index of data sets, will be searched for
                the data set name and volume location.  (All data sets are
                automatically cataloged when they are saved, unless you
                specify otherwise.)\

.* OPTION LIST
.optix LIST
LIST\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that the output from the submitted CONDENSE job be
                printed on a line-printer.

.* OPTION NOHOLD
.optix NOHOLD
NOHOLD\\\\\\\\\\specifies that even if the CONDENSE job fails, it is not to be
                placed in output HOLD.

.* OPTION NONOTIFY
NONOTIFY\\\\\\\\specifies that a notify message is not requested for the
                CONDENSE job.
