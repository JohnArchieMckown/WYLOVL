.* DESCRIPTION
The EXECUTE command executes a series of WYLBUR commands.  You can indicate
your active file or an external disk file as the source of the commands to be
executed.  Then, WYLBUR copies the contents of the file you specified into the
EXEC file space for execution.  If you specify neither, WYLBUR executes the
commands that are currently in the EXEC file space (also called the EXEC
file).  When you indicate an external file in the EXECUTE command, your active
file is not affected.  If you indicate all or part of your active file, WYLBUR
deletes the active file or the indicated portion, unless you specify NODELETE.

If you are in SPIRES, you must have WYLBUR set or EXEC files will not work.
Type EXPLAIN SET WYLBUR (while in SPIRES) for more information on the SET
WYLBUR command and its effects.

WYLBUR executes the commands sequentially unless a branch command (i.e.,
EXECUTE line-number) is specified.  Execution of commands continues until one
of the following occurs:  the end of the file is reached, an EXEC BREAK
occurs, or an EXECUTE command with the PAUSE option is executed from the file.

An EXEC BREAK occurs when a command being executed in the EXEC file is aborted
for any reason (e.g., you pressed the BREAK key or the command was incorrectly
specified).  You can type EXECUTE NEXT or simply EXECUTE to continue executing
the command immediately following the command that caused the EXEC BREAK.  To
continue by re-executing the interrupted command, type the command EXECUTE
CURRENT.

A pointer is maintained to the currently executing line in the EXEC file.
This pointer is distinct from the pointer to the CURRENT line number in the
active file.  The command SHOW CURRENT EXECUTE returns the value of the
pointer to the CURRENT line in the EXEC file.

Type HELP XCALL for information on executing extended EXECs.

.* SELECT 'EXECUTE Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION START
.optix START
[START=]line-number
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the line number where execution should begin.  The
                word START is optional.  If the line number does not exist,
                WYLBUR begins execution at the next line encountered.  If this
                option is omitted and either the ACTIVE or FROM dsname option
                is specified, execution begins at the first line in the file.
                If neither this option nor a file is specified, WYLBUR begins
                execution at the symbolic line number NEXT of the file loaded
                in the EXEC file space.

.* OPTION RETURN
.optix RETURN
RETURN\\\\\\\\\\causes the EXEC file to branch to the line number RETURN that
                was set by either an EXECUTE SAVE or a SET RETURN command.

.* OPTION SAVE
.optix SAVE
SAVE\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that the symbolic line number RETURN should be set
                to the line number of the next line of the EXEC file.  This
                provides a branch and link capability within an EXEC file or a
                set of EXEC files.  To illustrate the use of RETURN and SAVE,
                assume an EXEC file contains the command EXECUTE SAVE at line
                11.  This causes the symbolic line number RETURN to be set to
                the next line; let's assume 12.  Further, assume the command
                EXECUTE RETURN is at line 20.  This would cause the command at
                the line number RETURN, i.e., line 12, to be executed.

.* OPTION ACTIVE
.optix ACTIVE
ACTIVE\\\\\\\\\\specifies that the EXEC file space should be loaded from the
                active file.  If neither ACTIVE nor FROM dsname is specified,
                the current EXEC file is assumed.

.* OPTION NODELETE
.optix NODELETE
NODELETE\\\\\\\\prevents the active file, or the specified portion of it, from
                being deleted after it has been loaded into the EXEC file
                space.

.* OPTION FROM
.optix FROM
FROM\dsname\\\\\specifies that the EXEC file is to be loaded from an external
                file.  If neither ACTIVE nor FROM dsname is specified, the
                current EXEC file is assumed.  Type HELP DSNAME for a
                description of dsname.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR,PUBLIC
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to execute commands from an external disk
                file belonging to an account other than that of the logged-on
                user.  One form of this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP
                ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a description of the account-options.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME
.optix ON
ON\volume\\\\\\\indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ If
                this option is not specified, the volume set with the SET
                VOLUME command will be searched; if no volume is set, the
                system catalog, an index of data sets, will be searched for
                the data set name and volume location.  (All data sets are
                automatically cataloged when they are saved, unless you
                specify otherwise.)\

.* OPTION FORMAT-OPTIONS,EDIT,CARD,PRINT,LRECL,NUMBERED,INTEGER,UNNUMBERED,SEQFLD
.optix format-options
format-options\\allow you to specify the record length and the treatment of
                WYLBUR line numbers of the data set being loaded.  Type HELP
                FORMAT-OPTIONS for a description of these options.

.* OPTION LINES,LINS
.optix LINES
LINES=range\\\\\specifies the range of lines in the active or external file to
                be loaded into the EXEC file space.  Either the ACTIVE or FROM
                dsname option must be used with this option.  If ACTIVE is
                used, the range will be deleted from the active file once it
                is loaded unless NODELETE is also specified.  If a disjoint
                explicit range is given, it must be in ascending order.  Type
                HELP RANGE for a description of range.  Note that when
                referring to an external file, the symbolic line numbers FIRST
                and LAST have the values 0 and 99999.999 respectively.  Thus,
                LINES=FIRST/LAST for an external file would mean
                LINES=0/99999.999.

.* OPTION PARM,NOPARM
.optix PARM
.optix NOPARM
PARM={'text'|"text"|(text)|/text}|NOPARM
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\PARM sets the parameter field.  For example, the command
                EXECUTE FROM #FIND PARM='SAMPLE' will set the PARM variable to
                "sample".  If PARM is omitted on either EXECUTE FROM or
                EXECUTE ACTIVE the PARM variable is set to null.  On all other
                types of EXECUTE commands the value of PARM remains unchanged
                unless a PARM is explicitly stated.  For example, the command
                EXECUTE FROM #TEST will reset PARM to null, but EXECUTE 13
                will leave PARM unchanged.  A NOPARM option can be used on
                EXECUTE FROM or EXECUTE ACTIVE to override the default null
                parameter and leave PARM unchanged.  For example, the command
                EXECUTE FROM #LIBLIST PUBLIC NOPARM will not change the PARM
                value (convenient for EXEC files that call other EXEC files).

.* OPTION PAUSE
.optix PAUSE
PAUSE\\\\\\\\\\\interrupts the execution of the EXEC file; control is returned
                to you and no commands are executed from the file.  You can
                continue execution by typing EXECUTE.

.* OPTION CLEAR,CLR
.optix CLEAR
CLEAR\\\\\\\\\\\clears the EXEC file space.  You use CLEAR with ACTIVE or FROM
                dsname to avoid a prompt to clear the EXEC file space before
                the new file is loaded.

.* OPTION LOG,NOLOG
.optix LOG
.optix NOLOG
LOG|NOLOG\\\\\\\LOG specifies that all commands should be listed before
                execution.  NOLOG, the logon default, suppresses the listing
                of commands before execution.
