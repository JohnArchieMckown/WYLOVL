.* DESCRIPTION
The LPRINT command prints either the active file, EXEC file or an external
file on the printer attached to local (desktop) computer running Samson.
It also works on a VT100-compatible terminal with a printer attached.

The SET LPRINT command tells the system which kind of printer you are using,
to make use of any special support available for that printer.  Type HELP SET
LPRINT for details.  Special support is currently available for the
Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer; pages are reversed as they are printed to
end in the correct order, and you can specify landscape printing on the
LaserJet.

The JPRINT command lets you print a job in the output queue on the printer
attached to your PC or terminal.  Type HELP JPRINT for details.

.ix 'OPTIONS: line' 'with LPRINT Command'
If the first line or lines in the range to be printed begin with "OPTIONS:",
then the remaining text in those "OPTIONS:" lines can specify PRINT options
that should be used to print the remaining lines of text.  The "OPTIONS:" line
itself does not get printed.  A sample "OPTIONS:" line might be:
.'ix ';'

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the range of lines to be printed.  If a range is not
                specified, the entire active file will be printed.  If this
                option is used, it must be specified first.  Type HELP RANGE
                for a description of range.

.* OPTION EXECUTE
.optix EXECUTE
EXECUTE\\\\\\\\\specifies that all or part of the EXEC file is to be listed.
                If this option is not specified, all or part of the active
                file is listed.

.* OPTION FROM
.optix FROM
FROM\dsname\\\\\specifies an external data set to be submitted for printing
                (instead of the active or EXEC file).

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME
.optix ON
ON\volume\\\\\\\indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ If
                this option is not specified, the data set is located by
                searching the system catalog (normally all data sets are
                cataloged).\

.* OPTION FORMAT-OPTIONS,EDIT,CARD,LPRINT,LRECL
.optix format-options
format-options\\allow you to specify the record length and the treatment of
                WYLBUR line numbers in the data set to be used.  (Type HELP
                FORMAT-OPTIONS for a description of these options.)\

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\LIST, the default for this command, lists the text and line
                numbers of the specified range.  The UNNUMBERED option lists
                only the text of the lines in the range and shifts the text to
                the left.  NOTEXT suppresses printing of the text and lists
                only the numbers.  NONUMBERED lists the text only and replaces
                the line number with blanks.  For a description of all the
                list options, type HELP LIST-OPTIONS.

.* OPTION HEX,MIXED
.optix HEX
.optix MIXED
HEX|MIXED\\\\\\\HEX specifies that the listing be in hexadecimal
                representation.  MIXED causes all nonprinting (control)
                characters to be displayed in their EBCDIC hexadecimal format,
                enclosed in angle brackets.  For example, <270C> represents
                the two characters X'27' and X'0C'.

.* OPTION UNFORMATTED
.optix UNFORMATTED
UNFORMATTED\\\\\prints any special WYLBUR formatting instructions like those
                for bold, italic, and underlining instead of executing them.
                FORMATTED is the default.

.* OPTION CC,MC
.optix CC
.optix MC
CC|MC\\\\\\\\\\\CC or MC causes the character in column 1 of each line in the
                range to be treated as a printer control character.  MC is
                valid only for files with machine control (MC) characters such
                as those normally created by some of the IBM assemblers or
                compilers or fetched using the MC parameter.

.* OPTION NOCC,NOMC
.optix NOCC
.optix NOMC
NOCC|NOMC\\\\\\\overrides the CC and MC options.  This option is only useful
                if either CC or MC is included in an OPTIONS: line in the
                data set you want printed.

.* OPTION COLUMNS,COLS
.optix COLUMNS
COLUMNS=m[/n]\\\will cause only columns m through n of a line to be listed.
                If the COLUMNS option is not specified, m defaults to column
                1; n to column 235.  (The actual number of columns that can be
                printed depends on the options: FORMS, CHARS, and
                list-options.)\

.* OPTION MARKER
.optix MARKER
MARKER=c\\\\\\\\causes a page eject at any point in the range where there is a
                marker character in column 1 (c is any character).  Lines with
                the marker character in column 1 will not be printed.  Enclose
                the marker character in quotation marks or apostrophes if it is
                a lowercase letter or one of these characters:  ( ) " ' ,

.* OPTION INDENT
.optix INDENT
INDENT=n\\\\\\\\inserts n blanks at the left of each listed line.  If INDENT=0
                is specified, printer control characters are assumed to be in
                column 1 of each line of the file and the UNNUMBERED
                list-option is assumed.  CC characters are expected unless the
                MC option is also used.  CC or MC alone may be used to get
                numbered listings with carriage control.

.* OPTION DOUBLE,TRIPLE
.optix DOUBLE
.optix TRIPLE
DOUBLE|TRIPLE\\\produce a listing with double or triple spacing, respectively.
                Single spacing is the default.

.* OPTION EJECT,NOEJECT
.optix EJECT
.optix NOEJECT
EJECT=n|NOEJECT\EJECT specifies the number of lines to be printed before the
                page is ejected.  This number must be between 0 and 255.  If
                EJECT is not specified, a page eject will occur after 60 lines
                of printing.  NOEJECT permits lines to be printed to the
                bottom of the page and over the page perforations.

.* OPTION DARK
.optix DARK
DARK[=n]\\\\\\\\produces an offline listing in which each line is printed two
                (or n if n is specified) times.  Sometimes overprinting can
                facilitate better reproduction.  This option reduces printing
                speed considerably and increases your lines-printed charge by
                n.  (This option is valid only for impact printers.)\

.* OPTION TITLE
.optix TITLE
TITLE='title'\\\permits a title of up to 72 characters to be printed on the
                output after the JCL and before the listing of the file.  The
                first 20 characters will also appear on the job header and
                trailer sheets.

.* OPTION LANDSCAPE
.optix LANDSCAPE
LANDSCAPE\\\\\\\requests printing in landscape orientation with the lines
                parallel to the long side of the page.

.* OPTION CHARS
.optix CHARS
CHARS=a|(a,b[,c[,d]])
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies one or multiple character sets.

.* OPTION COPIES
.optix COPIES
COPIES=nn\\\\\\\allows up to 99 copies to be made of the output.  If this
                option is not specified, one copy will be printed.

.* OPTION MANUAL
.optix MANUAL
MANUAL\\\\\\\\\\prints every page of the job through the manual feeder.  This
                is useful for printing on special forms without refilling the
                paper tray.  This option works only on LaserJet and
                LaserWriter printers.

.* OPTION FMANUAL
.optix FMANUAL
FMANUAL\\\\\\\\\prints the first page of a job on paper fed through the
                manual feeder.  This is useful if you want to print only the
                first page of a letter on letterhead.  If you are printing
                multiple copies, the first page of each copy prints through
                the manual feeder.  This option only works on LaserJet or
                LaserWriter printers.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the LPRINT command
                into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for a
                description of these options.

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\requests that all system responses be suppressed if the LPRINT
                command is successful.
