.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW ACTIVE command displays the name, number of lines, and change count
of a specified active file.  If you do not specify an active file, it displays
information about the current active file.

For example, the SHOW ACTIVE command could return:

=>   3 JAN86    From LIB#JAN86                     51 lines, 11 changes


The SHOW ACTIVES command displays your active file stack, with the number of
each active file and a description of its contents.  You can move between
active files using the PICK command followed by the number of the active file
you want.

Sample Display from SHOW ACTIVES Command:

     2 NEW                                          8 lines, 13 changes
     3 MEMO     From LIB#MEMO                      94 lines
=>   5 FETCHED  Fetched job output                  9 lines

The arrow indicates the current active file.

To recover a CLEARed active file, type the command SHOW ACTIVES ALL:

     1 NEW                                          2 lines (Cleared)
     2 FETCHED  Fetched job output                  9 lines
     3 MEMO     From LIB#MEMO                      94 lines
     4 CHAP1    From THESIS#CHAP1                 111 lines (Cleared)
=>   5 NEW      Newly collected text                8 lines, 13 changes

The cleared active files have a (Cleared) indication.  The last active file
you cleared is always saved.  To retrieve it, type the command PICK n, where n
is the number of the active file.
