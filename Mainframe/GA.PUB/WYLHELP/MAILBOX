Mailbox

You can use the WYLBUR Mail Facility to send messages to users who have a
mailbox with either of the following commands:

MAIL\\\is used to send messages from your active file.  Type HELP MAIL for a
       description of the command.

SEND\\\is used to send one-line messages from the command line.  Type HELP
       SEND for a description of the command.

Following are descriptions of how to receive and read mail when using the
WYLBUR Mail Facility.

How to Receive MAIL
-------------------

To receive electronic mail from other users, issue the SET MAIL command.  Then
any mail sent to you will be saved under your account in a mailbox (a data set
called MAIL).   Type HELP SET MAIL for a description of SET MAIL.

Any new mail you receive between terminal sessions is displayed automatically
the next time you logon, unless you change the default (SET AUTO MAIL).  To do
so, issue the command:

   Command> SET AUTO NOMAIL

If you receive mail while you are logged on, you will be notified with a
message like the following:

     15:26 Mail received from E1.ABC "W. Nelson" (34); 2 lines

.* PROMPT 'Do you want information about reading mail'
Reading MAIL
------------

Messages received through MAIL are displayed at your terminal as shown below:

     14:08:11 08/18/82 FROM B4.XYZ "P. Wallingford": SAMPLE MAIL
     [This is a sample MAIL message that can be erased by responding "YES"
      to the "Delete?" prompt.]
     Delete?

WYLBUR precedes the MAIL message with a line that includes the time and date
the message was sent, the account number of the sender, and a name and title
(if specified by the sender).  The text of the message is then listed,
followed by a "Delete?" prompt.

Following are the acceptable responses to the "Delete?" prompt:

   NO
   (or N or RETURN key)
                causes the message to remain in your MAIL data set and to
                appear the next time your mail is displayed.

   DELETE
   (or D, YES, Y, OK)
                causes the item to be erased from your MAIL data set.

   LIST
   (or L)
                lists the same item again (starting at the
                beginning of the item).

   COLLECT [CLEAR|KEEP]
                puts the mail message at the end of your active file.
                You can use the CLEAR or KEEP option to clear the
                current active file or open a new active file.

   PRINT [options]
                prints the mail message on the Forsythe printers or
                an office printer.  Type HELP PRINT for a
                description of the PRINT command options.)\

   LPRINT [options]
                prints the message on the printer attached directly
                to your microcomputer or terminal.  Type HELP LPRINT
                for more information.

   KEEP [subject]
   (or K [subject])
                keeps the message in your MAIL data set.  The
                "subject" is an optional 1 to 8 character name that can be
                used to categorize the item.  Once you KEEP a mail item, it is
                not displayed again until you issue a SHOW MAIL KEPT or a
                SHOW\MAIL\ALL command.  (Type HELP SHOW MAIL for a
                description of the SHOW MAIL command and its options.)\ Note
                that the DUMP MAIL KEPT command will put your KEPT mail in
                your active file.  (Type HELP DUMP for a description of the
                DUMP command.)\

   QUIT         quits reading mail and returns you to the command
                prompt.

   CANCEL       quits reading mail, returns you to the command prompt, and
                undoes any "delete" or "keep" requests you have made since
                you issued the SHOW MAIL command.
