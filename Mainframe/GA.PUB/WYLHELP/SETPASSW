.* DESCRIPTION
The SET PASSWORD command changes the password of your Data Center account.
To change the password of an account other than that of the logged-on user,
include the account in the command.  When you issue the SET PASSWORD command,
WYLBUR first prompts for the old password and then prompts twice for the new
password.  Consider the following example:

   Command> set password
   Enter your current password.
   Password? fudge
   Enter your new password.
   Password? truffle
   Enter the same new password again for verification.
   Password? truffle

You choose your password; it consists of a string of any alphanumeric
characters and it can be from 5 to 8 characters in length.  You enter it each
time you logon, in response to the "Password?" prompt. You should change
it the first time you logon to your account and at least every two weeks
thereafter.
