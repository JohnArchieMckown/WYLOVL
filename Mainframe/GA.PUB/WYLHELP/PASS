PASS command

.* DESCRIPTION
The PASS command allows you to pass a command to the current ORVYL program
without having WYLBUR look at it.  This is useful when the ORVYL program and
WYLBUR both recognize the same command.  For example, you could pass the
SPIRES ALLOCATE command to SPIRES with the command:

        PASS ALLOCATE VGROUPNAME
