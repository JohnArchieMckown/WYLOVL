.* DESCRIPTION
The SET ALIASES command lets you set from 0 to 3 aliases for your account.
Aliases can be used in all places where your UserID can be specified, and in
many places where your account number can be specified, such as in response to
the "Account?" prompt at logon, or in commands such as MAIL TO, SHOW LINE,
SHOW NAME, and SHOW MAIL.

Unlike your UserID, which is displayed in mail headers when you send mail to
others (among other places), your aliases are seldom seen by others, unless
they use the SHOW ALIASES command to see your aliases.  For more general
information about aliases and UserIDs, see the document "UserIDs on the
Forsythe Computer" (DOC#USERIDS PUBLIC), available through the PUBLISH
command:  PUBLISH 957 for a printed or online copy.

The aliases you set with this command remain in effect permanently, but can be
reset anytime you want.  To see your aliases, use the SHOW ALIASES command.

Each time you issue this command, the list of aliases you specify completely
replaces the previous list of aliases.  So if you have three aliases and want
to change one of the three to something else, you must type all three of the
ones you want on this command.
