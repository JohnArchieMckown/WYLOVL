.* DESCRIPTION
The SEND command sends a one-line message from the command line to a user (or
users) who has a mailbox.  WYLBUR sends and stores the message whether or not
the recipient is logged on.  You can also issue a TO command to send a
one-line message from the command line, but only to a currently logged-on
user.  (Type HELP TO for a description of the command.)\

Use the MAIL command to send a message from your active file to users who have
