.* DESCRIPTION
The SET PROTECT command allows you to set (or remove) access rules for your
disk or tape data sets by creating or modifying profiles.  An access rule is an
association between either an account or group and an access level (e.g.
PUBLIC NONE or gg.uuu ALTER).  A profile is a collection of access rules which
protect all disk data sets that match the profile name.  Only the owner of a
profile can set or change these access rules.  A profile and access rule are
automatically created the first time the profile name is used in a SET PROTECT
command.  Every account has an account default profile which will protect all
newly created disk data sets unless protected by another more specific profile.
Tape profiles are created at the time that the first file on the tape is
written.  The profile is derived from the profile which would protect the tape
data set if it were on disk.  Once the tape profile is automatically created, it
can be modified via the [TAPE tapeno] options on this command.  New tape
profiles can't be created by this command because you must be the owner of the
tape in order to issue this command.

Read DOC#PROTECT PUB for more information about disk security.

The SHOW PROTECT command is used to examine access rules and may be issued by
all users who have any level of access to the profile.  Type HELP SHOW PROTECT
for a description the SHOW PROTECT command.

EXAMPLES:       SET PROTECT DEFAULT FOR PUBLIC NONE
                SET PROTECT DEFAULT FOR GROUP gg REMOVE

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION DEFAULT
.optix DEFAULT
DEFAULT\\\\\\\\\Refers to the RACF default profile.  If no other protection
                applies, then a data set will be protected by the default.
                Your default profile can have multiple access rules in effect
                simultaneously.  Each new access rule must be added with a new
                SET PROTECT DEFAULT command.  An access rule may be removed
                using the REMOVE option.   To see your current default
                protection issue the command SHOW PROTECT DEFAULT.  To see how
                all your datasets are protected issue the command SHOW
                PROTECT ALL.  Note: tape profiles are not displayed as part
                part of this command at this time.  Tape profiles can only be
                seen by issuing the SHOW PROTECT TAPE [tapeno] command.

                If you wish no one to have access to datasets protected by
                your default profile and the default profile has one or more
                existing access rules, each access rule must be REMOVEd.  The
                end result will be no non-owner access allowed (e.g. Public
                None).  Issuing the command SET PROTECT DEFAULT FOR PUBLIC NONE
                will simply add one more access rule to the existing rules and
                will probably not accomplish what you want.

                The default profile may not be deleted.  The default profile
                is not the same as the WYL.gg.uuu.* profile.  The default
                profile protects non-Wylbur data sets in addition to all WYL.
                data sets.  Do not SET PROTECT WYL.gg.uuu.* in place of the
                more general SET PROTECT DEFAULT command.

.* OPTION profilename
.optix profilename
profilename\\\\\Specifies either a single disk data set name or a group of
                commonly named disk data sets by substituting wildcards for
                variable parts of data set names.  An '*' wildcard substitutes
                for multiple characters and the '%' wildcard substitutes for a
                single character.  If an '*' occurs as the last symbol in the
                profile name then it can substitute for multiple levels of
                data set names.  If not at the end, then the '*' can only
                substitute for the trailing part of a single level or the
                whole level.  When the profile name identifies a library
                (partitioned data set), a member name must not be specified.
                The access rule applies to an entire library rather than
                individual members.  Typical profile names might be:  MASTER,
                LIB*, INPUT.*.DAILY, FILE%%93.

.* OPTION TAPE
.optix TAPE
TAPE\\\\\\\\\\\Specifies that an existing tape profile is to be modified.

.* OPTION tapeno
.optix tapeno
tapeno\\\\\\\\\\Identifies the volume ID for which you want to modify the tape
                profile.  You must either own or have ALTER access to the tape
                profile before you can use this command.

.* OPTION @TAPE
.optix @TAPE
@TAPE\\\\\\\\\\\requests that the tape protection default profile be defined.
                This profile is used to set tape profiles (rather than using
                the matching dataset profile) when the owner account is
                different from the account imbedded in the dataset name.

.* OPTION DELETE
.optix DELETE
DELETE\\\\\\\\\\Deletes a profile and all its associated access-rules.
                Data sets formerly protected by the specified profile name
                will now be protected by the next most definitive profile name
                (possibly the account default.) The account default may not be
                deleted.  You may want to issue the SHOW PROTECT ALL command
                before and after deleting a profile to be sure of the results.

.* OPTION RESET
.optix RESET
RESET\\\\\\\\\\\Resets the access rule to the account default.  RESET may be
                used with a single access rule.  In this case the resetting is
                performed first, and then the specified permit is established.

.* OPTION FOR
.optix FOR
FOR\\\\\\\\\\\\\Required for most forms of the SET PROTECT command.  This word
                separates the profile name from the access rule
                (target-accounts and access-options).  Not required if DELETE
                or RESET options alone are specified.

.* OPTION ACCESS-RULE,ACCESS,ACCOUNT,GROUP,READ,UPDATE,ALTER,PUBLIC
.optix access-rule
access-rule\\\\\{gg.uuu|GROUP gg|USER uuu|COMMUNITY|PUBLIC|racfgroup}
                {REMOVE|NONE|READ|UPDATE|CONTROL|ALTER}

An access-rule is made up of a combination of a target and an access option.
The target can be specified in the following ways:

target-accounts\{gg.uuu|GROUP gg|USER uuu|COMMUNITY|PUBLIC|racfgroup}
                The first part of the access rule, the target accounts specify
                the accounts or groups of accounts to which you are granting
                or denying file access.  It may be specified as follows:

                gg.uuu       A single account being given access.
                GROUP gg     An accounting group.
                USER uuu     Another user in the same group as logged on user.
                COMMUNITY    Translates to either ADMIN, INTERNAL or RLIN
                             depending on the logged on user's group code.
                PUBLIC       Refers to all accounts.

                racfgroup    A RACF defined group of users.
                RACF only    A racfgroup can be an unlimited number of
                             accounts.  Type HELP RACF or HELP RACF ADDGROUP
                             for further information.

Access-options\\describe the type of access granted to the target account(s).
                If there is an access rule for a particular account which is a
                member of other groups having access, the account level access
                takes precedence over the group access(es).  If an account
                belongs to more than one group, the least restrictive access
                is granted.  (E.g.  group GG has READ access and group TEST
                has UPDATE access, then account gg.uuu which belongs to both
                groups has UPDATE access.) The available access options are:

                REMOVE, NONE, READ, UPDATE, CONTROL, ALTER

                Type HELP ACCESS for detailed descriptions of these options.

.* OPTION NEWPROFILE
.optix NEWPROFILE
NEWPROFILE\\\\\\Unless this option is specified, all the access rules which
                come from the parent profile will be appended to this profile.
                Normally, when a new profile is created, most users want the
                same access rules from the parent profile plus an additional
                rule to give a new person access.  Occasionally the opposite
                is wanted and by specifying this option, the appending will
                not take place.  This option is ignored whenever you are
                adding a new access-rule to an existing profile.

.* OPTION LOG
.optix LOG
LOG\\\\\\\\\\\\\Lets you turn on/off various logging options.  Only the owner
                of the data set may set or change the access logging.  The log
                records will be sent to the profile owner unless an alternate
                distribution rule is specified with the 'NOTIFY gg.uuu'
                option.  The log-options are hierarchical where each higher
                option includes all log records from lower level options.

.* OPTION NONE
.optix NONE
NONE\\\\\\\\\\\\Turns off all logging for the specified profile.  This is
                the default for all accounts except for those that are defined
                as "sensitive." All accounts with double password protection
                are considered sensitive.

.* OPTION PROTECT
.optix PROTECT
PROTECT\\\\\\\\\Logs all SET PROTECT commands for the specified profile.

.* OPTION FAILURES
.optix FAILURES
FAILURES\\\\\\\\Logs all access failures to any data set protected by the
                specified profile.  This is the default for all "sensitive"
                accounts.

.* OPTION WRITE
.optix WRITE
WRITE\\\\\\\\\\\Logs all successful and unsuccessful attempts to write
                (including rename and scratch) a data set protected by the
                specified profile.  Also logs unsuccessful read attempts.

.* OPTION ALL
.optix ALL
ALL\\\\\\\\\\\\ Logs all successful and unsuccessful attempts to read or
                write data sets protected by the profile.

.* OPTION NOTIFY
.optix NOTIFY
NOTIFY [gg.uuu]\Specifies the account which will receive each day the log
                records generated for the previous day.  The log records are
                sent via electronic mail.  If this option is not specified,
                the account issuing the SET PROTECT command is the default.

.* OPTION NOPROMPT
.optix NOPROMPT
NOPROMPT\\\\\\\\Suppresses all interactive prompts from this command. For
                example, when changing the DEFAULT profile, without this
                option, a warning message appears and asks if it is o.k. to
                continue.

.* OPTION LIST
.optix LIST
LIST\\\\\\\\\\\\Causes the access rules and the associated data sets protected
                by the specified profile name to be displayed in the command
                response, as if a SHOW PROTECT WITH DSN command had been
                issued.  The default is that no display of access status is
                given.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\When specified with the LIST option, allows you to insert the
                system response to the SET PROTECT command into your active
                file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for a description of these
                options.
