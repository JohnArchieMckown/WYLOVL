.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW DSNAMES command displays a list of the names of the data sets stored
on the system, according to the criteria specified in the command.

.* SELECT 'SHOW DSNAMES Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR,PUBLIC
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to display the data sets belonging to
                an account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME,TEMPORARY
.optix ON
.optix TEMPORARY
{ON\volume}|TEMPORARY
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ON volume indicates a particular volume that is to be searched
                for the data set names.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description
                of volume.)\ TEMPORARY indicates that the system catalog is to
                be searched for any of your data sets that are stored on
                temporary volumes.  (You are not charged for data sets saved on
                temporary volumes; however, each morning all data sets on
                those volumes are scratched.)\ If the ON volume option or
                TEMPORARY option is not specified, WYLBUR searches the system
                catalog, which includes all of your data sets.

.* OPTION ONLY
.optix ONLY
ONLY\dsname\\\\\displays only the data set with the specified name.  This is
                faster than the LIKE option because it does not scan the catalog
                for similar names.

.* OPTION LIKE
.optix LIKE
LIKE\{string|*}\string displays only the data set names that begin with the
                specified string.  If * is specified instead, the current
                prefix setting is used.  (Type HELP SET PREFIX for a
                description of SET PREFIX.)\ string may consist of an
                alphabetic character, a string of characters, or a data set
                name.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\If used with the FROM and THROUGH options, the LIKE option
                defines a pattern data set name.  For example:

                   SHOW DSNAME LIKE XYZ FROM F THROUGH G

                on account NR.CAR would display all data sets of the form:
                WYL.NR.CAR.XYZFxxxx through WYL.NR.CAR.XYZGxxxx

.* OPTION FROM,EXCLUDE
.optix FROM
.optix EXCLUDE
{FROM|EXCLUDE}\{string1|*}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\FROM string1 specifies that the first data set name, the lower
                limit, is to start the display list.  If FROM * is specified
                instead, the current prefix is used.  (Type HELP SET PREFIX
                for a description of SET PREFIX.)\ If the FROM option is
                omitted, the displayed list starts with the first data name
                found.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\EXCLUDE string1 specifies that the data set name is to
                excluded from the display list.  If EXCLUDE * is specified
                instead, the current prefix is used.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\string1 may consist of an alphabetic character, a string of
                characters, or a data set name.

.* OPTION TO,THROUGH,THRU
.optix TO
.optix THROUGH
{TO|THROUGH}\{string2|*}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\TO string2 specifies that the last data set name (excluding
                the specified data set name), the upper limit, is to end the
                display list.  If TO * is specified instead, the current
                prefix is used.  (Type HELP SET PREFIX for a description of
                SET PREFIX.)\ If the TO option is omitted, the displayed list
                ends with the last data set name found.  string2 may consist
                of an alphabetic character, a string of characters, or a data
                set name.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\THROUGH functions similiar to the TO option with the exception
                that it includes the data set name specified.

.* OPTION TRACKS
.optix TRACKS
TRACKS\\\\\\\\\\specifies that WYLBUR list the amount of space occupied by
                each disk file (in tracks).  In addition, the number of
                extents (contiguous pieces of space) is given if it is not 1.

.* OPTION TYPE
.optix TYPE
TYPE\\\\\\\\\\\\requests that the format of the file be displayed.
                Specifically, the DCB parameters DSORG, RECFM, LRECL and
                BLKSIZE (and the KEYLENGTH if available) are given.  If the
                values are not defined, asterisks may appear instead.

.* OPTION DATED
.optix DATED
DATED\\\\\\\\\\\causes WYLBUR to list the date the data set was created and
                the date it was last accessed.

.* OPTION ALL
.optix ALL
ALL\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that the TRACKS, TYPE, and DATED information be
                given for each data set.

.* OPTION INTERNAL
.optix INTERNAL
INTERNAL\\\\\\\\causes the fields to be displayed in a fixed format.  This is
                helpful when the response is being directed to the active file
                (i.e., DUMP DSNAME INTERNAL) for further processing.  The
                format is:

\....v....1....v....2....v....3....v....4....v....5....v....6....

.us |\\\\|Columns|\\\\\|Description

      1/6       Volume name, or "MIGRAT" for a migrated data set
      8/51      Fully qualified data set name
     53/57      Number of tracks used
     58/58      Status code or blank*
     59/63      Number of tracks allocated
     65/67      Number of extents
     69/71      Data set organization (DSORG)
     73/77      Record format (RECFM)
     79/83      Record length (LRECL)
     85/89      Block size (BLKSIZE)
     91/93      Key length (KEYLEN)
     95/102     Creation date
    104/111     Last access date
    113/113     Data set modified flag: Y=modified since last backup
    115/122     Device type code (8 hex digits)
    124/131     Device model name (e.g. "3390")
    135/142     Space used, Kbytes
    144/151     Space allocated, Kbytes
    153/160     Storage Class, blank if not system-managed dataset
    162/169     Management Class or blank
    171/178     Data Class or blank
    179/235     Reserved for future changes

*Status Code (column 54) is normally blank, but may be:

  A  for a migrated ("Archived") data set
  D  if the dataset is not on the cataloged volume (DSCB not found)
  M  if the cataloged volume is not Mounted
  X  for unusual disk errors

Codes other than A are not currently displayed, that is, data sets that would
have one of these codes are not listed.  This will change in a future
implementation.

Fields described as "reserved" and any columns not described above may change
without advance notice.  This includes blank columns otherwise used as
separators between items.  If you write EXEC files or other code that
processes this information, you should not rely on any such columns being
blank -- use substring functions or the COLUMNS option of READ STRING, or
other equivalent methods, to extract the fields you want.

Migrated data sets will show only the data set name, the pseudo-volume
"MIGRAT", the SMS information (storage, management, and data classes), and the
status code "A" (archived) with other fields blank.

.* OPTION SCRATCH
.optix SCRATCH
SCRATCH\\\\\\\\\allows you to scratch (erase) any sequential external file.
                After the data set name has been listed, WYLBUR prompts
                "Scratch (Yes/No)?".  A response of YES, Y, or OK causes the
                data set to be scratched.  Any other response is interpreted
                as a negative response and WYLBUR lists the next data set
                name.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the SHOW DSNAMES
                command into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for
                a description of these options.  This option cannot
                be specified with the SCRATCH option.
