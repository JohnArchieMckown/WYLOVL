.* OPTION LINE-NUMBER,LINE-NUMBER1,LINE-NUMBER2
.optix line-number
.optix line-number1
.optix line-number2
line-number1[/line-number2]
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the beginning and ending line numbers of the range
                to be renumbered.  If no line numbers are specified, the
                entire active file will be renumbered.  If you specify only
                one line number, all of the file is renumbered beginning with
                that number.  This option must be specified first if it is
                used.

.* OPTION START
.optix START
START=line-number
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the new first line number for the range to be
                renumbered.

.* OPTION BY
.optix BY
BY\increment\\\\specifies the line number increment to be used in determining
                successive line numbers.  If the increment is too large for
                the range specified, a smaller increment will be used.  This
                option cannot be used with TIMES or PLUS.

.* OPTION PLUS
.optix PLUS
PLUS\[-]n\\\\\\\specifies a positive or negative increment to be added to each
                line number in the range to be renumbered to form the new line
                numbers.  Although the increment may be any number, including
                symbolic line numbers, it will usually be a numeric value.

.* OPTION TIMES
.optix TIMES
TIMES\n\\\\\\\\\is the scale factor that multiplies each of the existing line
                numbers, in the range to be renumbered, to form the new line
                numbers.  Although the scale factor may be any number,
                including symbolic line numbers, it will usually be a numeric
                value.

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\suppresses the system response that WYLBUR issues when the
                NUMBER command is successful.
