OPEN [name [TITLE='text'] [TEMPORARY]]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The OPEN command opens a new, empty active file.  The existing active file is
put in the active file stack when the new active file is opened.  The name and
title options let you give the active file a name and a descriptive title.

To see your active file stack, type the command SHOW ACTIVES.  The CLOSE
command clears the contents of the current active file, closes it, and
restores the previous one.  To pick a different active file, type PICK
followed by the number you want.  HELP is available on all of these subjects.

.* OPTION NAME
.optix name
name\\\\\\\\\\\\a name to be associated with the active file.  The name
                appears in the top information bar in Page mode, and in the
                listing of active files when you type the SHOW ACTIVES
                command.  The name should be no more than eight characters and
                must begin with a letter.

.* OPTION TITLE
.optix TITLE
TITLE='text'\\\\a title for the active file, that is displayed in the top
                information line in Page mode.  The title must be enclosed in
                single or double quotation marks.

.* OPTION TEMPORARY
.optix TEMPORARY
TEMPORARY\\\\\\\to open a temporary active file.  Generally used by programs
                that need an active file but don't want it to linger in the
                user's session after it is no longer needed, a temporary
                active file does not show up when a SHOW ACTIVES ALL command
                is issued unless it is the currently selected active file.
                No auto-recovery is done for temporary active files either.
                To see what temporary active files are still around, use the
                SHOW ACTIVES TEMPORARY command.  TEMP is a commonly used
                abbreviation.
