.* DESCRIPTION
The XMONITOR command monitors the execution and performance of an EXEC file.
The monitor tracks how many times each command in an EXEC is executed and how
many CPU seconds are spent on each command.  Results are accurate to within
10%, and measurements are rounded to the nearest thousandth of a second.

The related command, SHOW XMONITOR, displays the monitoring information.  Type
HELP SHOW XMONITOR for more information.  The monitor information will not be
correct for non-Extended EXECs that execute other non-Extended EXECs.
