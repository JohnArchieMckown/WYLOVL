.chapter 'Summary of Commands'
This chapter provides an overview of WYLBUR by briefly describing
the function of each command.  (Part II contains a complete
description of each WYLBUR command.)\

The commands described in this chapter are divided into three major
functional areas:
.point set b
.point begin
Editing Commands.  These commands allow you to modify and manipulate
the contents of the active file.
.point
Control Commands.  These commands interface with the operating
system and the job entry system (JES) in performing system
functions.  They allow you to perform a variety of functions like
saving your active file, getting a list of your data set names, or
submitting a job to the central computer.
.point
Commands relating to EXEC files, the WYLBUR preprocessor, and the
use of the conditional IF command.  Some commands relating to EXEC
files (e.g.  LIST, PRINT) are included below in the Editing and
Control command summaries because they can also be used to affect
files other than EXEC files (the active file or an external data
set).
.point end
.section 'Editing Commands'
This section covers the Line mode editing commands.  See Part II,
the VIEW command, for a complete description of the Page mode
commands.  Many of the Line mode editing commands work in Page mode.
.in 18
.tr ^ ^

.oo 1 ALIGN

each line contains as many words as possible but no more than the

clears the get stack, a temporary stack of characters created with
the MODIFY character G (for GET).  This is part of a cutting and
pasting mechanism in the MODIFY command.

clears all words from the private spelling dictionary.  See
also SPELL and LEARN.

.oo 1 COLLECT
creates or adds one or more lines of text in the active file.

the result.

.oo 1 JUSTIFY
is identical to ALIGN except that it right- and left-justifies text
in the specified range by inserting blanks between words.

.oo 1 LEARN
adds a word to the private spelling dictionary.  See also SPELL.

.oo 1 LIST
lists all or part of the active file or the EXEC file at the
terminal.

specified range of lines in the active file.  See also CHANGE and
EDIT.

moves a specified range of lines from one part of the active file to
another, deleting the range from the original location.

.oo 1 NUMBER
renumbers all or part of the active file.

.oo 1 POINT
functions exactly as LIST except that POINT updates the pointer to
the current line.

.oo 1 REPLACE
allows replacement of the contents of the specified range of lines
in the active file.

executed IF command is false.  See also THEN.

.oo 1 EXECUTE
allows you to load and to execute a file of WYLBUR commands, to
branch within an EXEC file, or to restart execution within the EXEC
file.

.oo 1 IF
evaluates a relational expression and if the result is true,

See also THEN and ELSE.

.oo 1 PUTEND

RETURN.

is executed only when the relational value of the most recently
executed IF command is true.  See also ELSE and IF.  THEN does not
work in extended EXECs.***
