.* DESCRIPTION
The SET LPRINT command tells the system which kind of printer you are using
with the LPRINT command.  This lets you take advantage of any special support
developed for the printer.

The LaserJet and LaserWriter printers have many special supported features,
including different character sets and landscape printing.  For the other
printer types, you can use the elite or condensed character sets by specifying
CU12 or CU15.  Other ASCII printers can be used with the LPRINT command but
have no special features.

Type HELP LPRINT for information on the LPRINT command, and HELP JPRINT for
information on the closely related JPRINT command.

SET LPRINT is a session setting, not a permanent setting, and does not carry
over from session to session.

Though it is usually obvious which printer type you should specify, in the case
of Macintosh printers, you should follow this chart:

.* SELECT 'SET LPRINT Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION NOREVERSE
.optix NOREVERSE
NOREVERSE\\\\\\\use this option if you have a collating stacker on a LaserJet
                printer, so that the pages end up in the right order.
                (Normally, the printer program reverses output.)

.* OPTION FONT
.optix FONT
FONT=font\\\\\\\specifies special font processing options for the LaserJet
                printer only.  The allowed values are PC, if you have the PC
                cartridge, or USASCII, to specify that fixed-pitch fonts
                should be in effect, using the HP 'USASCII' symbol set.  This
                provides access to the fixed-pitch fonts in several of the
                LaserJet font cartridges, such as the "Z" cartridge.
