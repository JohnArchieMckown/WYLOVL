TO {port-id|user-id@bitnet-node} [message]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The TO command allows you to send a one-line message to another currently
logged-on user.  You may specify a user code (uuu) instead of the port-id; if
it is not unique, WYLBUR lists the users that match and prompts for a specific
user.  Since the TO command implies that you want an immediate response, you
should avoid using it except when necessary.  If you do not want to be
interrupted by a message sent by a TO command, issue the command SET TERMINAL
NOCOMM.  (Type HELP SET TERMINAL NOCOMM for a description of this command.)\

You can also use the TO command to send a message to another logged-on BITNET
user.  To do this, include the user's user-id and host-id on the TO message.
The message may not exceed 80 characters.

These messages are not queued if an intermediate host is down, and you are not
generally notified if the message can't be delivered.  For these reasons, it
is best to start the conversation with a message like:

        Command> to smith@slacvm are you there?
