ERRORCMD [ERRID=error-id] [ERRMSG='error message']
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The ERRORCMD command can be used to invoke an error condition in WYLBUR.  It
is generally used in exec files, particularly extended execs.  The syntax
matches the error controls available for "XRETURN ERROR".  This command sets
the ERROR, ERRID, ERRMSG and ERRINFO system variables.  It may be abbreviated
to ERRCMD.

.* SELECT 'ERRORCMD Statement Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION ERRID
.optix ERRID
ERRID=error-id\\sets the system variable ERRID to the value given.  This can
                be a character string from 1 to 8 characters long; it cannot
                begin with a numeral, nor can it include blanks.  If this
                option is omitted, the value of ERRID is set to 'ERROR'.

.* OPTION ERRMSG
.optix ERRMSG
ERRMSG='error message'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\sets the system variable ERRMSG to the value given.  This is
                the message WYLBUR displays when the error occurs.  It can be
                quite long, limited by the maximum command length of 235
                characters; a practical limit would be about 180 characters,
                but commonly, since the message is usually displayed, it is
                much shorter.  If the value contains blanks, it must be placed
                in quotes.  If this option is omitted, the value of ERRMSG is
                'Error set by ERRORCMD'.
