PCALL procname [(variable-list)]

.* DESCRIPTION
(** Extended EXECs only **)
The PCALL statement calls a procedure within the current Extended EXEC file.
Procedures must begin with the PROC statement, and the procname used to PCALL
the procedure must be the same name as on the PROC statement.  (Type HELP PROC
for more information.)

If you pass a list of variables to the procedure, there must be a list of the
same number of variables on the PROC statement.  Variables will map onto each
other in the order in which they are listed.

Variables values can be returned from the procedure with the RETURN statement;
type HELP RETURN for more information.
