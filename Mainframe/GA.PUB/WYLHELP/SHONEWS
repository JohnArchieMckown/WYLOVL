.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW NEWS command allows you to read articles from the public NEWS data
set.  (NEWS contains important items about changes or additions to the Forsythe
computer and the Stanford Data Center.) Once you issue the SHOW NEWS command,
the title of each item that has not already been read by your account will be
displayed, along with a "Read?" prompt.  You can choose to either read the item
or go on to the next title.  The items will be listed in reverse chronological
order.

You may receive NEWS automatically when you logon, if SET AUTO NEWS is in
effect for your account.  A description of the NEWS facility is available
online by typing HELP NEWS.
