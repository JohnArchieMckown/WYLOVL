The term volume refers to a disk drive used to store both WYLBUR and other
system data sets.  You only need to specify a volume when you are creating a
new data set on a private volume.  When referring to existing data sets, the
system catalog is used to find the volume automatically.  When creating a new
data set, the system will normally choose a suitable volume for you.

Volumes controlled by the System-Managed Storage (SMS) subsystem are not
displayed by the SHOW VOLUMES command, and requests to save on a particular
SMS volume are treated as generalized requests to use system-managed storage.
SMS assigns data sets to "storage pools" based on size and other
characteristics of the data set; assignment to a particular volume within a
storage pool is based on available free space.  Data sets in the general
storage pool may be moved from one volume to another as part of routine disk
maintenance; this will not affect your use of the data set, because the system
catalog is always updated to show the correct volume.

You may be able to use a different host computer as the "volume" if you have
an account on the computer.  For example, a Forsythe command such as SAVE
MYFILE ON LINDY would let you save a data set called MYFILE on the Lindy
computer, just as if you were logged on to it.  (WYLBUR will ask you for an
account and password for the other computer.)
