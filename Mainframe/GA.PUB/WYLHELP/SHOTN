.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW TELNET (or SHOW TN) command displays the list of open Telnet sessions
opened with the TELNET command, with a "=>" indicating the currently selected
Telnet session.  For example,

 Command> show telnet
 Conn Host
    1 forsythetn
 => 2 lindy

In the example, two Telnet sessions are open, with the second one, to the host
computer Lindy, being the current one.  If you issued the TELNET command by
itself, the session on Lindy would be resumed.  You could resume the session
to ForsytheTN by issuing the command "TELNET 1".
