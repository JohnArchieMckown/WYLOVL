Arrays

You can use arrays of variables in the extended WYLBUR EXEC file support.
Like all variables, arrays can be of three types:  numbers, strings, or
boolean (true/false).

You must always declare any array with the DECLARE command before referencing
the array.  To declare an array, specify the variable type, the array name,
and the array's maximum dimension (in square brackets).

     DECLARE  NUMBER   name[num]
     DECLARE  STRING   name[num]
     DECLARE  BOOLEAN  name[num]

To assign a value to a variable in the array, use the array name followed by
the variable's location, in square brackets.  For example,

     FOO[17] = 20

To display the value of a single element of an array, use the SHOW VALUE
command (SV):

     SV FOO[17]
     20

To display the entire contents of an array, type the SHOW ARRAY command:

     SHOW ARRAY FOO

The LIKE, FROM, and TO options help you specify which parts of the array to
display.  Type HELP SHOW ARRAY for more details.
