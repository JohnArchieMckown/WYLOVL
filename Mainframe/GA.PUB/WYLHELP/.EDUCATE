ITS offers introductory and advanced lecture/demonstration classes
in WYLBUR each quarter.  The Information Desk in Forsythe Hall can
give you details on all the ITS education opportunities.

If you have questions about WYLBUR or any other aspect of computing
at ITS, contact the Consulting Office in Forsythe Hall.  It is
helpful for the consultants if you bring a printed record of your
terminal session with you.  Consultants are normally available
during midmorning and midafternoon hours, Monday through Friday,
except on University holidays.  Check the online data set
DOC#SCHEDULE PUBLIC for the current schedule.  The Information Desk
staff, available most evenings and weekends (as well as during
regular work hours, M-F), can often assist you when Consulting is
closed.
