Overview of the VISTA Subsystem
-------------------------------

The purpose of the VISTA subsystem is to allow a WYLBUR user to conveniently
"Logon" to standard IBM applications such as TSO and CICS.  Any terminal which
is able to use the WYLBUR VIEW command or PRISM may use the VLOGON command.
This is currently an experimental facility, and is subject to change without
notice.

The VISTA subsystem implements the commands:

         VLOGON
         VGO
         VATTN
         VLOGOFF

VISTA simulates an IBM 3278/79 Model 2 terminal.  3270 "Extended Attributes"
and 7-colors are simulated.  Multiple character set selection is supported,
but not the ability to load a character set.

There is a fixed list of terminal IDs which may be used by this processor.
When you execute a VLOGON command, one of these IDs will be assigned to your
session.

VISTA maintains the image of a 3270 terminal screen.  It interacts with the
IBM application as if it were a 3270 terminal.

By using the BREAK key, you may temporarily suspend your VISTA session, and
return to your WYLBUR session.  VISTA continues to maintain the 3270 screen.
You may return to your session, by typing VGO at a WYLBUR command prompt.

This processor is not meant to be a perfect simulation of a 3270 terminal.  It
is the byproduct of the terminal facilities of WYLBUR.  The same keyboard
sequences for PF keys, character insert and character delete are used as with
other WYLBUR commands.

.* prompt 'Do you want the specific key sequences'

The following keyboard sequences are used for specific 3270 actions:

   RETURN         Enter    <-- There is no newline function.

   ESC I          Insert (toggle)

   TAB            TAB
   ESC TAB        BACKTAB

   ESC C          Clear
   ESC A          Attn
   ESC S          PA1      <--  these keys are mnemonic by
   ESC D          PA2      <--  position on the keyboard, rather
   ESC F          PA3      <--  than by the letter of the key.

   ESC 1          PF1
   ...            ...
   ESC 9          PF9
   ESC =10        PF10
   ...            ...
   ESC =39        PF39

.* prompt 'Do you want the technical notes'
<.b+>Technical Notes:<.b->
SSCP functions are those provided by the "System Services Control Point".  On
a real 3270 terminal they are accessed by using the "SysRq" key, and indicated
by a stick-man on the status line.  On this simulator the SSCP functions are
provided by the commands mentioned above.

When logging on to TSO, if you do not receive the first TSO prompt within a
minute, press the RETURN key.

The graphics pass-through feature is simulated, in order to display SAS
graphic output.
