.* DESCRIPTION
The SYSA/SYSB/SYSC commands let you execute any command on the other machine
if you have a valid account on that machine.  For example, from SYSA:

     Command> sysc show ipl

If you have a number of commands to execute, you can type just the SYSx
command and then collect the commands to send:

     Command> sysc
     Enter commands for SYSC (press BREAK when done)...
         1.\\\> show ipl
         2.\\\> show net
         3.\\\> show info
         4.\\\> ***         <--- press BREAK or ATTN
     <... results from commands displayed here ...>

The SYSA/SYSB/SYSC commands submit a BATWYL job on the other machine and then
display the results.
