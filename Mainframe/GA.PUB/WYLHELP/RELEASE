.* DESCRIPTION
The RELEASE command allows you to release a job or a job's output from HOLD
status (either execution hold or output hold).  A job must be awaiting output
processing if you wish to RELEASE particular portions of the output.

The HOLD command allows you to stop the processing of a job.  Type HELP HOLD
for a description of this command.

.optix jobid
jobid\\\\\\\\\\\identifies the job(s) to be released.  This option is required
                and must be specified first.  Type HELP JOBID for a
                description of the various forms of jobid.

.* OPTION MULTIPLE
.optix MULTIPLE
MULTIPLE\\\\\\\\causes the command to be processed if the jobid matches more
                than one jobname in the system.  When several jobs are
                explicitly referred to by number, the MULTIPLE option is not
                necessary.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to release a job or jobs belonging to an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.  If this option is
                specified, you will be prompted for the password of the

                soon as a job has begun execution, other options may be used.

                output-options.
