JOIN range [SEPARATOR='string'|NOSEPARATOR] [NOTRIM] [NODELETE]

.* DESCRIPTION
The JOIN command joins two or more lines and replaces the first line specified
with the result.  The second and subsequent lines are deleted, unless you
specify the NODELETE option.  One blank space separates the lines once they
are joined, unless you specify the SEPARATOR option.  Remember that no line in
WYLBUR may exceed 235 characters.

                lines.

.optix list-options
list-options\\\\NOLIST is the default for this command.  If you specify LIST,
                the joined lines are listed.  (Type HELP LIST-OPTIONS for a
                description of the list-options.)\

.* OPTION LENGTH-OPTIONS,LENGTH,NOLENGTH
.optix length-options
length-options\\provide an override of the global length parameter
                (established with the SET LENGTH command).  If you specify
                NOLENGTH, the warning message about excess length will not be
                issued (unless the line is over 235 characters).  Type
                HELP LENGTH-OPTIONS for a description of the length-options.

.* OPTION VERIFY
.optix VERIFY
VERIFY\\\\\\\\\\causes WYLBUR to list each line before deleting it and to
                issue a permission prompt "Join (Yes/No/Modify/Edit)?".  You
                can make the following responses:

                   YES, Y, OK  -- join the line
                   NO, N       -- don't join the line
                   MODIFY, M   -- switch into MODIFY after joining the lines
                   EDIT, E     -- switch into EDIT after joining the lines

                If you press the BREAK key, WYLBUR aborts the command.
