.* DESCRIPTION
The SET NOMAIL command prohibits other users from sending you mail.  NOMAIL is
the default when an account is first opened and is permanent until you change
it.

The SET MAIL command allows you to receive mail from other users.  Your mail
will be saved under your account in a data set called MAIL (your mailbox).
Once you have a mailbox, you can use the SET MAIL command to reverse any SET
NOMAIL commands you issue, allowing users to send you mail again.  Type HELP
SET MAIL for description of SET MAIL.
