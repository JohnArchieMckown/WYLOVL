The PICK command opens an active file in the active file stack and puts the
current active file, if any, into the stack.  PICK followed by the number of

active file in the stack, while PICK NEXT picks the next.

You can use the PICK command to restore an active file that has been cleared.
Type the command SHOW ACTIVES ALL to see a list of current and cleared active
files.  Your last cleared active file is always saved.  Then type the command
PICK followed by the number of the cleared active file.
