RESTORE [KEEP|CLEAR\[NOWARN]]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The RESTORE command moves the current EXEC file from the EXEC file space to
the active file for editing.  The current active file must be empty before you
issue a RESTORE command, unless you include the CLEAR option.  WYLBUR clears
the EXEC file space when it executes a RESTORE command.

The RESTORE command does not work with extended EXECs.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR
.optix KEEP
KEEP\\\\\\\\\\\\puts the current active file into the active file stack
                without clearing its contents before copying the specified
                data set.  You can then get this previous active file using
                the PICK command followed by the active file number.
                Responding KEEP to the "OK\to\Clear (Yes/No/Keep)?" prompt
                does the same thing.

.* OPTION CLEAR,CLR
.optix CLEAR
CLEAR\\\\\\\\\\\clears the active file before the restore.  If this option is
                not specified, and there is an active file, WYLBUR prompts
                "OK\to\Clear (Yes/No/Keep)?".

.* OPTION NOWARN
.optix NOWARN
NOWARN\\\\\\\\\\when specified with the CLEAR option, overrides WARN mode, the
                logon default.  (Type HELP SET MODES WARN NOWARN for a
                description of the WARN and NOWARN modes.)\
