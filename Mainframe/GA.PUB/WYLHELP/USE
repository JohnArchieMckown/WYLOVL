.* DESCRIPTION
The USE command copies a data set saved on a disk volume into the active file.
The active file must be cleared or a new one opened.  To combine the data set
with the current active file, use the COPY...FROM command.  The USE command
also sets the PREFIX to the specified dsname.  (Type HELP SET PREFIX for a
description of PREFIX.)\

.* SELECT 'USE Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION DSNAME
.optix dsname
dsname\\\\\\\\\\is the name of the data set to be copied into the active file.
                This option is required and must be specified first.  If you
                are uploading a file with Samson, add the disk drive
                designation before the file name:  A:filename.  Type HELP
                DSNAME for full information on this option.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR,PUBLIC
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to use a data set belonging to an account
                other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of this
                option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a
                description of the account-options.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME
.optix VOLUME
VOLUME\volume\\\indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ If
                this option is not specified, WYLBUR searches the system
                catalog for the data set name and its volume location.
.optix ON
ON\hostname\\\\\indicates the name of the computer system ("host") on which
                the file is stored.  ON may also be used to specify a volume
                instead of the VOLUME option, but this usage is ambiguous.


.* OPTION FORMAT-OPTIONS,EDIT,CARD,PRINT,RECFM,LRECL,BLKSIZE,NUMBERED,INTEGER,UNNUMBERED,SEQFLD
.optix format-options
format-options\\allow you to specify the record length and the treatment of
                WYLBUR line numbers in the data set to be used.  (Type HELP
                FORMAT-OPTIONS for a description of these options.)\

.* OPTION SKIP
.optix SKIP
SKIP=n\\\\\\\\\\causes the first n lines of the data set to be skipped (not be
                put in the active file).

.* OPTION COUNT
.optix COUNT
COUNT=n\\\\\\\\\causes only n lines (starting at the beginning of the file) to
                be copied into the active file.

.* OPTION WRAP
.optix WRAP
WRAP=n\\\\\\\\\\when using Samson, the WRAP option inserts hard carriage
                returns so that the lines are approximately the specified
                length (n).  The carriage returns are inserted at the blank
                nearest column n.  This is helpful for uploading files from
                word processing programs to WYLBUR.

.* OPTION SPLIT=n
.optix SPLIT=n
SPLIT=n\\\\\\\\\when uploading a file with Samson, splits long lines at the
                specified length.  This only works with Samson version 3.0 or
                higher.

.* OPTION TABS
.optix TABS
TABS\\\\\\\\\\\\when uploading from Samson, brings tab characters into the
                dataset as hex '05' characters.  The default is to change them
                into blanks, with WYLBUR trying to align fields into
                8-characters-long fields.  TABS gives you flexibility to set
                the field lengths yourself later, e.g., using CHANGE commands.

.* OPTION TRANSPARENT,DTRANSPARENT
.optix TRANSPARENT
.optix DTRANSPARENT
TRANSPARENT|DTRANSPARENT
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\TRANSPARENT specifies that the file is a non-text file being
                uploaded with the Samson program.  The TRANSPARENT option lets
                you transfer non-text files between microcomputers running
                Samson via the Data Center.  DTRANSPARENT specifies that the
                file is a non-text file being uploaded with the MacSamson
                program to transfer to an IBM PC.  (In other situations, use
                the TRANSPARENT option.)

.* OPTION KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR
.optix KEEP
KEEP\\\\\\\\\\\\puts the current active file into the active file stack
                without clearing its contents before copying the specified
                data set.  You can then get this previous active file using
                the PICK command followed by the active file number.
                Responding KEEP to the "OK\to\Clear (Yes/No/Keep)?" prompt
                does the same thing.  If your current active file is empty,
                then the new file being used is put into the current active
                file; KEEP does not stack an empty active file.  Specifying
                KEEP is equivalent to issuing an OPEN command before the USE.

.* OPTION UNFORMATTED,TEXTONLY
.optix UNFORMATTED
.optix TEXTONLY
UNFORMATTED|TEXTONLY
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\If the file is being uploaded from a microcomputer and contains
                non-alphanumeric characters besides those found on a computer
                keyboard (such as a copyright symbol, or an N with a tilde),
                then WYLBUR will normally convert such characters into
                character format-strings (which look like "<::copyright>" or
                "<::N~>", for instance).  For most circumstances, this is good;
                if you download the file back to the microcomputer, WYLBUR will
                reconvert them to the original non-alphanumeric characters.
                UNFORMATTED tells WYLBUR to leave the character as an EBCDIC
                character without converting it to a format-string (thus, it
                remains a single character).  TEXTONLY tells WYLBUR to convert
                each character to its best approximation of the character,
                instead of a format-string.  So, for the example characters
                mentioned above, with TEXTONLY you'd get "(c)" and "N".
                (Try HELP CHARACTER FORMAT-STRINGS for more information).

.* OPTION CLEAR,CLR
.optix CLEAR
CLEAR\\\\\\\\\\\clears the current active file (if any) and opens a new one
                before copying specified data set.  If the active file is not
                empty and CLEAR is not specified, WYLBUR will prompt for
                permission to clear the active file.

.* OPTION NOWARN
.optix NOWARN
NOWARN\\\\\\\\\\when specified with the CLEAR option, overrides WARN mode, the
                logon default.  (Type HELP SET MODES WARN NOWARN for a
                description of the WARN and NOWARN modes.)\

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that all system responses be suppressed if the
                command is unsuccessful.
