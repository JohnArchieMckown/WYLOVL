.* DESCRIPTION
The DEFINE command lets you define your own commands or redefine existing
system commands.  These user-defined commands are valid for the duration of
your terminal session.  (You can include them in your Logon EXEC file.)\
Before WYLBUR executes the command it substitutes the replacement text
(usually a system command) for your user-defined command.  If automatic
command retry is in effect, WYLBUR displays the substituted command for you to
modify.  (Type HELP SET MODES RETRY for a description of RETRY mode.)\

The following examples illustrate the DEFINE command:

     DEFINE BYE AS 'LOGOFF CLEAR'
     DEFINE SPI AS 'CALL SPIRES(W)'
     DEFINE MS AS MODIFY APPEND ' SINGLE NOLIST'

The SHOW DEFINED command displays all your user-defined commands, UNDEFINE can
be used to remove a specific user-defined command, and CLEAR DEFINED will
undefine all your user-defined commands.

If you are defining a SPIRES command, you must have set WYLBUR when
you called SPIRES (as in the example above).

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION USER-COMMAND
.optix user-command
user-command\\\\specifies the command name to be defined.  If it is longer
                than eight characters, only the first eight characters are
                saved and only the first eight characters need be used to
                reference the command.

.* OPTION AS
.optix AS
AS\'replacement\text'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies text (usually a system command) that is to replace
                the "user-command" (the user-defined command).  You must
                enclose the replacement text in quotation marks or
                apostrophes, if it is more than one word (including required
                blanks).

.* OPTION APPEND
.optix APPEND
APPEND\'append\text'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies text that is to be appended to the end of the
                command after any user-supplied values.  For example, if you
                issue the following command:

                   DEFINE DOC AS 'USE DOC#' APPEND ' PUBLIC'

                You can then issue the command DOC WYLBUR and WYLBUR changes
                it to USE DOC#WYLBUR PUBLIC.  You must enclose the append text
                in quotation marks or apostrophes, if it is more than one word
                (including required blanks).

.* OPTION ABBREVIATE
.optix ABBREVIATE
ABBREVIATE\\\\\\specifies that the "user-command" (the user-defined command)
                can be abbreviated to the first three or more characters.

.* OPTION REPLACE
.optix REPLACE
REPLACE\\\\\\\\\specifies that the command definition can replace a previously
                defined user command.  If omitted, you will be prompted with:

                   <user-command> is already defined.
                   REDEFINE (Yes/No)?

.* OPTION SYSTEM
.optix SYSTEM
SYSTEM\\\\\\\\\\suppresses the "<user-command> redefines the system <command>
                command." message when you define a command that replaces a
                system command.
