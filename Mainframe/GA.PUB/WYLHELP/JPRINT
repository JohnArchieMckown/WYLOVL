.* DESCRIPTION

It also works if you are using a DEC VT100-compatible terminal with an ASCII

.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to print a job or jobs belonging to an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.  If this option is

                account before the command is executed.

.* OPTION MSG,NOMSG
.optix MSG
.optix NOMSG
MSG|NOMSG\\\\\\\indicates whether or not both the JES2 job log and JCL data
                sets are to be printed.  MSG is equivalent to LOG JCL and
                NOMSG to NOLOG NOJCL.

.* OPTION LOG,NOLOG
.optix LOG
.optix NOLOG
LOG|NOLOG\\\\\\\indicates whether or not the JES2 job log is to be printed.
