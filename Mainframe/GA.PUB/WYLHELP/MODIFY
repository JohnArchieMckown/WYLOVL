.* DESCRIPTION
The MODIFY command allows you to make insertions, replacements, and deletions
to the contents of each line in a specified range of the active file.  WYLBUR
prompts you for alterations until the range is exhausted.  For each line
specified the following process is carried out.

WYLBUR lists the unmodified line and then prompts you with "Mods\\>\" so you
can make changes to the line using the modify characters described below.  You
signal the end of your alterations by pressing the RETURN key.  WYLBUR types
the altered line for inspection, unless NOLIST is specified, and prompts for
more alterations to the line unless SINGLE is specified.

By pressing the RETURN key in answer to the Mods prompt, you can move to the
next line.  To stop the modification process, press the BREAK key and the line
will remain unchanged.  You can also type a question mark (?) in response to
the Mods prompt to get a list of some of the characters available for response
to the prompt.

.us MODIFY Characters

.ix 'MODIFY Characters' W
.ix W 'as MODIFY Character'
To modify a line, type in one of the following characters (in upper- or
lowercase) in response to the Mods prompt.  The W character makes the
following modify character affect and entire word.  Note that you use the [n]
specified with some of the characters to specify the length of the
modification, thus allowing multiple modifications.  Used in conjunction with
the W character, it specifies the number of words to be affected.

.ix 'MODIFY Characters' B
.ix B 'as MODIFY Character'
[n][W]B\\\To blank out individual characters in a line, type a B under each
          position to be replaced with a blank.  Only those positions are
          blanked; no shifting of the line takes place.  After typing a B, you
          can make additional alterations to the line before pressing the
          RETURN key.

.ix 'MODIFY Characters' C
.ix C 'as MODIFY Character'
[n][W]C\\\Type the letter C to invert the case of the text (i.e., uppercase
          becomes lowercase and lowercase becomes uppercase).  Case change is
          ignored if the character is non-alphabetic.

.ix 'MODIFY Characters' D
.ix D 'as MODIFY Character'
[n][W]D\\\To delete a string of characters from the line type a D under the
          first character to be removed.  You can terminate the deletion range
          by inserting or replacing as described above or by pressing the
          RETURN key.  If the deletion range is terminated by pressing the
          RETURN key, all characters from the first D up to the RETURN are
          deleted.  A deleted character is not replaced by a blank; blanks are
          treated as a continuation of the deletion range and the remaining
          text is shifted to the left by the number of spaces deleted.

.ix 'MODIFY Characters' E
.ix E 'as MODIFY Character'
[n][W]E\\\Type the letter E to switch to EDIT mode for altering the rest of
          the line.

.ix 'MODIFY Characters' G
.ix 'Modify Characters' G . 'see also SHOW GETSTACK Command'
.ix G 'as MODIFY Character'
[n][W]G\\\Type the letter G (for GET) immediately below a character to be
          saved in a temporary space (the get stack) for placement with the P
          (PUT) character.  The characters selected with the G will be deleted
          from the line (unless you press BREAK to the next Mods prompt, in
          which case the characters are saved in the get stack and remain in
          the line.  G and P work in two passes of the line, so the P may
          precede the G.  The W indicates that the entire word, beginning at
          the character above the cursor, is to be deleted and put in the get
          stack for later placement.

.ix 'MODIFY Characters' I
.ix I 'as MODIFY Character'
[n][W]I\\\Type the letter I (for INSERT) immediately below the character in
          the line in front of which characters are to be inserted.  Follow
          the letter I with the string of characters you want to insert.
          Terminate the string of characters to be inserted by pressing the
          RETURN key.

.ix 'MODIFY Characters' L
.ix L 'as MODIFY Character'
L\\\\\\\\\Type an L and press the RETURN key to list the line being modified
          as it currently stands.

.ix 'MODIFY Characters' N
.* 09/17/86 18:32 GG.LSO
.* The use of &SYSBS.&SYSRB is used in the following index entry in order to
.* get the 'N' (uppercase n) entry as a separate entry from 'n' (lowercase N).
.ix 'N&SYSBS.&SYSRB' 'as MODIFY Character'
N\\\\\\\\\Type an N before any other alteration character to suspend the
          printing of the altered line.  You can type an L to override a
          NOLIST option so that the altered line is listed.  Both LIST and
          NOLIST are options of the MODIFY command.  (See the description of
          list-options below for an explanation.)\

.ix 'Modify Characters' P
.ix 'Modify Characters' P . 'see also SHOW GETSTACK Command'
.ix P 'as MODIFY Character'
[n][W]P\\\Type the letter P (put) to insert characters saved with the G option
          at that point.  The W (word) option inserts an entire word from the
          get stack (the temporary storage for text saved with the G option).
          See the G option for more information.  See also SHOW GETSTACK.

.ix 'MODIFY Characters' R
.ix R 'as MODIFY Character'
[n][W]R\\\Type the character R (for REPLACE) immediately below the first
          character to be replaced in the line and type the string of
          replacement characters immediately following the R.  As many
          characters are replaced as there are characters in the replacement
          string.  Terminate the string of characters to be replaced by
          pressing the RETURN key.

.ix 'MODIFY Characters' S
.ix S 'as MODIFY Character'
S\\\\\\\\\Type the letter S to split a line into one or more lines.  The new
          line(s) go after the original line (WYLBUR selects an appropriate
          delta).  The lines are listed and you are then prompted for
          modifications to the line created after the last S.  A reply of
          pressing the BREAK key (only) to the Mods prompt will abort the
          previous split.  If you modify the new line, the split is confirmed
          and the active file is changed at that time.

.ix 'MODIFY Characters' T
.ix T 'as MODIFY Character'
cT\\\\\\\\Type a column number (c) and the letter T to position the cursor so
          that it is under is under column c.  For example, if you type the
          sequence 72TIX the cursor is positioned at column 72 and an X is
          inserted.  If c is an asterisk (*), the cursor will be positioned at
          the end of the line.

.ix 'MODIFY Characters' X
.ix X 'as MODIFY Character'
[n][W]X\\\Typing the letter X instead of the letter D allows you to delete
          multiple pieces of a line of text with one modification.  Blanks are
          not treated as a continuation of the deletion range.

.ix '(BREAK)'
.ix 'BREAK key'
.ix key BREAK
.cs 2 on
BREAK Key
---------
.cs 2 off
.us BREAK Key

The use of the BREAK key, alone or in combination with special characters is
identical to its use in the EDIT command.  Type HELP EDIT to get a description
of the use of the BREAK key with both the MODIFY and the EDIT commands.

.ix 'MODIFY Characters' 'Length Specification'
.cs 2 on
Length Specification
--------------------
.cs 2 off
.us Length Specification

If you want to modify an optional number of characters (between 1 and 235),
you can include a length specification with some modify characters.  The
modify characters that include a length specification are:  INSERT, REPLACE,
DELETE, EXPEL, BLANK, and CASE.  If you use an asterisk (*) as the length
specification, WYLBUR uses the number of characters that remain in the line as
the length.  For example:

   10B\\\\means blank the next ten characters beginning with the character
          underneath which you have typed the 1.

   *C\\\\\means change the case of all the characters (starting at the
          character above the "*") that remain in the line.

   2I//\\\means insert two slashes (//) before the character underneath which
          you have typed the 2.  Other modifications can follow this sequence;
          however, this would not be the case if only an I followed by two
          slashes had been typed.

   *D\\\\\means delete to the end of the line.

Length specifications can be positive (*+n) or negative (*-n).  For example,
*-1B will blank out the rest of the line except for the last character.

.* SELECT 'MODIFY Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\is the range of lines to be changed.  If specified, it must be
                the first option.  If this option is not specified, the entire
                file is assumed.  Type HELP RANGE for a description of range.

.* OPTION COLUMNS,COLS
.optix COLUMNS
COLUMNS=m[/n]\\\restricts the modifications to the columns specified.  When n
                is specified, modifications take place from column m to the
                end of the line.  m/n gives a specific number of columns to be
                modified.  When text is deleted, blanks are inserted at the
                ending column and any text past the last column specified will
                be lost (a message to that effect will be displayed at your
                terminal).

.* OPTION SINGLE,S
.optix SINGLE
SINGLE\\\\\\\\\\causes WYLBUR to prompt for alteration of a line only once
                instead of continuing to prompt you until you press the RETURN
                key as the first character of the line.

.* OPTION UPPER,UPLOW
.optix UPPER
.optix UPLOW
UPPER|UPLOW\\\\\when specified with MODIFY, UPPER or UPLOW provides a
                temporary override of the session case setting.  UPLOW causes
                WYLBUR to retain the case (upper, lower, or a mixture) of the
                modified text.  UPPER causes WYLBUR to convert all lowercase
                letters to uppercase as the text is modified.  (Type HELP SET
                TERMINAL CASE for a further description of case settings.)\

.* OPTION OVER
.optix OVER
OVER n\\\\\\\\\\prompts for modifications to any lines which are over n
                characters long.  "n" may be an integer between 0 and 235,
                inclusive.  OVER can be used with UNDER to select lines
                between the specified lengths.

.* OPTION UNDER
.optix UNDER
UNDER n\\\\\\\\\prompts for modifications to any liens which are under n
                characters long.  "n" may be an integer between 0 and 235,
                inclusive.  UNDER can be used with OVER to select lines
                between the specified lengths.

.* OPTION EQUAL
.optix EQUAL
EQUAL n\\\\\\\\\prompts for modifications to any lines which are exactly n
                characters long.  "n" may be an integer between 0 and 235,
                inclusive.

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\LIST, the default, lists the corrected line; this option can
                be suppressed by specifying NOLIST.  For additional
                list-options, type HELP LIST-OPTIONS.  See the description of
                the MODIFY characters above for another way to specify LIST
                and NOLIST.

.* OPTION LENGTH-OPTIONS,LENGTH,NOLENGTH
.optix length-options
length-options\\provide an override for the global length message (established
                with the SET LENGTH command).  If you specify NOLENGTH, the
                warning message about excess length will not be issued (unless
                the line is over 235 characters).  Type HELP LENGTH-OPTIONS
