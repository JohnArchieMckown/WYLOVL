of a string in the specified range of the active, EXEC, or external file.

.* SELECT 'COUNT Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the range in which the number of lines is to be
                determined.  (Type HELP RANGE for a description of range.)\
                If this option is not specified, the entire file is assumed.

.* OPTION STRING
.optix STRING
STRING\{'sstring'|C'sstring'|X'hexadecimal\string'}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\counts the number of occurrences of a given string within the
                range.  (Note that associative ranges count the number of lines
                containing the specified string, not the number of occurrences
                of the string.)\ "sstring" may consist of alphanumeric
                characters, special characters, and blanks.  C'sstring' counts
                the occurrence of a string regardless of case.
                X'hexadecimal\string' is the hexadecimal representation of the
                search string and may consist of any valid hexadecimal
                constants.

.* OPTION EXECUTE
.optix EXECUTE
EXECUTE\\\\\\\\\specifies that the EXEC file, rather than the active file, is
                to be affected.  If this option is not specified, the active
                file is assumed.

.* OPTION FROM
.optix FROM
FROM\dsname\\\\\is the name of an external file from which the specified or
                default range is to be counted.  Type HELP DSNAME for a
                description of dsname.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR,PUBLIC
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to count a data set belonging to an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME
.optix ON
ON\volume\\\\\\\indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ If
                this option is not specified, the volume set with the SET
                VOLUME command will be searched; if no volume is set, the
                system catalog, an index of data sets, will be searched for
                the data set name and volume location.  (All data sets are
                automatically cataloged when they are saved, unless you
                specify otherwise.)\

.* OPTION FORMAT-OPTIONS,EDIT,CARD,PRINT,LRECL,NUMBERED,INTEGER,UNNUMBERED,SEQFLD
.optix format-options
format-options\\allow you to specify the record length and the treatment of
                WYLBUR line numbers in the external file.  The format-options
                NUMBERED, UNNUMBERED, and INTEGER apply only to COUNT FROM;
                they do not apply to COUNT.  Type HELP FORMAT-OPTIONS for a
                description of the format-options.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the COUNT command
                into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for a
                description of these options.

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\requests that all system responses be suppressed if the COUNT
                command is successful.
