.* DESCRIPTION
The SET JOB command allows you to change the permanent options that control
job submission and the authority for issuing JES2 commands.  Once you have
changed the options with the SET JOB command, they will remain in effect until
the account is closed or until you issue another SET JOB command.

The initial values when an account is created are:

     UNNUMBERED, PREFIX=uuugg, COUNT=0, AUTH=COMMUNITY, NONOTIFY

The SHOW JOB command displays job options in effect for the logged-on user or
for the account indicated in the command.  Type HELP SHOW JOB for a more
detailed description of the command.

.* SELECT 'SET JOB Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION GG.UUU,ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR
.optix gg.uuu
gg.uuu\\\\\\\\\\specifies the account to set the default job options of an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  Type HELP
                ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a description of the account-options.  If
                this option is specified, you will be prompted for the
                password of the account before the command is executed.

.* OPTION NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED
.optix NUMBERED
.optix UNNUMBERED
NUMBERED|UNNUMBERED
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\regulates whether numbered job submission is used.  NUMBER
                specifies that columns 73/80 of each line submitted by RUN and
                PUNCH can be replaced with the WYLBUR line number, if the
                columns are blank in that line.  UNNUMBERED, the default for
                new accounts, specifies that columns 73/80 of the lines
                submitted by the RUN and PUNCH command are not to be changed
                by WYLBUR.

.* OPTION PREFIX,NOPREFIX
.optix PREFIX
.optix NOPREFIX
PREFIX=prefix|NOPREFIX
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\PREFIX allows you to specify a new job prefix to be part of
                the WYLBUR generated jobname.  When an account is first
                created, the prefix is set to "uuugg" (where "uuu" is the user
                code and "gg" is the group code).  NOPREFIX specifies that no
                jobname prefix should be set.

.* OPTION COUNT
.optix COUNT
COUNT=n\\\\\\\\\causes a new job count from which the WYLBUR generated jobname
                will be incremented.  When an account is first created, the
                count is set to zero.

.* OPTION NOTIFY,NONOTIFY
.optix NOTIFY
.optix NONOTIFY
NOTIFY|NONOTIFY\NOTIFY sends you a message at the terminal when your batch
                completes execution.  If you do not want a message sent,
                specify NONOTIFY.

.pa
.* OPTION AUTH
.optix AUTH
AUTH={USER|GROUP|COMMUNITY|PUBLIC}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\indicates the group of users that, when the correct password
                is supplied, are allowed to RUN, ALTER, PURGE, FETCH, CANCEL,
                HOLD, and RELEASE jobs belonging to the account specified.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the SET JOB
                command into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for
                a description of these options.

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that all system responses be suppressed if the
                command is successful.
