.* DESCRIPTION
The SET JES command controls the length of the responses from JES-related
commands and the execution of JES-related commands.  (JES stands for Job Entry
Subsystem; JES2 is the name of the job entry subsystem in use at ITS).  SET
JES provides the following functions:

   - sets TERSE or VERBOSE style JES messages

   - makes output and/or execution hold the default on the RUN command.

   - temporarily blocks job submission (this provides a convenient way of
     forcing EXEC files that automatically submit jobs to get an EXEC BREAK).

   - allows you to set session overrides for the permanent JOB and OUTPUT
     options, namely:

        NUMBERED|UNNUMBERED     DEST
        PREFIX                  BIN
        COUNT                   FORMS

   - allows you to be notified when a batch job finishes execution.

The SET JES command (with no options) will set the JES options back to their
logon values.  All SET JES options are in effect only for the duration of the
terminal session.  Type HELP SET JOB and HELP SET OUTPUT for a description of
setting and changing permanent options.

The SHOW JES command displays JES options in effect for the account of the
logged-on user.

.* SELECT 'SET JES Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION TERSE,VERBOSE
.optix TERSE
.optix VERBOSE
TERSE|VERBOSE\\\regulate the length of responses from JES commands.  TERSE
                specifies that responses from the JES commands be in
                abbreviated form.  VERBOSE, the logon default, indicates that
                responses from the JES commands should not be abbreviated.

.* OPTION RUN,NORUN
.optix RUN
.optix NORUN
RUN|NORUN\\\\\\\regulate whether job submission is to be allowed.  RUN, the
                logon default, specifies that job submission is to be allowed.
                NORUN specifies that job submission is not to be allowed.

.* OPTION NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED
.optix NUMBERED
.optix UNNUMBERED
NUMBERED|UNNUMBERED
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\regulates whether numbered job submission is used.  NUMBERED
                specifies that numbered job submission is to be used, even if
                the user's job options specify unnumbered.  UNNUMBERED
.pa
                specifies that unnumbered job submission is to be used, even
                if the user's job options specify numbered.

.* OPTION PREFIX,NOPREFIX
.optix PREFIX
.optix NOPREFIX
PREFIX=prefix|NOPREFIX
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\PREFIX allows you to specify a job prefix when generating a
                WYLBUR jobname.  By default, a WYLBUR-generated jobname has
                the prefix uuugg (uuu is the user code and gg the group
                code).  NOPREFIX undoes the effect of the PREFIX option.

.* OPTION COUNT
.optix COUNT
COUNT=n\\\\\\\\\indicates starting job count used when generating a WYLBUR
                jobname.

.* OPTION DEST
.optix DEST
DEST=destination
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the destination for printing the output of the job.
                Valid destinations include:

                   LOCAL          Forsythe Hall
                   SELF           Forsythe Hall, self-service printer
                   RMTn           Remote work station n

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\If this option is not specified, the destination set with the
                SET OUTPUT command is used.  Type HELP SET OUTPUT DEST for a
                description of how to set a permanent default destination.

.* OPTION BIN
.optix BIN
BIN=nnn\\\\\\\\\causes output to be routed to bin nnn.  If not specified, the
                bin of the logged-on user is assumed.

.* OPTION FORMS
.optix FORMS
FORMS=ffff\\\\\\specifies the form on which job output should be printed,
                where ffff is a 1-4 character forms code.  USE DOC#FORMS
                PUBLIC for a list of the valid codes.  If this option is not
                specified, the forms code set with the SET OUTPUT command is
                used.  Type HELP SET OUTPUT FORMS for a description of SET
                OUTPUT FORMS.

.* OPTION XHOLD,NOXHOLD
.optix XHOLD
.optix NOXHOLD
XHOLD|NOXHOLD\\\regulate whether execution hold is to be assumed for the RUN
                command.  XHOLD specifies that execution hold is to be
                assumed.  NOXHOLD, the logon default, specifies that execution
                hold is not to be assumed.

.* OPTION HOLD,NOHOLD
.optix HOLD
.optix NOHOLD
HOLD|NOHOLD\\\\\regulate whether output hold is assumed for the RUN command.
                HOLD specifies that output hold is to be assumed.  NOHOLD, the
                logon default, specifies that output hold is not to be
                assumed.

.* OPTION NOTIFY,NONOTIFY
.optix NOTIFY
.optix NONOTIFY
{NOTIFY|NONOTIFY}[=gg.uuu]
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\regulates whether you are notified when a batch job finishes
                execution.  NOTIFY allows you to be notified.  A notify
                account (gg.uuu) can be specified; if it is not specified, the
                logged-on account will be used.  Changing the SET JES NOTIFY
                options will not affect jobs that have already been submitted.
                NONOTIFY, the logon default, specifies that notification is
                not requested.
