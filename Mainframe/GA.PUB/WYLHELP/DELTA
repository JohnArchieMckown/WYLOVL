Delta is the line number increment WYLBUR uses to determine line numbers.
Although it may be any number between .001 and 99999.999 inclusively, delta
has a default value of 1.000.

The SET DELTA command allows you to change the default value of delta; the
SHOW DELTA command displays the current value.

WYLBUR determines the delta, or line increment, in either of two ways:

   1.\If the line number to be incremented is an integer or a symbolic line
      number WYLBUR uses the the default delta, unless you have changed it
      with the SET DELTA command.  (Type HELP LINE-NUMBER for a description
      of symbolic line number.)\

   2.\If the line number to be incremented is a decimal number, WYLBUR uses a
      1 in the low-order decimal position as the increment.  For example, if
      the line number is 50.023, the increment would be .001; for line number
      198.3 the line increment would be .1.

If you specify a line number increment (or decrement) in a command, WYLBUR
uses it to determine delta in the same way as the default delta, that is:

   1.\If the line number increment is an integer (e.g., if you issue a command
      such as COLLECT FIRST+2), WYLBUR uses the default delta, unless you have
      changed it with the SET DELTA command.

   2.\If the line number increment is a decimal number, WYLBUR uses a 1 in the
      low-order position.  For example, if you issue the comand COLLECT
      FIRST+2.01, WYLBUR would use a default delta of .01.
