.* DESCRIPTION
The GUESS command searches both WYLBUR's and your private (if you have one
defined) spelling dictionary for the correct spelling of a word.  When you
guess the spelling of a word, WYLBUR will tell you either that the word is
spelled correctly (i.e., that exact word is in the spelling dictionary), or it
will give you a list of similar words.

The SPELL command verifies spelling of the active file.  Type HELP SPELL for a
description of the SPELL command.

word\\\\\\\\\\\\displays the word(s) that closely resemble the spelling of
                the requested word.  For example:

                   Command> guess recieve
                   Similar words:  receive relieve

                If a search of the above form does not find the word you are
                looking for, or if you are looking for a broader class of
                words, you may substitute a question mark (?) or an asterisk
                (*) in any order or combination for the characters that you
                are unsure of, but the first character of the word must be
                alphabetic (A through Z).  A question mark (?) will replace
                characters with an 1-1 substitution and the asterisk (*) will
                replace with 0-n character substitution.  For example:

                   Command> guess f???t

                Will return all words that start with "f", end in "t" and are
                five characters long.

                   Command> guess ma*t*nce

                This command will return all words that start with "ma", have
                a "t" in the middle, and end in "nce".  You might have used
                this command to find the correct spelling of "maintenance".
