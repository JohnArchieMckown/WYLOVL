.* SELECT 'SHOW MAIL Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION GG.UUU,ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR
.optix gg.uuu
gg.uuu\\\\\\\\\\specifies the account to display the mail belonging to an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  Type HELP
                ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a description of the account-options.  If
                this option is specified, you will be prompted for the
                password of the account before the command is executed.

.* OPTION STATUS
.optix STATUS
STATUS\\\\\\\\\\displays your mailbox status (whether you are receiving, not
                receiving or forwarding your mail, and whether you have set a
                message).  To see another account's mailbox status with this
                command, you must have the password.  Compare to the SHOW
                MSTAT command, which provides similar information for another
                account without requiring the password.

.* OPTION SUBJECT
.optix SUBJECT
SUBJECT=subject\displays only kept mail with the specified subject.  The
                subject is the 1-8 character word entered after KEEP in
                response to the DELETE prompt.

.* OPTION KEPT
.optix KEPT
KEPT\\\\\\\\\\\\displays only kept mail.  Kept mail consists of items saved by
                responding KEEP to the DELETE prompt.  Note that the command
                DUMP MAIL KEPT will put your KEPT mail in your active file.
                (Type HELP DUMP for a description of the DUMP command.)\

.* OPTION ALL
.optix ALL
ALL\\\\\\\\\\\\\displays all items (i.e., both new and kept mail).

.* OPTION SUMMARY
.optix SUMMARY
SUMMARY\\\\\\\\\displays only the titles and the number of lines in each item.

.* OPTION DELETE
.optix DELETE
DELETE\\\\\\\\\\causes the items to be deleted after they are displayed.
                Specifying this option has no effect unless NOVERIFY is also
                specified.

.* OPTION NOVERIFY
.optix NOVERIFY
NOVERIFY\\\\\\\\suppresses the DELETE prompt after each item.  The items are
                not erased from your MAIL data set (unless DELETE is also
                specified).

.* OPTION CHRONOLOGICAL
.optix CHRONOLOGICAL
CHRONOLOGICAL\\\causes mail to be displayed from the oldest item to the newest
                item (i.e., chronological order).  The default displays mail
                from newest to oldest.

.* OPTION INTERNAL
.optix INTERNAL
INTERNAL\\\\\\\\displays items in an internal format, that is, the format in
                which the mail is stored in the MAIL data set.  This option is
                primarily used with EXEC files.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the SHOW MAIL
                command into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for
                a description of these options.  You can also type COLLECT
                to the Delete? prompt to put an individual mail message
                into your active file.
