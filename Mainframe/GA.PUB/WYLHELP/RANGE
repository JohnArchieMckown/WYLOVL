A range is a set of lines and it is defined to be either an explicit range or
an associative range.  Each of these is explained below.

The general form of a line number (such as LAST-5, *+1.2) may be used for the
beginning or ending line number of a range.  The line numbers specifying the
beginning or ending line need not exist in the range.  If the range you
specify is an empty range (there are no lines in it), WYLBUR replies with
NO LINES IN RANGE, or a similar message.

Explicit range

.cs 2 off
.us Explicit range

An explicit range is used to specify one or more lines by their numbers,
rather than by their contents.  There are several possible forms for an
explicit range:
.boxon
[x[/y|(z)]|ALL|disjoint\ranges]
.boxoff

x\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the single line with line number x.  This is
                equivalent to the form x/x.

x/y\\\\\\\\\\\\\is the range from line x through line y.  The letters x and y
                should be replaced by line numbers giving the beginning and
                end of the range.  x must be less than or equal to y.  x and y
                are included in the range.  x and y may be symbolic line
                numbers such as FIRST and LAST.

x(z)\\\\\\\\\\\\means z lines beginning with x.  z must be a positive whole
                number, while x must be a line number.  Example:  12(5) means
                5 lines starting with 12.  Line 12 need not exist in the file;
                if it does, it is counted as one of the 5 lines.

.ix ALL 'as range'
.ix range explicit ALL
.ix 'explicit range' ALL
ALL\\\\\\\\\\\\\is equivalent to FIRST/LAST and refers to the entire active
                file.  If an explicit range is not specified, ALL is the
                default.

.ix range explicit disjoint
.ix 'explicit range' disjoint
disjoint\range\\is a list of up to 10 line numbers.  The list may contain
                single lines or groups, the ranges may overlap or they may be
                in any order; however, each group counts as two of the line
                numbers allowed.  The command is performed in the order in
                which you specify the lines.  The ranges may be separated by
                spaces or commas or both.  For example:

                   13,21,20,12/15 LAST-2/LAST 17.2(3)

                Restrictions:

                   1.\A list of ranges referring to a disk file (such as with
                      COPY...FROM) must be in ascending order and cannot
                      overlap.

                   2.\A disjoint range cannot be used if an occurrence list is
                      present in an associative range.  The occurrence list is
                      specified by the option (x,x,...,x/y); see the
                      description of this option below.  For example:

                         LIST 'A' (1) IN 4/6, 6/8, 9

                      is not valid.


.ix range associative
.ix 'associative range'
.cs 2 on
Associative range
-----------------
.cs 2 off
.us Associative range

An associative range is used to specify one or more lines by their contents.
In order to be included in the associative range, the group of lines must be
within the specified explicit range or the default explicit range ALL (i.e.,
the entire file).

Basically, a line is included within an associative range if it has met the
following three conditions in the order specified:

   1.\The line is within the explicit range (specified or default).

   2.\The line passes the string or pattern test, which means:

      a.\If a single string or pattern is specified, that string or pattern
         must or must not occur in the specified or default columns.

      b.\If multiple strings or patterns are specified, those strings or
         patterns must or must not occur in the specified or default
         columns and they must satisfy the logical conditions AND or OR.

   3.\The line is in the specified (if any) occurrence list.

The exact form of an associative range is:
.boxon
[~]{[C]'string'|X'hexadecimal\string'}\[m[/n]]
[{AND|OR}\[~]{[C]'string'|X'hexadecimal\string}\[m[/n]] [(x,x,...,x/y)]]
[P'<[n|*]generic>[string]'] [IN\explicit\range]
.boxoff

.optix '~'
.ix range associative '~'
.cs 2 on
~\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\~ is the logical "not" sign.  It means that the string
                condition is satisfied if the line does NOT contain the string
                specified.

.   .cm this option using the DS12 (9700 printer) or the U340 (3800 printer)
.   .cm character set.
.   .ti set #
.   .ti ~ A1
.do end
~\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\~ is the logical "not" sign (which appears as #~ (a tilde) on
                some terminals and is not available on others).  It means that
                the string condition is satisfied if the line does NOT contain
                the string specified.
.if &u'&chars eq 'DS12' or &u'&chars eq 'U340' .ti set
.cs 1 off

.optix C
.ix range associative C
C\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\allows you to match an associative range regardless of the
                case (upper, lower, or a mixture of upper and lower).  When
                you use C'string', it does not matter whether UPLOW or UPPER
                is in effect.  For example:

                   LIST C'COMMENT'

                will list any lines containing COMMENT, comment, CommENT,
                COmMeNt, and so on.

'string'\\\\\\\\may consist of any combination of alphanumeric characters,
                special characters, and blanks.  The null string '' or "" (a
                pair of apostrophes right next to each other) is also allowed
                and refers to completely blank lines.  The string condition is
                satisfied for a line if it contains the string specified.

.optix X
.ix range associative X
X'hexadecimal\string'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\allows you to use the hexadecimal representation of text when
                specifying an associative range.  For example:

                   LIST X'27'

                will list all lines that have the hexadecimal string '27'.

m[/n]\\\\\\\\\\\restricts the search for 'string' to columns m through n in a
                given line.  If only m is specified, 'string' must begin in
                that column.  If m and n are omitted, the entire line (columns
                1 through 235) is searched.  When the null string is
                specified, m and n must be omitted.

.optix AND
.ix range associative AND
.optix OR
.ix range associative OR
AND|OR\\\\\\\\\\multiple string tests can be specified by using AND or OR.
                All tests separated by AND and any one or more tests separated
                by OR must be successful in order for a line to pass the
                string test.  AND and OR cannot be mixed in a single range.
                The maximum number of string tests that may be specified is
                about 6 (depending on the length of the strings).  A message
                will be given if too many tests have been specified.

.optix P
.ix range associative P
.ix 'associative range' generic
P'<[n|*]generic>[string]'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\indicates that the following string is a pattern (an
                indication of groupings of characters) as opposed to a literal
                string.  Generic descriptors indicate what types of characters
                to search for in a pattern test.  The generic indicators are:

                   <A>  any character from A-Z, upper- or lowercase
                   <N>  a single digit from 0-9
                   <B>  a blank space
                   <S>  a special character (includes punctuation)
                   <C>  a non-printable character (control-character)
                   <X>  any character

                Generic indicators must be listed in angle brackets <>.  You
                can specify a number of indicators with a number or an
                asterisk to represent an indeterminate number.

(x,x,...,x/y)\\\specifies an occurrence list that restricts the range to the
                ordinal subset of lines that meet the string test.  x and/or y
                specify the ordinal positions of that subset.  Thus, (3) and
                (3/7) restrict the subset of lines to the third line and the
                third through seventh lines, respectively, if they are in the
                explicit range and satisfy the string tests.  For example:

                   LIST 'people'(3) 10/15

                lists the third line in the range of lines 10/15 in your
                active file, if it contains the character string 'people'.  A
                disjoint range cannot be used if an occurrence list is
                present.  (See the description of disjoint range above.)\

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\If x and y are omitted, all lines that pass the string test
                and that are in the explicit range are included in the
                associative range.

.optix IN
.ix range associative IN
.ix 'associative range' 'with explicit range'
IN\explicit\range
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\gives an explicit range (see above) which will limit the group
                of lines to be searched.  If an explicit range is not
                specified, the entire file is searched.  The entire file can
                be explicitly specified by IN ALL or IN FIRST/LAST.

NOTE:  All lines except blank lines have one instance of a blank string at the
end of the line.  Thus, the correct associative range to retrieve blank lines
is the null string -- '' or "".  Associative ranges consisting of one or more
blanks, such as '\' or "\", will retrieve lines that have at least one
non-blank character; blank lines will not be retrieved.
