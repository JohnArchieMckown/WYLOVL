TELNET [{name|internet-number} [NOESCAPE] [NOWYL] [KEEP]|session-number]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The TELNET command (abbreviation: TN) establishes a connection to another host
computer locally on SUNet, or nationally or internationally on Internet.  While
under its influence, commands you issue are sent to the other host; WYLBUR
doesn't see them until you either leave the session or pause in it, returning
to WYLBUR.  With the NOWYL option, WYLBUR commands can not be issued while
the Telnet session is still active.

TELNET will automatically return you to WYLBUR when you end your session on the
other host.  To return to WYLBUR temporarily without ending that session (in
other words, take WYLBUR "off hold" and put the other session "on hold"), type
the Escape sequence, which is "Control-]" (press the Control and "]" keys
simultaneously).  Since this sequence isn't particularly easy to remember
unless you use TELNET frequently, WYLBUR reminds you of the sequence each time
you enter or return to the Telnet session.

The Control-] escape sequence takes you to the Telnet command prompt:

 Telnet command (CR=resume)?

The command PAUSE at this point will return you to WYLBUR, leaving your Telnet
session suspended.  Other Telnet commands are also available: type HELP or
a question mark at the Telnet command prompt for a list and brief descriptions.

To return from WYLBUR to your suspended Telnet session, just type TELNET.

You can have several Telnet sessions simultaneously.  You can switch among
them and WYLBUR at the Telnet command prompt, or from WYLBUR with the
"session-number" option.  The SHOW TELNET command can also be helpful then.

If you logoff from WYLBUR, all Telnet sessions will be dropped.

.us Option Description

.* OPTION NAME
.optix name
name\\\\\\\\\\\\name of a SUNet host to which you want to connect.  To
                establish another Forsythe session, use FORSYTHETN (the Telnet
                gateway to Forsythe).  Use this option to start a new session.

.* OPTION INTERNET-NUMBER
.optix internet-number
internet-number\the 4-part number of a host computer on Internet.  For example,
                the Internet number for ForsytheTN is 36.54.0.12.  Use this
                option to start a new session.

.* OPTION NOESCAPE
.optix NOESCAPE
NOESCAPE\\\\\\\\means that the host session cannot be "paused" by using the
                Escape sequence.  Only logging off from the host session will
                return you to WYLBUR.

.* OPTION NOWYL
.optix NOWYL
NOWYL\\\\\\\\\\\means that the host session will not accept any WYLBUR commands
                whenever the Telnet session is "paused."  Only logging off from
                the host session will return you to WYLBUR.

.* OPTION KEEP
.optix KEEP
KEEP\\\\\\\\\\\\means that WYLBUR will keep a log of the Telnet session as a
                new active file, which will be available to you when you leave
                the Telnet session.  (If you don't specify KEEP, the session is
                kept as a temporary active file, which is closed when you leave
                the Telnet session.

.* OPTION SESSION-NUMBER
.optix session-number
session-number\\the number of the previously established Telnet session you
                want to return to. They are numbered from 1, one by one, as
                they are opened; you can see a numbered list of open Telnet
                sessions with the SHOW TELNET command.  If you leave off the
                number when you have several open, you will be returned to
                the last-used session.
