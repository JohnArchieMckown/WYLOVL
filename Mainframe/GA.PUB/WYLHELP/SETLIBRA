SET LIBRARY [library]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The SET LIBRARY command allows you to set a 1-8 character name that WYLBUR
uses as the default library name when forming a dsname.  (Type HELP LIBRARY
for a definition of library.)\ The library name you set should conform to the
data set naming conventions, except that it cannot exceed eight characters.
(Type HELP DSNAME for a description of these conventions.)\

If you omit the library name when specifying a member (e.g., SAVE #DATA),
WYLBUR assumes the library named LIB unless you have set a name with the SET
LIBRARY command.

The SHOW LIBRARY command displays the current value for library.
