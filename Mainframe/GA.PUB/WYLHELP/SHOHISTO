.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW HISTORY command displays the contents of your command history.  By
default, it only shows the last 5 typed commands, unless you use the n or ALL
options.  SHOW HISTORY ALL displays all of the commands in your command
history, up to the last 100 commands.

Each command is displayed with a number, the number one being the first typed
command of your WYLBUR session.  You can then recall any commands in your
history either by number or by stem.  For example:

   Command> @         <-- displays the last typed command.
   Command> @sho      <-- displays the last typed command starting with "sho".
   Command> @20       <-- displays the command numbered 20 in your command
                          history.

The SHOW HISTORY command followed by a number displays the last n commands in
the command history, up to the last 100 commands.

The SET HISTORY command lets you alter the number of commands displayed by the
SHOW HISTORY command without any other options; type HELP SET HISTORY for
details.  The CLEAR HISTORY erases the contents of your command history.  Type
HELP CLEAR HISTORY for details.
