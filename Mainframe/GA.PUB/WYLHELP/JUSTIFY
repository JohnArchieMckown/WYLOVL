.* DESCRIPTION
The JUSTIFY command formats paragraphs with whatever margins or indentations
you choose, regardless of how the text was entered.  WYLBUR adjusts the
contents of the lines in the specified range so that each line contains the
exact number of specified LENGTH characters.

When text must be moved from one line to another during justifying, WYLBUR
splits the text at a blank (a word is never split onto two lines); it joins
the rearranged text with a single blank.  WYLBUR inserts two blanks between
the two parts, if the first part ends in one of the following characters:

     ?\:\.\!

It pads the lines with blanks, if necessary.  (If you do not want lines padded
with blanks, use the ALIGN command.  Type HELP ALIGN for a description of the
command.)\ WYLBUR renumbers the portion of the file that was justified.

In Page WYLBUR, use the ESC Z sequence to justify paragraphs of
text.

.* SELECT 'JUSTIFY Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the upper and lower limit of a group of lines to be
                justified.  This option is required and must be specified
                first.  Justification restarts whenever nonconsecutive lines
                in a range are encountered or when a new range is started, as
                in a disjoint range.  (Type HELP RANGE for a description of a
                disjoint range.)\

.* OPTION LENGTH
.optix LENGTH
LENGTH=nnn\\\\\\specifies the length to which the line will be justified (nnn
                is a value of 1 to 235 characters).  If this option is not
                included, the lines will be justified to the current value of
                LENGTH.  (Type HELP SET LENGTH for a description of LENGTH.)\

.* OPTION MARKER
.optix MARKER
MARKER=c\\\\\\\\c is any character.  Lines containing the marker character in
                column 1 will remain unchanged and the justification process
                will be restarted with a new paragraph.  The characters:

                   (\)\"\,\'\=

                must be in quotation marks.  Blank lines are always treated as
                marker lines.

.* OPTION INDENT
.optix INDENT
INDENT=x[[+]y|-y]
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\justifies indented material (i.e., text not beginning in
                column 1) that is ordinarily ignored if this option is not
                specified.  x is an integer and specifies that lines indented
                x spaces should be used for continuation lines of a paragraph.
                y is a positive or negative integer and specifies that any
                line with ADDITIONAL indentation of y spaces should be used
.pa
                for the first line of a paragraph.  The default value of y is
                0.  A negative value produces "hanging indents".

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\If EVEN is not specified, only text whose indentation matches
                the specified INDENT values will be justified.  Text beginning
                in column 1 has the indentation value of 0.  If the INDENT
                option is not specified, a default value of INDENT=0\0 is
                used.  Examples of this option are included below, following
                the option descriptions.

.* OPTION EVEN
.optix EVEN
EVEN\\\\\\\\\\\\must be used to cause any change in the existing indentation
                of text.  If EVEN is specified, WYLBUR ignores existing
                indentations, justifies all non-marker lines using the
                indentations specified or defaulted, and starts a new
                paragraph only after a blank line, a line with the marker
                character, or when the range is not consecutive.  An example
                of this option is included below, following the option
                descriptions.

.* OPTION SPACE
.optix SPACE
SPACE\\\\\\\\\\\removes extra spaces that may have been inserted by a previous
                JUSTIFY command.  Unless SPACE is used, extra blanks from the
                previous justification or alignment will be kept as part of
                the text when it is rejustified.  Two blanks are always left
                after the characters:

                   ?\:\.\!

.* OPTION NUMBER
.optix NUMBER
NUMBER\\\\\\\\\\causes the entire file to be renumbered after the
                justification process is complete.  The starting line number
                and the line increment will both be delta.  (Type HELP DELTA
                for a definition of delta.)\ If this option is not specified,
                only those lines in the aligned range will be renumbered.

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\LIST specifies that the line be listed after it is justified.
                NOLIST is the default.  For additional list-options, type HELP
                LIST-OPTIONS.

.us Examples to illustrate the use of options, INDENT=x [y] and EVEN:

Assume the range to be justified consists of two paragraphs.  Each paragraph
contains contiguous lines of text beginning in column 6, and the paragraphs
are separated by a blank line.

Example 1:   You want to retain column 6 as the beginning of all lines and to
justify them to a uniform length of 68.  To accomplish this, you would give
the command:

     JUSTIFY range LENGTH=68 INDENT=5

Example 2:   You want to justify the two paragraphs to length 68, with the
first line of each paragraph beginning in column 10 and the body of the
paragraph beginning in column 6.  You would give the command:

     JUSTIFY range LENGTH=68 INDENT=5+4 EVEN

WYLBUR indents the first line 9 spaces (5+4) and the body 5 spaces, until the
blank line between the paragraphs is encountered, signaling the beginning of a
new paragraph.  EVEN is necessary because you want the indentation of the text
changed (i.e., the indentation for the first line of each paragraph is to
change from 5 to 9).  In the first example, EVEN is not necessary because the
indentation of text is NOT to be changed.
