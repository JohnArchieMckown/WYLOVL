.* DESCRIPTION

                  ***  EXPERIMENTAL FACILITY  ***
             ***  SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE  ***

This command disconnects the current VTAM application connected to with the
VLOGON command.  The "option" is a single character consisting of either:

I   (Immediate) will request that an immediate logoff request be sent to the
                application.

F   (Force)     will force a logoff, by causing a "LOSTTERM" error to be sent
                to the application.

Note that this command only sends a request to the application.  The
application must perform the actual logoff.

Type HELP VISTA for more information on the VTAM terminal interface.
