.* DESCRIPTION
The ON ATTN statement lets you specify a command to be executed when an ATTN
is pressed.  This lets you set a general ATTN exit for a procedure or XPROC.
The specified command may be a single command or may PCALL or XCALL an
separate ATTN procedure.  The ATTN procedure should be used primarily for
terminating or restarting extended EXEC files.

When the user first presses ATTN, the attention exit is executed.  Any
subsequent ATTNs are ignored.  When the first ATTN is encountered, WYLBUR sets
the following variables:

ATTN     (boolean)    TRUE if there has been an ATTN, FALSE otherwise.

ATTNINFO  (string)    a message indicating where the ATTN occurred:
                      'EXEC break at line 21 of EXEC:(Active file)'

ATTNID    (string)    an eight-character ID for the ATTN:
                      'ATTN     ' or 'NOATTN  '.

Since subsequent ATTNs are ignored, it is wise to give the user a chance to
exit in your ATTN routine.  The ON ATTN REENABLE statement re-enables the ATTN
exit.  The CLEAR ATTN command clears the attention variables.  ON ATTN CLEAR
clears any attention exit set.

If the ATTN option is used on the LIST command (LIST ATTN=error), it takes
precedence over the ATTN exit established with the ON ATTN command.  Also, if
an attention occurs on a TRY command, the ATTN routine is not invoked.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the command to execute when ATTN is pressed.  This may be a
                single command, including an XCALL or PCALL command.

.* OPTION NOINTERRUPTIBLE
.optix NOINTERRUPTIBLE
NOINTERRUPTIBLE\specifies that no individual command in the procedure should
                be interrupted with an ATTN; the ATTN will occur after the
                command completes.  The default is INTERRUPTIBLE, except
                within ATTN routines.

.* OPTION INTERRUPTIBLE
.optix INTERRUPTIBLE
INTERRUPTIBLE\\\specifies that individual commands can be interrupted by an
                ATTN in an EXEC.  This is the default setting.

.* OPTION REENABLE
