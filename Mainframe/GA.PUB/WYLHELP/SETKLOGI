.* DESCRIPTION

The SET KLOGIN command lets you or other specified SUNet ID owners logon to
your Forsythe account using a SUNet ID and password instead of the Forsythe
account and password. This is done not through the normal Forsythe logon
procedure (with the Forsythe "Account?" and "Password?" prompts) but through
a telnet session using Kerberos security software (the K in KLOGIN stands for
Kerberos), which is built into MacLeland, PC-Leland and UNIX security kits
available to Stanford users.  The kerberized logon method does not replace the
normal method; however, it is more secure, providing much greater security
both to the authorization ID and password and to the session itself, which is
encrypted.

The SET KLOGIN command provides the list of SUNet IDs you authorize to logon
to your Forsythe account; for most people, it is simply their own SUNet ID and
none other.  Multiple SUNet IDs may be specified when a Forsythe account is
shared by multiple people.  If the list includes more than a couple people, the
ACTIVE or "FROM dsname" options may simplify your handling of it.

A SET KLOGIN command always replaces the current settings.  To add an ID to the
list of SUNet IDs already in effect, be sure your new SET KLOGIN command
includes the current ones too, because the new ID list will completely replace
the older list.

When you issue the command, you will be asked for your Forsythe password in
order for Forsythe to verify that you (the person issuing the command) have
password access to the account.

To see your current klogin list, issue the command SHOW KLOGIN.

To clear your current klogin list, issue the command CLEAR KLOGIN.

.* SELECT 'SET KLOGIN Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION SUNETID-LIST
.optix sunetid-list
sunetid-list\\\\specifies one or more login SUNet IDs, separated from each
                other by commas, blanks or a combination.  The SUNet IDs are
                not verified in any way, so be sure they are correct when you
                enter them.  Use the "login" form of the SUNet ID (3-8
                alphanumeric characters), not the Full Name or Alternate Name
                forms.

.* OPTION ACTIVE
.optix ACTIVE
ACTIVE\\\\\\\\\\says that the list of SUNet IDs is in your active file. Each
                SUNet ID should be on a separate line.  You can put the current
                list into your active file with the SHOW KLOGIN command, using
                the COLLECT option.

.* OPTION FROM DSNAME
.optix FROM dsname
FROM dsname\\\\\says that the list of SUNet IDs is in the named data set. (Type
                HELP DSNAME for a description of dsname.) The list is read from
                the data set only at the time the command is issued. Changes
                made to the list in the data set will not take effect unless
                and until you issue another "SET KLOGIN FROM dsname" command.
