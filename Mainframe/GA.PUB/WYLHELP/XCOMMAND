XCOMMAND command

.* DESCRIPTION
(** Extended EXECs only **)
The XCOMMAND statement defines a command to be executed when the XPROC exits
and before the Command> prompt is issued.  This is most often used in exit
routines in Extended EXECs, specifically to call non-Extended EXECs.  From
within SPIRES, you must have WYLBUR set for this to work.

For example:

     PROC EXIT () BEGIN
          ...
          XEXIT exec from #cleanup
     END
