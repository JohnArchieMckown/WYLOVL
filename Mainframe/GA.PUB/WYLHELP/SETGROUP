.* DESCRIPTION
The SET GROUP command sets the value of the GROUP field to a specified group
code or resets it to the logged-on group code.  Note that all charges for the
session are incurred by the logged-on user regardless of the value of GROUP.

You can use SET GROUP in conjunction with the SET USER command to access jobs
and data sets from an account with a group code other than that of the
logged-on user.  You can also use the SET ACCOUNT command for this purpose.

SHOW GROUP displays the current value of ACCOUNT (that is, the GROUP and USER
codes), as well as the logged-on ACCOUNT.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION GG
.optix gg
gg\\\\\\\\\\\\\\sets the default value of the group code to gg.  The GROUP
                value will be used in forming a dsname.  During the logon
                procedure, GROUP is set to the group code typed in response to
                the logon prompt "Account?".  By issuing the SET GROUP command
                without options, the value of GROUP is reset to the logon
                value.

.* OPTION PASSWORD
.optix PASSWORD
PASSWORD\\\\\\\\allows jobs and data sets belonging to the user whose account
                is specified by the values of the USER and GROUP fields to be
                treated as if they belonged to the logged-on user.  You will
                be prompted for and must respond with the correct password for
                that user.  You may then SAVE, CATALOG, RECATALOG, and
                UNCATALOG data sets or PURGE, PRINT, and FETCH jobs belonging
                to that user without being prompted each time for the correct
                password.
