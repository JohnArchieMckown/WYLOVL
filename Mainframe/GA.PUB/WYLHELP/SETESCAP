.* DESCRIPTION
The SET ESCAPE command allows you to set an ESCAPE character.  The ESCAPE
character signals the WYLBUR preprocessor that text substitution and/or
expression evaluation should be made in a command line before WYLBUR executes
the command.  The logon default for the ESCAPE character is null ('').  SHOW
ESCAPE displays the current ESCAPE character.  These commands are primarily
useful in EXEC files.
