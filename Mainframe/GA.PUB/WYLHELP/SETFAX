.* DESCRIPTION
The SET FAX command sets default options that will be used by the FAX command,
which sends WYLBUR files to a remote fax machine.  It remains in effect for
the duration of your terminal session.

The most common use of the SET FAX command is to set default "sender"
information, that is, information about you, which will appear on the cover
sheet of subsequent faxes in this session.  Frequent users of the FAX command
often put the SET FAX command with appropriate sender information into their
logon exec files.

It is also useful in situations where the length of the FAX command with all
the options you want would exceed 235 characters, the limit for WYLBUR
commands.  You can put some of the options onto the SET FAX command, and then
put the rest on the FAX command.  Almost all options of the FAX command are
allowed on the SET FAX command as well.  Note, however, that the SET
FAX command is limited to 211 characters.

The SET FAX command completely replaces any previous SET FAX command; all
options you want to set must be on the SET FAX command at once.

The SHOW FAX command will show you what options are currently set by the
SET FAX command.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION TO
.optix TO
TO\phone-number\indicates the phone number of the fax machine you want to
                receive the transmission. Because this is a machine-to-machine
                service, the number must be for a fax machine that answers the
                the phone itself. The phone number can include only numerals
                and optional hyphens (for clarity).  For on-campus faxes with
                723- and 725- prefixes, you can omit the "72" portion.  For
                off-campus faxes, you can omit the "9" prefix you normally
                need to place an off-campus call.  For calls out of the 415
                area code, prefix the area code with a "1". If the receiving
                fax machine is outside the local area, you will need to use the
                AUTH option (see below) to specify your Stanford long-distance
                authorization code for proper billing of the long-distance
                phone charges.  International calls (that is, those requiring
                the 011 prefix) and credit-card calls are not supported.

.* OPTION AUTH
.optix AUTH
AUTH=nnnnnnn\\\\supplies your Stanford long-distance authorization code, a
                7-digit number assigned to Stanford community members by
                Communication Services. If you omit this option but the phone
                number you give for the receiving fax machine is a
                long-distance one, you will be prompted for it when you issue
                the FAX command.

.* OPTION SENDER
.optix SENDER
SENDER='sender info'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\provides information about you, the fax sender, for the fax's
                cover sheet. Up to 128 characters of information may be given.
                Usually you will want to include your name, your phone number,
                and perhaps an address and return fax phone number.  Semicolons
                can be used within the field as line separators for up to
                5 lines.  An example:

                SENDER='Lulu Sununu;Polya Hall, Stanford Univ.;(415)555-4965'

                On the cover sheet, this would appear as:

                From: Lulu Sununu
                      Polya Hall, Stanford Univ.
                      (415)555-4965

                If you omit this option, and you do not include it on the FAX
                command, you will be prompted for recipient information.

.* OPTION RECIPIENT
.optix RECIPIENT
RECIPIENT='recipient info'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\provides information for the cover sheet about the person who
                should receive the fax.  Up to 128 characters of information
                may be given.  Usually you will want to include the person's
                name, phone number, and perhaps an address.  Semicolons
                can be used within the field as line separators for up to 5
                lines.  An example:

                RECIPIENT='Elke Meeno;Royal Typewriters, Inc;Bldg 3;154-2355'

                On the cover sheet, this would appear as:

                To: Elke Meeno
                    Royal Typewriters, Inc.
                    Bldg 3
                    154-2355

                If you omit this option, and you do not include it on the FAX
                command, you will be prompted for recipient information.

.* OPTION SUBJECT,HEADER
.optix SUBJECT
.optix HEADER
SUBJECT='subject'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\permits a title of up to 120 characters to be printed on the
                fax's header sheet of your output.  If this option is specified
                with the TITLE option, the SUBJECT takes the place of the TITLE
                on the header sheet of your output.  This option is also called
                the HEADER option, and does have a higher length limit here
                than on the PRINT command.  If you omit this option, and you do
                not include it on the FAX command, you will be prompted for
                subject information.

.* OPTION FROM
.optix FROM
FROM\dsname\\\\\specifies an external data set to be submitted for faxing
                (instead of the active file).

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME
.optix ON
ON\volume\\\\\\\indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ If
                this option is not specified, the volume set with the SET
                VOLUME command will be searched; if no volume is set, the
                system catalog, an index of data sets, will be searched for
                the data set name and volume location.  (All data sets are
                automatically cataloged when they are saved, unless you
                specify otherwise.)

.* OPTION NOSEPARATORS
.optix NOSEPARATORS
NOSEPARATORS\\\\suppresses the cover page for your fax; no cover page is sent.

.* OPTION BLOCK
.optix BLOCK
BLOCK=block\\\\\specifies the time block when the data can be faxed.  Valid
                time blocks are:  PEAK, DAY, EVENING, NIGHT, WEEKEND and ANY.
                They may be abbreviated to P, D, E, N, W and A.  ANY is the
                default.  For the current time block schedule, see DOC#SCHEDULE
                PUBLIC.

.* OPTION HOLD,H
.optix HOLD
HOLD\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that the job is to be placed into output hold.  The
                fax will not be sent until the job is released, using the
                RELEASE command.

.* OPTION KEEP
.optix KEEP
KEEP\\\\\\\\\\\\returns a job to the system output queue after the job has been
                sent for faxing, putting the kept "input" in output hold.  This
                option provides a backup for output that is difficult or costly
                to reproduce.  If a job is lost, the output can be released
                from output hold and refaxed.  When KEEP is specified, output
                remains in output hold for 48 hours, then is purged
                automatically.  The time remaining in output hold is not
                decremented during WEEKEND hours.

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\requests that all system responses be suppressed if the FAX
                command is successful.

.* OPTION CHARS
.optix CHARS
CHARS=a|(a,b[,c[,d]])
.cs 2 on
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies one or multiple character sets.  The most common set
                is called Courier, specified as CU10 (for 10-pitch), CU12 and
                CU15 character sets.  An Italic set (IT10, IT12, etc.) is also
                available.  These are all monospaced fonts.   Other character
                set possibilities are proportionally spaced and are not easy
                to use with WYLBUR; they are measured in point size, not pitch.
                They include HEnn, HBnn and HInn (Helvetica normal, bold and
                Italic respectively) and TRnn, TBnn and TInn (Times Roman
                normal, bold and Italic).  The "nn" is the point size, where
                1 point is 1/72nd inch.  12-point is close to 10-pitch size.
                If multiple character sets are named, character set selection
                characters are expected to be in column 1, unless CC is also
                specified (which indicated carriage control characters in
                column 1), in which case the character selection characters are
                expected in column 2.

.* OPTION INDENT
.optix INDENT
INDENT=n\\\\\\\\inserts n blanks at the left of each listed line.

.* OPTION DOUBLE,TRIPLE
.optix DOUBLE
.optix TRIPLE
DOUBLE|TRIPLE\\\produce a listing with double or triple spacing, respectively.
                Single spacing is the default.

.* OPTION EJECT
.optix EJECT
EJECT=n\\\\\\\\\EJECT specifies the number of lines to be faxed before the
                page is ejected.  This number must be between 0 and 255.  If
                EJECT is not specified, a page eject will occur after 60 lines
                of printing unless the FCB setting changes the default number
                of lines per page.

.* OPTION LANDSCAPE
.optix LANDSCAPE
LANDSCAPE\\\\\\\requests printing in landscape orientation with the lines
                parallel to the long side of the page.

.* OPTION FCB
.optix FCB
FCB=cccc\\\\\\\\specifies a 1-4 character code to be used by the "forms control
                buffer".  Most commonly, this is a number from 1 to 20
                indicating the number of lines of text to print per vertical
                inch.  For a standard sheet, FCB=6 produces 60 lines per page.
                FCB=6 is the default.

.* OPTION POSTSCRIPT
.optix POSTSCRIPT
POSTSCRIPT\\\\\\specifies that the file to be faxed is a PostScript command
                file that should be interpreted prior to being faxed. This
                option lets you upload PostScript versions of documents from
                your microcomputer so that the document will be faxed just as
                it would look if it were printed to a PostScript printer.

.* OPTION COLUMNS,COLS
.optix COLUMNS
COLUMNS=m[/n]\\\will cause only columns m through n of a line to be listed.
                If the COLUMNS option is not specified, m defaults to column
                1; n to column 235.  (The actual number of columns that can be
                faxed depends on the options: FORMS, CHARS, and list-options.)

.* OPTION FLASH
.optix FLASH
.cs 2 on
FLASH=ffff\\\\\\specifies a forms flash overlay.  BAR4 prints four grey bars
                per inch in landscape mode.  FLASH=MEMO prints a Stanford
                University Memo overlay.

.* OPTION TITLE
.optix TITLE
TITLE='title'\\\permits a title of up to 72 characters to be printed on the
                output before the listing of the file.   If no SUBJECT option
                is specified, this will also appear as the subject on the fax's
                header sheet.

.* OPTION DOCUMENT
.optix DOCUMENT
DOCUMENT\\\\\\\\is a short form for specifying the options:

                   NONUMBERED,UPLOW

.* OPTION MEMO
.optix MEMO
MEMO\\\\\\\\\\\\is a short form for specifying the options:

                  UNNUMBERED,INDENT=10,EJECT=56,FLASH=MEMO,FCB=MEM6,CHARS=TN10

                This causes your fax to print as if it were on Stanford
                University interoffice memo paper.

.* OPTION UNFORMATTED
.optix UNFORMATTED
UNFORMATTED\\\\\prints any special WYLBUR formatting instructions like those
                for bold, italic, and underlining instead of executing them.
                FORMATTED is the default.

.* OPTION CC
.optix CC
CC\\\\\\\\\\\\\\CC causes the character in column 1 of each line in the
                range to be treated as a printer control character.

.* OPTION NOCC
.optix NOCC
NOCC\\\\\\\\\\\\overrides the CC option.  This option is only useful if CC is
                included in an OPTIONS: line in the data set you want faxed.

.* OPTION MARKER
.optix MARKER
MARKER=c\\\\\\\\causes a page eject at any point in the range where there is a
                marker character in column 1 (c is any character).  Lines with
                the marker character in column 1 will not be faxed.  Enclose
                the marker character in quotation marks or apostrophes if it is
                a lowercase letter or one of these characters:  ( ) " ' ,

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\UNNUMBERED is the default for the FAX command: only the text
                (and not the line numbers) in the range is faxed. NUMBERED
                lists the text and line numbers of the specified range.
                NONUMBERED lists the text only and replaces the line numbers
                with blanks.  For a description of all the list options, type
                HELP LIST-OPTIONS.
