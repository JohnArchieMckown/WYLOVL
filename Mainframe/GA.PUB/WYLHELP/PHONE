.item 'PHONE Command' 'Updated 11/19/93 by JNK'
PHONE name

The PHONE command sends a request across the SUNet network to a personal name
server maintained by IR/Networking systems called the "whois directory".  The
whois directory contains information from the Faculty/Staff Directory and from
student directories maintained by IR and is used to handled WHOIS inquiries
over SUNET.  (Type HELP WHOIS for more information.)

The name can be a person's last name:

    Command> phone smith

or the first initial or initials followed by the last name:

    Command> phone absmith

or some portion of a name (use "..." to match anything):

    Command> phone benn...

The "name" may also be a University business phone number, making the command
work like a reverse directory.  (Be sure to include the hyphen.)

    Command> phone 3-4420

The PHONE command's information is actually stored on another computer on
SUNet.  If you receive a message such as "Connection refused" when you try the
PHONE command, it usually means that the other computer is not accepting
requests or the link between computers is not functioning.

Type HELP WHOIS for information on the WHOIS command, which provides more
information than PHONE.
