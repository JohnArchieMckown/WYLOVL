.* DESCRIPTION
The SET TERMINAL command allows you to set or change the terminal dependent
options such as case settings, screen width and height, message receiving
capabilities, etc.

The SHOW TERMINAL command lists the terminal options currently in effect.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION TERMINAL-TYPE,TYPE
.optix terminal-type
terminal-type\\\specifies the terminal type (for example, VT100 for a DEC
                VT100 terminal).  Type HELP TERMINALS for a list of terminals
                that are supported in Page WYLBUR.

.* OPTION BREAK,NOBREAK
.optix BREAK
.optix NOBREAK
BREAK|NOBREAK\\\NOBREAK keeps your typing from being interrupted to receive a
                message from another user.  Instead, the message will be typed
                after the input line is completed.  BREAK is the logon
                default.

.* OPTION COMM,NOCOMM
.optix COMM
.optix NOCOMM
COMM|NOCOMM\\\\\COMM, the logon default, allows you to receive user messages
                from other logged-on users that are sent via the TO command
                and to be notified if user messages are sent via the SEND or
                MAIL commands.  NOCOMM prohibits such messages from being
                received at the terminal.  Use the NOMSG option if you wish to
                prohibit any messages (user or system) from being received.

.* OPTION MSG,MESSAGE,NOMSG,NOMESSAGE
.optix MSG
.optix NOMSG
MSG|NOMSG\\\\\\\NOMSG prohibits any messages from being received at the
                terminal.  Even operator and system messages are blocked in
                this mode.  If you want to block messages from other users
                (but not the operator) use the NOCOMM option instead.  MSG is
                the logon default.

.* OPTION ECHO,NOECHO
.optix ECHO
.optix NOECHO
ECHO|NOECHO\\\\\ECHO, the logon default, if you logon through a PDP terminal
                controller (e.g., class code 20), specifies that the terminal
                controller echoes the input.  NOECHO, the logon default for
                the other terminal controllers (e.g., class code 10),
                specifies that the terminal rather than the terminal
                controller echoes the input.  Use the NOECHO option when you
                see double characters displayed at your terminal during input.

.* OPTION IDLES
.optix IDLES
IDLES=n\\\\\\\\\controls the number of idle characters added by the system
                after the carriage return, line feed, and tab functions, where
                n can be from 0 to 99.  When n is greater than 1, it is n
                times the standard idle settings.  The standard idle settings
                are set with the command SET TERMINAL IDLES=1 (or just SET
                TERMINAL IDLES) and they are as follows:

                   IDLES: CRI=20,2 LFI=20 HTI=20,2 CSI=0

                The logon default is to have NO idle characters generated.
                Idle characters are required by some terminals to allow time
                for the terminal to perform whatever function is required.
                (The system uses the ASCII "NUL" character as an idle.)\

.* OPTION CRI
.optix CRI
CRI=f[,d]\\\\\\\sets the carriage return idles.  f is a fixed delay ranging
                from 0 to 5000 millisecond.  d is the per character delay,
                ranging from 0 to 5000 milliseconds.  The standard setting for
                carriage return idles (i.e., CRI=20,2) can be set with the
                IDLES option.

.* OPTION LFI
.optix LFI
LFI=f\\\\\\\\\\\sets the line feed idles.  f is a fixed delay ranging from 0
                to 5000 milliseconds.  The standard setting for line feed
                idles (i.e., LFI=20) can be set with the IDLES option.

.* OPTION HTI
.optix HTI
HTI=f[,d]\\\\\\\sets the horizontal tab idles.  f is a fixed delay ranging
                from 0 to 5000 millisecond.  d is the per character delay,
                ranging from 0 to 5000 milliseconds.  The standard setting for
                horizontal tab idles (i.e., HTI=20,2) can be set with the
                IDLES option.

.* OPTION CSI
CSI=f\\\\\\\\\\\sets the clear screen idles.  f is a fixed delay ranging from
                0 to 5000 milliseconds.  The standard setting for clear idles
                (i.e., CSI=0) can be set with the IDLES option.

.* OPTION NOIDLES
.optix NOIDLES
NOIDLES\\\\\\\\\resets the number of idle characters generated to zero, the
                logon default.

.* OPTION XON,NOXON
.optix XON
.optix NOXON
XON|NOXON\\\\\\\For microprocessor users.  In XON mode, the logon default, the
                last character of every terminal read prompt is the "XON"
                (ASCII DC1) control character.  In NOXON mode, no special
                prompt ending character is added.

.* OPTION BACK,NOBACK
.optix BACK
.optix NOBACK
.ix 'CONTROL-X key'
.ix key CONTROL-X
BACK|NOBACK\\\\\BACK allows you to enter the backspace character as data, and
                CONTROL-X (ASCII CAN) erases the previous character.  In
                NOBACK mode, the logon default, a backspace character is
                interpreted as a deletion of the previous character.

.* OPTION FILTER,NOFILTER
.optix FILTER
FILTER|NOFILTER\FILTER, the default, filters on input any control characters
                which would otherwise be invisible (line feed, backspace,
                tab, and the bell are left alone.)\ NOFILTER does not filter
                control characters on input.

.* OPTION FAST,SLOW
.optix FAST
.optix SLOW
FAST|SLOW\\\\\\\FAST causes the pre-set tabs to be used (instead of multiple
                blanks) when listing output lines.  (This speeds up the
                listing of lines.)\ SLOW, the logon default, disables this
                function.  (Type HELP SET TABS for a description of setting
                tabs.)\

.* OPTION APL,APLB
.optix APL
.optix APLB
.if &u'&chars eq 'DS12' .tr 4A 71  ;.* To get a caret with DS12 character set.
APL|APLB\\\\\\\\Both the APL and APLB options are used to set up the correct
                character translation code in order to use the APL language.
                (When you specify APL or APLB, BACK also goes into effect.)\
                APL sets the terminal for APL following the typewriter pairing
                of the keys.  The majority of APL terminals follow this
                layout.  To determine if this is the correct setting for your
                terminal, look at the symbol above number '0' on the keyboard.
                If it is a '^' (a caret), then this is the correct
                translation.  APLB sets the terminal for APL following the
                bit-paired pairing of the keys.  To determine if this is the
                correct setting for your terminal, look at the symbol above
                number '0' on the keyboard.  If it is blank, then this is the
                correct translation.
.if &u'&chars eq 'DS12' .tr 4A 4A

.* OPTION NOAPL,NOAPLB
.optix NOAPL
.optix NOAPLB
NOAPL|NOAPLB\\\\NOAPL or NOAPLB resets the translation code from APL or APLB
                to ASCII (and resets BACK to NOBACK).  NOAPL or NOAPLB are the
                logon defaults and provide the standard translation.

.* OPTION CASE,UPPER,UPLOW
.optix UPPER
.optix UPLOW
UPPER|UPLOW\\\\\In UPPER mode all input text is automatically converted to
                uppercase, regardless of the case of the text entered in.  In
                UPLOW mode, the logon default, the case of the input text will
                not be changed.  To remind you that UPLOW is in effect,
                WYLBUR's command and line number prompts end with a right
                angle bracket.  For example:  14.\> and Command>.  If UPPER is
                in effect, WYLBUR's command and line number prompts end with a
                question mark.

.* OPTION WIDTH
.optix WIDTH
WIDTH=n\\\\\\\\\specifies the width of your terminal line, where n is the
                number of characters in the line and can be an integer value
                from 1 to 255.  For most CRT terminals, the width is 80
                characters.  WIDTH=80 is the logon default.  This option can
                be used to allow WYLBUR to better format the responses to
                certain commands (e.g.\SHOW USERS) or it can be used in
                conjunction with SET TERMINAL HEIGHT.

.* OPTION HEIGHT,NOHEIGHT
.optix HEIGHT
.optix NOHEIGHT
.ix '(BREAK)'
.ix 'BREAK key'
.ix key BREAK
.ix 'RETURN key'
.ix key RETURN
HEIGHT=n[,m]|NOHEIGHT
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\HEIGHT=n specifies that n is the maximum number of lines to be
                written to the terminal before a page pause.  n must be an
                integer value from 0 to 255.  (A page pause means that the
                system pauses, allowing you to read the information displayed
                at your terminal.)\

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\After a page pause, you can press the RETURN key to resume the
                listing of lines.  You can press the BREAK key after a page
                pause, or during the listing of lines, to interrupt the
                process.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\WYLBUR displays a colon (:) at your terminal to indicate the
                page pause.  Under most circumstances, you can enter a new
                command immediately following the colon, without returning to
                command mode.  A new command will not be accepted if you are
                executing an EXEC file or writing text from an ORVYL program.
                NOHEIGHT, the logon default, disables this page pause feature.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Note that the WIDTH must be set accurately in order for the
                system to count "wraparound" lines correctly.  The initial
                WIDTH setting at logon is 80 (the correct setting for most CRT
                terminals).  The SET TERMINAL WIDTH command can be used to
                change the width setting.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The optional second number, "m" in "HEIGHT=n,m", specifies
                the actual number of lines (rows) available for full-screen
                programs like Page WYLBUR or Prism to use.  By default, its
                value is 24, though it will be set to something different by
                a SET TERMINAL SAMSON command if the actual terminal window
                size is different.  Setting "m" sets the THEIGHT variable.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Note that Page WYLBUR will ignore the "m" number
                if you issue the SET TERMINAL HEIGHT command after issuing any
                VIEW command; Page WYLBUR remembers the window height from the
                prior VIEW command, and SET TERMINAL HEIGHT will not reset it
                for Page WYLBUR.  Instead you can use the HEIGHT option on the
                SET VIEW command to reset the window height in Page WYLBUR, or
                else re-issue the "SET TERMINAL terminal-type" command.


.* OPTION TYPEAHEAD,NOTYPEAHEAD
.optix TYPEAHEAD
.optix NOTYPEAHEAD
TYPEAHEAD|NOTYPEAHEAD
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Both the TYPEAHEAD and NOTYPEAHEAD options are valid only when
                you logon through the PDP-11 terminal controller (that is,
                using class code 20).  TYPEAHEAD, the logon default, allows
                you to enter text before a prompt is sent to the terminal.
                Thus, you can enter text in collect mode without waiting for
                the line-number prompt.  NOTYPEAHEAD specifies that any
                characters you type before the prompt appears should be
                ignored.

.* OPTION VFAST,NOVFAST
.optix VFAST
.optix NOVFAST
VFAST|NOVFAST\\\VFAST lets you jump ahead through several screens in a full
                screen application like Page WYLBUR or Prism.  For example,
                pressing the Next Page (F5 or ESC N) key twice quickly in Page
                WYLBUR displays the screen two screens ahead without first
                displaying the intervening screen.  SET TERMINAL NOVFAST turns
                this off.  SET TERMINAL VFAST is the default.

.* OPTION QUIET,NOQUIET
.optix QUIET
.optix NOQUIET
QUIET|NOQUIET\\\suppresses all output to the terminal; any attempt to read or
                write to the terminal results in the session being logged off.
                The exception is the LIST or POINT commands, WRITE statement,
                or the INPUT function to the session that use the FORCE
                option.  This is an advanced option for special server
                applications.

.* OPTION TRACE,NOTRACE
.optix TRACE
.optix NOTRACE
TRACE|NOTRACE\\\TRACE turns on tracing, which is a log of the terminal session
                (both terminal input and output).  The trace information can
                be examined from another session with the SHOW LTRACE command.
                The message "(Tracing)" will appear on the SHOW LINE response.
                Up to 100 lines will be kept in the trace log at one time;
                as more lines go in, the older ones are discarded.  The default
                is NOTRACE.  Tracing can be turned off at any time with this
                option.  This feature is generally used to provide information
                from a server session.

.* OPTION KEEP,NOKEEP
.optix KEEP
.optix NOKEEP
KEEP|NOKEEP\\\\\KEEP means the session's trace log (see SET TERMINAL TRACE)
                will be kept and not discarded after the session ends.  This
                is especially useful when the session is a server session.
                Only 25 sessions can be kept at one time, so you should fetch
                the session trace as quickly as possible once the session ends.
                Like TRACE to which it relates, this is an advanced option,
                primarily meant for special server applications.
