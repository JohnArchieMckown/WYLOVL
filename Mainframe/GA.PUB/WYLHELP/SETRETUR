SET RETURN [line-number]

.* DESCRIPTION
The SET RETURN command allows you to set the value of the symbolic line number
RETURN to the specified line number.  SET RETURN is used in EXEC files, as an
alternative to EXECUTE SAVE, to tell WYLBUR to return to the point of
invocation without specifying an actual line number in the file.  (Type HELP
RETURN for a description of RETURN.)\

If you issue the SET RETURN command without a line number, RETURN is set to
its default value of zero (0).  The SHOW RETURN command displays the current
value of RETURN.
