.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW XMONITOR command displays the monitor data from the EXEC file
monitor.  Type HELP MONITOR for information on using the monitor.

SHOW XMONITOR alone shows a summary of the CPU usage for an EXEC.  The summary
is listed by line number and exec file, and includes the total CPU time for
each line number and the number of times the command was executed.

The monitor information will not be correct for non-Extended EXECs that
execute other non-Extended EXECs.
