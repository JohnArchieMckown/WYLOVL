The Wylbur TSO command starts a session with the IBM timesharing
system.  It is a shorthand form for the command:

         VLOGON TSO

The VLOGON command allows a Wylbur user to start a session with any
program that accepts SNA connections (such as TSO and CICS).  For
more information about the VLOGON command, type:

         HELP VLOGON
         HELP VISTA

This is currently an experimental facility, and is subject to change
without notice.
