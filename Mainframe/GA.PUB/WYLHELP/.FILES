.chapter 'WYLBUR Files'
.ix files
When you enter text or data with WYLBUR, you use WYLBUR files.  A WYLBUR file
is simply a collection of lines arranged in ascending order by line number.  A
file can contain a program such as FORTRAN or PL/I, some text such as a memo
or a manual, or even a series of WYLBUR commands.  Each line in a file may
contain from 0 to 235 characters; WYLBUR assigns a unique number from 0 to
99999.999 to each line.  Line numbers can have up to 3 digits to the right of
the decimal point.
.section 'Active, External, and EXEC Files'
.ix files active
.ix 'active file'
Each of the three types of WYLBUR files, the active, the external, and the
EXEC file, has unique attributes.
.subsection 'Active File'
The active file is a temporary file that WYLBUR holds in the computer's memory
so that you can make additions and alterations to it.  The maximum workable
size of the active file is about 100,000 lines of average length of 65
characters.  Most editing commands (see Chapter 4) operate only on the active
file.

.ix 'active file' multiple
.ix files active multiple
.ix 'multiple active files'
You can have several active files during one session.  Although only one
active file is current at any one time, you can move and copy text between
active files and display more than one active file on the screen using Page
mode.

To make a permanent copy of your active file, you must store it on a disk
volume (an external storage device) by issuing a SAVE command.  (See Part II
for a description of the the SAVE command.)\ Once a file is stored on a disk
volume, it becomes a permanent, external file (also called a data set).
.subsection 'External File'
.ix files external
.ix 'data set'
.ix 'external file'
External files are either sequential data sets or partitioned data sets,
defined by how they use space.  Each sequential data set takes up a minimum of
one track of space on a disk volume, no matter how many lines of text or data
you actually include in that data set.  (Currently one track is approximately
47,000 characters on a 3380 disk; about 700 lines or 14 textbook pages.)\ A
partitioned data set (also called a library) is usually assigned several
tracks of space; however, it uses space more efficiently than a sequential
data set.  (See Part II, Library, for a description of libraries.)\ Section
2.3 includes guidelines on whether to use sequential or partitioned data sets.
Both sequential and partitioned data sets are identified by a data set name
(dsname) that must follow certain conventions.  (See Part II, Dsname, for a
description of dsname.)\
.subsection 'EXEC File'
.ix files EXEC
.ix 'EXEC file'
An EXEC file contains WYLBUR commands that WYLBUR executes sequentially
(unless you specify otherwise).  You can include any WYLBUR command in the
EXEC file, although it can only contain about 1500 lines or 20 pages.  (See
Part II, SHOW PAGES Command, for a description of pages.)\ An external or
active file becomes an EXEC file when you issue the EXECUTE command.  WYLBUR
moves the commands in the active or external file into the EXEC file space (a
part of the computer's memory) and then executes those commands.  (See Part II
for a description of the EXECUTE command.)\ WYLBUR holds the EXEC file in
memory (just as it holds the active file); you can work with it and the active
file at the same time.

Prepackaged EXEC files are available to help you perform a variety of useful
tasks, such as copying a file from disk to tape.  Appendix C describes the
most frequently-used EXEC files.  You can type HELP EXEC FILES to get this
information online.
.section 'Active File Recovery'
.ix 'active file' recovery
.ix files active recovery
WYLBUR recovers your current active file whenever the operating system or
WYLBUR fails, or the communication connection is broken.  Recovery means that
WYLBUR saves and catalogs the active file with the data set name,
WYL.gg.uuu.ACTIVE (gg.uuu is your ITS account), and restores it as your active
file, the next time you logon.  You should not save any data sets with the
name ACTIVE, since WYLBUR replaces the old data set named ACTIVE whenever it
performs recovery.

Warning:  WYLBUR cannot recover your active file in the following situations.
.point begin
When you reach or exceed your space limit (the maximum amount of disk storage
permitted for your account).  Whenever recovery becomes impossible for that
reason, WYLBUR issues a warning message at logon that recovery is blocked.
(Contact ITS Account Services in Forsythe Hall to change the space limit for
your account.)\
.point
When you logon to an account that allows multiple logons and someone else is
logged on to it.  If so, WYLBUR issues a warning message that recovery is not
possible and asks if you want to continue the logon procedure.  (See Section
1.4.1 for more information about accounts that allow multiple logons.)\
.point
When certain types of hardware failures occur (such as the failure of the
storage devices that hold active files).  This type of hardware failure occurs
infrequently.
.point end
.section 'Managing Data Sets'
Because you are charged for your disk space, managing it well allows you to
save more data sets without incurring unnecessary disk storage charges.  You
can save your active file on a disk volume as a sequential data set or as a
member of a partitioned data set (library).  (See Section 2.1.2 for an
explanation of the difference between a sequential data set and a library.)\
The size of your file is an important criterion for choosing between the two
types of data sets.  An active file of less than 300 lines should probably be
saved in a library.  (See the ALLOCATE command in Part II for information on
how to set up a library.)\

You can keep track of the names of your data sets with the SHOW CATALOG
command; you can use the SHOW DSNAMES command to find out the sizes of those
data sets.  To find out the total amount of space (in tracks) that your
account uses, issue the SHOW SPACE command.  (See Part II for descriptions of
the SHOW CATALOG, the SHOW DSNAMES, and the SHOW SPACE commands.)\
