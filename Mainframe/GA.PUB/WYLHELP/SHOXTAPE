.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW XTAPE command displays tape information kept in the TLMS (Tape
Library Management System) and if specified, also in the Auto-Scratch/TOSS
(Tape Off-Site Storage) data bases.  SHOW XTAPE displays the following basic
information:

   - tape owner
   - first data set name
   - number of files on the tape
   - job name
   - programmer name
   - creation date and date last accessed
   - keep date
   - input use code
   - output use code
   - location code

The AUTOSCRATCH option on the SHOW XTAPE command displays the Auto-Scratch/TOSS
information.  The ALL option on the SHOW XTAPE command displays more
information, including a description of the tape's location code.

* C U R R E N T  R E S T R I C T I O N S *
As of 04/17/88, the restrictions of this command are:
   - Only Auto-Scratch/TOSS tape information for either the logged on account
     or any tape that you have read access can be displayed.
   - Any collect options will be ignored; therefore you cannot collect any
     tape information displayed into your active file.
   - There is no INTERNAL format defined yet.

You can issue the SHOW XTAPE command for any tape that belongs to:

   - your account
   - another account with the same group code as your own
   - any account, if you specify the account on the SET XTAPE command
     and supply the password when prompted

As with other WYLBUR SHOW commands, you can use the DUMP XTAPE command to put
this information in the active file.  (Type HELP DUMP for a description of the
DUMP command.)\
