.* DESCRIPTION
The SET MODES command allows you to set various options related to editing
commands.  These options remain in effect only for the current session; each
time you logon they must be reset unless you want the defaults as indicated
below in the option descriptions for SET MODES.

The SHOW MODES command displays the current MODE options in effect, including
the current number of changes.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION SHORT,NOSHORT
.optix SHORT
.optix NOSHORT
SHORT|NOSHORT\\\SHORT allows the "short forms" of the DELETE, INSERT, and
                REPLACE commands to be accepted without warning.  The "short
                forms" (not to be confused with abbreviations) are expressed
                as:

                   line-number [text]

                If the line number specified already exists in the active
                file, the line is deleted (if no text is given) or replaced
                (if text is given).  If the line number does not already
                exist, a line with the specified text is inserted.  When
                NOSHORT, the default, is in effect, WYLBUR accepts those
                "short forms" only after a permission prompt.  When responding
                YES or OK to the permission prompt, you can also specify list
                options.  (Type HELP LIST-OPTIONS for a description of the
                list options.)\

.* OPTION ATTN,NOATTN
.optix ATTN
.optix NOATTN
ATTN|NOATTN\\\\\ATTN causes pressing BREAK as the only response
                to a Command> prompt to be treated as though you entered
                COLLECT with no options.  When NOATTN is in effect,
                pressing BREAK as the only response to a Command>
                prompt simply reissues the Command> prompt.

.* OPTION RETRY,NORETRY
.optix RETRY
.optix NORETRY
.ix '@(RETURN)'
RETRY|NORETRY\\\regulate whether automatic command retry mode is in effect.
                RETRY allows you to enter automatic command retry mode.  This
                means that whenever a WYLBUR command fails to execute (e.g.,
                due to a syntax error), WYLBUR will prompt you to modify the
                command so that it can be resubmitted for execution.  Retry
                may also be invoked for commands that executed satisfactorily
                by pressing the RETURN key (only) in response to the Command>
                prompt.  NORETRY is the default.  Even in NORETRY mode it is
                possible to invoke command retry by typing @ and then pressing
                the RETURN key in response to the Command> prompt, or by
                typing @ followed by the beginning of a previously-typed
                command.  Type HELP SHOW HISTORY for more details.

.* OPTION MODIFY,EDIT
.optix MODIFY
.optix EDIT
MODIFY|EDIT\\\\\is specified with the RETRY option to indicate whether you
                want to be prompted with "Mods\\>\" or "Edits\>\\" in command
                retry mode.  MODIFY is the default.  (Type HELP MODIFY or HELP
                EDIT for more information about the MODIFY and EDIT
                commands.)\

.* OPTION LIST,NOLIST
.optix LIST
.optix NOLIST
LIST|NOLIST\\\\\changes the default display option for some commands.  LIST
                mode causes LIST to be the default for DELETE, INSERT,
                REPLACE, COLLECT, JOIN, and EXCHANGE.  Note that COPY and MOVE
                still default to NOLIST.  The CHANGE, LIST, POINT, EDIT, and
                MODIFY commands always default to LIST and are not affected by
                SET MODES NOLIST.

.* OPTION CLEAR,CLR,NOCLEAR,NOCLR
.optix CLEAR
.optix NOCLEAR
CLEAR|NOCLEAR\\\CLEAR allows WYLBUR to automatically clear the active file on
                certain commands (e.g., USE, FETCH, LOGOFF), if you have not
                made any changes to your active file since issuing a command
                that sets your change count to zero (e.g., USE, SAVE, MAIL).
                NOCLEAR, the default, specifies that you will be warned if you
                try to access another data set or logoff before clearing your
                active file.

.* OPTION WARN,NOWARN
.optix WARN
.optix NOWARN
WARN=n|NOWARN\\\If n or more changes have been made to your active file since
                you issued a command that sets your change count to zero
                (e.g., USE, SAVE, MAIL), WYLBUR will warn you if you try to
                clear the active file.  WARN=30 is the default at logon.  The
                number of typed additions, deletions, replacements, or changes
                made to the active file is recorded by WYLBUR as the "change"
                count.  If the value of the change count is equal to or
                greater than the warn count, WYLBUR issues the messages:

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<number> typed changes to your ACTIVE file.
                   Clear ACTIVE (Yes/No)?

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\A reply of YES or OK clears the active file; otherwise, the
                CLEAR command is aborted.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\If NOWARN is in effect and the WARN option is specified on a
                given command, WARN overrides NOWARN mode for that command
                only.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\NOWARN turns off WARN mode.  If WARN mode is in effect and the
                NOWARN option is specified on a given command, NOWARN
                overrides WARN mode for that command only.
