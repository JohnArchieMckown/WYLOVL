.* DESCRIPTION
The MAIL command allows you to send messages from your active file to users
who have a mailbox, or to users of other systems that are on the SUNet
or Internet networks.

To display mail that you have received, use the SHOW MAIL command.  Type HELP
SHOW MAIL for details.  To receive mail, you must have a mailbox.  Type SHOW
MAIL STATUS to see if your account can receive mail.  If it cannot, type the
SET MAIL command.  Type HELP SET MAIL for details.

When sending a message to a Data Center user with the MAIL command, you
receive a system message like the following:

   Mail sent to Willie Nelson <N2.F84> (User notified)

It will include the "User notified" portion if the recipient is logged-on.
WYLBUR sends and stores the message whether or not the recipient is logged on.
In addition, WYLBUR sends a system message to the terminal of any logged-on
recipient indicating that mail has been sent.

To send mail to a user on SUNet or the Internet, include the user's user-id
on their own machine and the machine's host-id.  For example:

   Command> mail to u.user@lear

Type HELP HOSTS for a list of host-ids.

Note that once you issue a MAIL command, your "change" count is reset to zero.
(Your change count is the number of editing changes made to your active file.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\is a standard WYLBUR line range.  If no range is specified,
                the entire active file is sent.  (Type HELP RANGE for a
                description of range.)\

.* OPTION EXECUTE
.optix EXECUTE
EXECUTE\\\\\\\\\specifies that the EXEC file be mailed.  If this option is not
                specified, the active file will be sent.  (Type HELP EXECUTE
                for a description of the EXEC file.)\

.* OPTION NAME
.optix NAME
NAME='name'\\\\\specifies a name that will appear in the system message sent
                to the recipient, both when the mail is actually displayed and
                in the SHOW MAIL SUMMARY response.  The name must be enclosed
                in apostrophes (i.e., MAIL NAME='WILLIE NELSON' TO E1.ABC).
                If this option is not included, the name displayed will be
                that specified by the SET NAME command.

.* OPTION TO,UUU,GG.UUU,ACCOUNT,ACCT,USER-ID,HOST-ID,DISTLIST
.optix TO
TO\{userid|uuu|gg.uuu|user@host-id|distlist|(...,...,...)}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\userid is the Forsythe userid to whom the mail is to be sent.
                uuu specifies that the mail is to be sent to that user in the
                logged-on user's group.  gg.uuu specifies that the mail is to
                be sent to the account specified.  user-id@host-id specifies
                that the mail is to be sent to an account on a network system.
                distlist specifies an EMS public distribution list, which may
                contain multiple addresses.  (Use EMS ADMIN to search for,
                examine, add or update a list; use the WHO command to see the
                members of a specific list.)  Multiple addresses are allowed
                when separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses.

.* OPTION TITLE,SUBJECT
.optix SUBJECT
SUBJECT='subject'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\is the subject (title) of the mail being sent.  The subject
                must be enclosed in apostrophes (for example, MAIL TO E1.ABC
                SUBJECT='Class Schedule').  It will be included in system
                messages sent to the recipient, both when the mail is actually
                displayed, and in the SHOW MAIL SUMMARY response.  The word
                TITLE may be used in place of SUBJECT.

.* OPTION NONOTIFY
.optix NONOTIFY
NONOTIFY\\\\\\\\is a WYLBUR option that suppresses the MAIL notification
                message that a logged-on recipient receives when mail is sent.

.* OPTION SILENT
.optix SILENT
SILENT\\\\\\\\\\requests that status messages are not sent to your terminal
                for mail sent via BITNET.  Some systems may not honor your
                requests to suppress notification messages and may send them
                anyway.)\

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\is a standard WYLBUR option that suppresses the system
                response to the sender if the command is successful.

.* OPTION DRYRUN
.optix DRYRUN
DRYRUN\\\\\\\\\\does all the work of the MAIL command except to actually send
                the mail.  You will get a message like "Mail would have been
                sent to George Meade <US.GSM>" indicating to whom the mail
                would have been sent.  This is useful primarily for testing
                when you don't want to actually clutter up a mailbox with
                messages.
