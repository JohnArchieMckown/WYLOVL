.* DESCRIPTION
The READ statement is designed to be used in an EXEC file to obtain commands
or values of variables from the active file, EXEC file or the terminal that
will be used during the execution of the EXEC file.

.* SELECT 'READ Statement Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION UPPER,UPLOW
.optix UPPER
.optix UPLOW
UPPER|UPLOW\\\\\overrides the session case setting.  UPLOW causes information
                obtained by the READ statement to be retained in its original
                case.  UPPER causes information obtained by the READ statement
                to be converted to uppercase.  (Type HELP SET TERMINAL CASE
                for a further description of case settings.)\

.* OPTION STRING
.optix STRING
STRING\variable
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\stores a string passed from the terminal, the active file, or
                the EXEC file in the specified string variable.  The string
                does not have to be enclosed in quotation marks or
                apostrophes, unless they are considered part of the string.
                The USING option must be included to assign a string from the
                active file, and both the USING and EXECUTE options must be
                used to assign a string from the EXEC file.  If the USING
                option is not specified, WYLBUR prompts for the string at the
                terminal.

.* OPTION VALUE
.optix VALUE
VALUE\list\of\variables
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\stores values passed from the terminal, the active file, or
                the EXEC file to the specified predefined variables.  You can
                assign as many as eight variables; however, multiple values
                must be separated by commas or blanks.  WYLBUR evaluates any
                expression(s) before assigning it to a variable.  String
                values must be enclosed in quotation marks or apostrophes.
                The USING option must be specified to assign a value from the
                active file, and both the USING and EXECUTE options must be
                specified to assign a value from the EXEC file.  If the USING
                option is not specified, WYLBUR prompts for the value at the
                terminal.  Usage notes: READ VALUE may be used only in old-
                style EXECs. Only old-style variables (S0-S9, N0-N9, W0-W9)
                may be used.  READ VALUE cannot be executed as a command
                outside of an EXEC file.

.* OPTION PROMPT
.optix PROMPT
PROMPT='string'\specifies a prompt that WYLBUR displays at the terminal
                instead of the default "Enter>" prompt.  The length of the
                prompt is limited only by the maximum command length of 235
                characters.  For example, the command:

                   READ PROMPT='ENTER USE COMMAND:\\'

                causes WYLBUR to display the prompt,

                   ENTER USE COMMAND:\\

                at the terminal.  You respond with a USE command that WYLBUR
                executes before continuing execution of the EXEC file.

.* OPTION USING,LINE-NUMBER
.optix USING
[USING=]line-number
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the line in the active file that includes the
                information to be passed to the EXEC file.  Only one line
                number can be indicated.  If the EXECUTE option is included
                with USING, the information is taken from a line number in the
                EXEC file.  If the USING option is omitted, WYLBUR prompts for
                the information at the terminal.

.* OPTION COLUMNS,COLS
.optix COLUMNS
COLUMNS=m[/n]\\\specifies that WYLBUR is to read the contents of the columns
                in the given line number.  If you include both beginning and
                ending columns, they must be separated by a slash (e.g., 2/5).
                If you omit the ending column (/n), it is assumed to be the
                last non-blank character of the text line.

.* OPTION DELETE
.optix DELETE
DELETE\\\\\\\\\\specifies that after obtaining the contents of the specified
                line, WYLBUR should delete that line from the active file.
                Note that this option is cannot be used with the EXECUTE
                option.

.* OPTION EXECUTE
.optix EXECUTE
EXECUTE\\\\\\\\\indicates that WYLBUR should get the information from a line
                in the EXEC file rather than the active file.

.* OPTION NOMODEL,TRANSPARENT
.optix NOMODEL
.optix TRANSPARENT
NOMODEL|TRANSPARENT
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\NOMODEL specifies that the data to be read should not be
                interpreted as containing model terminal sequences.  This is
                useful when the data contains escape sequences.  TRANSPARENT
                specifies that the data to be read should be treated as
                straight binary data (without being translated to text).

.* OPTION ATTN
.optix ATTN
ATTN=line-number
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies a line number that WYLBUR is to execute next, if the
                BREAK key is pressed in response to the prompt from the READ
                statement.  Symbolic line numbers are acceptable.  When the
                ATTN option is not used, pressing BREAK in response to the
                READ prompt causes an EXEC BREAK.  To cause an EXEC BREAK when
                using the ATTN option on the READ statement, you must respond
                to the READ prompt by typing a question mark (?) and pressing
                BREAK.
