This manual describes WYLBUR, a computer program that is part of the
Stanford Data Center computer at Information Technology Services (ITS) at
Stanford.  WYLBUR acts as a text editor and a communicator with
other parts of the system.

Since this is primarily a reference manual, it provides a description
of each WYLBUR command, including details about syntax, function,
and options.  Definitions of essential system terminology are also
included.  Part I gives a brief overview of WYLBUR; Part II contains
command descriptions and definitions of terminology taken from
WYLBUR's online HELP facility.

Note that Page WYLBUR, a recent extension to WYLBUR (as of January
1984), is only briefly described in this document, in the command
descriptions of VIEW, SET VIEW, SHOW VIEW, and SET TERMINAL.  Page
WYLBUR allows full screen (or page mode) editing; the type of editing
provided by text editors on microcomputers.  The WYLBUR
User's Guide and the Page WYLBUR Reference Card explain how to use
Page WYLBUR.

This manual is intended for current WYLBUR users who want a review
of WYLBUR or who are interested in increasing their knowledge of the
program.  Those with no knowledge of WYLBUR should begin with
.italic 'WYLBUR Overview'
or the
.italic 'WYLBUR User's Guide'
(described in OTHER DOCUMENTATION).
