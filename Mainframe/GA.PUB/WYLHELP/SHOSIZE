.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW SIZE command displays the number of characters in each line of a
specified range.

.* SELECT 'SHOW SIZE Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION LINES,LINS,RANGE
.optix LINES
[LINES=]range\\\is the range of lines to be examined.  The default range is
                the entire file.  If this option is specified as LINES=range,
                it may appear anywhere; however, if it is specified as range
                alone, it must be given first.  (Type HELP RANGE for a
                description of range.)\

.* OPTION OVER,UNDER,EQUAL
.optix OVER
.optix UNDER
.optix EQUAL
[[OVER\{n|LENGTH}]\[UNDER\{n|LENGTH}]|EQUAL\{n|LENGTH}]
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\indicates a limiting value for the number of characters in
                each line of the specified range, where n may be any integer
                from 0 to 235.  LENGTH specifies that the current value of the
                global LENGTH (see SET LENGTH) be used.  OVER will list line
                numbers and counts for lines longer than n or LENGTH; UNDER
                for lines less than n or LENGTH; and EQUAL for lines equal to
                n or LENGTH.  When the OVER or UNDER option is specified and
                no lines are found meeting the specified conditions, either
                the length of the longest or shortest line encountered will be
                reported.  For example:

                   Command> show size over 30
                   No lines over 30, longest was 23
                   Command> show size under 20
                   No lines under 20, shortest was 21

                In addition, the OVER and UNDER options can be combined in one
                command to process only lines that are between the two lengths
                specified.  For example, OVER 72 UNDER 80 will list lines that
                are 73 to 79 characters long.  If none of these options is
                specified, all line numbers and their character count are
                listed.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the SHOW SIZE
                command into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for
                a description of these options.
