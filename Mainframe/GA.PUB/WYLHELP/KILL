KILL {gg.uuu|uuu|line-number}
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The KILL command terminates the logged-on session for the named account or for
the given MILTEN line number.

When you issue the command, WYLBUR will show a line of information about the
session (the same that you'd see from the SHOW LINE command), and ask you to
either confirm that the session should be ended (if the account is the same as
the one for your current session) or ask you for the password to the account,
if it is different from the one for your current session.

For example, if you are logged on to account HE.LLO and want to logoff a
session belonging to account BY.BYE, your session would look like this:

  Command> kill by.bye
  This session will be logged off:
    23 BY.BYE   Bethena Exeunt       TESTWYL  ALF1-DHC02
  Account BY.BYE is not yours.
  Password?

When you enter the current password, the BY.BYE session will be logged off.

If you are logged on to a session but the same account is already logged on to
another session (using SET AUTO MULTIPLE), you can eliminate that first session
(or vice versa) with the KILL command.  Since it is your account, WYLBUR does
not ask you to provide the password but does ask you to comfirm that it's ok.

  TESTWYL> kill he.llo
  This session will be logged off:
   658 HE.LLO   Leland Orevoir       TESTWYL  ALF3-DHC19
  OK (Yes/No)? yes
  Line 658 HE.LLO will be logged off.
  TESTWYL>

In either case, a message is sent from the operator to the session just before
it is logged off, identifying the account number of the person who issued the
KILL command.

You can't use the KILL command to terminate your current session; use LOGOFF
instead.
