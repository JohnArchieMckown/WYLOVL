                is in effect.  (Type HELP SET MODES LIST for a description of
                SET MODES LIST.)\ LIST causes WYLBUR to display the lines as
                it exchanges them.  For a description of all the list options,
                type HELP LIST-OPTIONS.

                change and to issue a permission prompt "Exchange (Yes/No)?".
                You can make the following responses:

                   YES, Y, OK  -- exchange the lines
                   NO, N       -- don't exchange the lines

                If you press the BREAK key, WYLBUR aborts the command.
