.* DESCRIPTION
The POINT command functions exactly as the LIST command except that it updates
the pointer to the CURRENT line as it lists a line.  (Type HELP CURRENT for a
description of CURRENT.)\

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the range of lines to be listed.  If a range is not
                specified, the entire active file will listed.  If this option
                is used, it must be specified first.  Type HELP RANGE for a
                description of range.

.* OPTION EXECUTE
.optix EXECUTE
EXECUTE\\\\\\\\\specifies that all or part of the EXEC file is to be listed.
                The default is that the active file is to be listed.  If used
                in an EXEC file, it constitutes a branch.

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\LIST, the default for this command, lists the text and line
                numbers of the specified range.  If the NOLIST option is
                specified, the POINT command can be used to set the value of
                CURRENT without listing any lines.  For a description of all
                the list-options type HELP LIST-OPTIONS.

.* OPTION HEX,MIXED
.optix HEX
.optix MIXED
HEX|MIXED\\\\\\\HEX specifies that the listing be in hexadecimal
                representation.  MIXED causes all nonprinting (control)
                characters to be displayed in their EBCDIC hexadecimal format,
                enclosed in angle brackets.  For example, <270C> represents
                the two characters X'27' and X'0C'.

.* OPTION UNFORMATTED
.optix UNFORMATTED
UNFORMATTED\\\\\prints any WYLBUR formatting instructions, such as those for
                italic or underlined text, instead of executing them.  The
                The default is formatted, in which case any bold, italic, or
                underlining specified shows up on the terminal screen.

.* OPTION CC,MC
.optix CC
.optix MC
CC|MC\\\\\\\\\\\CC or MC causes the character in column 1 of each line in the
                range to be treated as a printer control character.  MC is
                valid only for files with machine control (MC) characters such
                as those normally created by some of the IBM assemblers or
                compilers.

.* OPTION COLUMNS,COLS
.optix COLUMNS
COLUMNS=m[/n]\\\restricts the listing to the columns specified.  If only m
                is specified, columns n through 235 are used.  Otherwise, the
                entire line is used.

.* OPTION MARKER
.optix MARKER
MARKER=c\\\\\\\\causes the listing to be suspended at any line that has the
                marker character in column 1.  The marker character (c) can be
                any character, although if it is one of the following it must
                be enclosed in quotation marks or apostrophes:

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\)\(\"\'\=\,\;\blank

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Listing is restarted by pressing the RETURN key.  The line
                containing the marker character is not listed, but a blank
                line will occur because of the carriage return needed to
                restart the listing.  A blank line may be inserted as a marker
                in a line range.  If a blank line is used, the MARKER
                character must be specified as a blank ' '.

.* OPTION INDENT
.optix INDENT
INDENT=n\\\\\\\\inserts n blanks at the left of each line listed.

.* OPTION DOUBLE,TRIPLE
.optix DOUBLE
.optix TRIPLE
DOUBLE|TRIPLE\\\produce a listing with double or triple spacing, respectively.
                Single spacing is the default.

.* OPTION SQUASHED
.optix SQUASHED
SQUASHED\\\\\\\\squashes all multiple blanks to single blanks before listing
                the line.  The active file is not changed.  This option is
                very useful when looking at fetched output since listing lines
                containing many blanks is very slow at a terminal.

.* OPTION NONL
.optix NONL
NONL\\\\\\\\\\\\suppresses the automatic insertion of the NL (New line or
                carriage return) character in text being listed at the
                terminal.  It is particularly well suited for online plotting
                at the terminal.  However, use of NONL requires that an NL
                (X'15') be included in the text stream wherever a new line is
                to occur.

.* OPTION NOMODEL
.optix NOMODEL
NOMODEL\\\\\\\\\specifies that the data to be written should not be
                interpreted as containing model terminal sequences.  This is
                useful when the data contains escape sequences.

.* OPTION NOPAUSE
.optix NOPAUSE
NOPAUSE\\\\\\\\\lists the message without any page pauses.  Page pauses
                normally occur when WYLBUR lists the number of lines specified
                in the SET TERMINAL HEIGHT command.  This is useful for EXEC
                files.

.* OPTION CLEAN
.optix CLEAN
CLEAN\\\\\\\\\\\will prevent messages from other terminals from interrupting
                an online listing.  However, messages from the operator will
                interrupt.

.* OPTION FORCE
.optix FORCE
FORCE\\\\\\\\\\\lists output to the terminal even if SET TERMINAL QUIET is in
                effect for the session.  Type HELP SET TERMINAL QUIET for
                information.  (This option is used primarily in EXEC files.)\

.* OPTION CLEAN
.optix CLEAN
CLEAN\\\\\\\\\\\will prevent messages from other terminals from interrupting
                an online listing.  However, messages from the operator will
                interrupt.

.* OPTION ATTN
.optix ATTN
ATTN=line-number
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\allows you to specify the line number in the EXEC file at
                which to resume execution after interrupting a LIST operation
                from an EXEC file by pressing the BREAK key.  This option is
                only useful in EXEC files.
