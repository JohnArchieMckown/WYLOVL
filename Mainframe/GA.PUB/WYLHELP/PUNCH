.* DESCRIPTION
The PUNCH command produces punched card output of all or part of an active or
EXEC file.

.ix 'OPTIONS: line' 'with PUNCH Command'
If the lines in the range to be punched begin with "OPTIONS:", then the
remaining text in the lines can specify PUNCH options.  The OPTIONS:\line
itself does not get punched.  A sample OPTIONS:\line might be:
.'ix ';'

   \\\\1.\\\\ OPTIONS: NUMBERED COPIES=2; comments

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION RANGE
.optix range
range\\\\\\\\\\\is the range of lines in the active or EXEC file that is to be
                punched.  If not specified, the entire file will be punched.
                If specified, it must be the first option.  WYLBUR adds 11 to
                the number of lines to be punched and uses that as a limit for
                the number of cards punched for the job.

.* OPTION EXECUTE
.optix EXECUTE
EXECUTE\\\\\\\\\causes all or part of the current EXEC file to be punched.

.* OPTION FROM
.optix FROM
FROM\dsname\\\\\specifies an external data set to be submitted (instead of the
                active or EXEC file).

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME
.optix ON
ON\volume\\\\\\\indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ If
                this option is not specified, the volume set with the SET
                VOLUME command will be searched; if no volume is set, the
                system catalog, an index of data sets, will be searched for
                the data set name and volume location.  (All data sets are
                automatically cataloged when they are saved, unless you
                specify otherwise.)\

.* OPTION FORMAT-OPTIONS,EDIT,CARD,PRINT,LRECL,SEQFLD
.optix format-options
format-options\\allow you to specify the record length and the treatment of
                WYLBUR line numbers in the data set to be used.  Type HELP
                FORMAT-OPTIONS for a description of these options.

.* OPTION TO
.optix TO
TO\{uuu|gg.uuu}\uuu specifies that the punched output is to be sent to the bin
                of the user in the logged-on user's group.  gg.uuu specifies
                that the punched output is to be sent to the bin of the
                account indicated.

.* OPTION LIST
.optix LIST
LIST\\\\\\\\\\\\produces an offline listing of that part of the file that is
                punched.  NOLIST, the default, means that no listing of the
                punched file will be produced.

.* OPTION NUMBERED,RNUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix NUMBERED
.optix RNUMBERED
.optix UNNUMBERED
.optix INTEGER
NUMBERED|RNUMBERED|UNNUMBERED|INTEGER
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\NUMBERED causes WYLBUR line numbers to be punched in columns
                73-80 of the card, if those columns are blank.  If a line
                number greater than 9999.999 is used in the range being
                processed, the high-order digit will be truncated.  RNUMBERED
                allows WYLBUR to put line numbers in columns 73-80 even if it
                means replacing text originally in those columns.  UNNUMBERED
                specifies that the WYLBUR line numbers are not to be punched
                in columns 73-80 of the cards.  INTEGER has the same meaning
                as RNUMBERED, except that the line number is an 8-digit
                integer.  The numbering option for PUNCH defaults to the
                option set with the SET JOB command; UNNUMBERED is the default
                setting for new accounts.  Type HELP SET JOB NUMBERED
                UNNUMBERED for a description of UNNUMBERED and NUMBERED.

.* OPTION COLUMNS,COLS
.optix COLUMNS
COLUMNS=m[/n]\\\specifies the beginning (m) and ending columns (n) on a card
                image that are to be punched.  If this option is not
                specified, m is 1 and n is 80.

.* OPTION JOBNAME
.optix JOBNAME
JOBNAME=name\\\\specifies a 1-8 character string to replace the complete
                jobname generated by WYLBUR when the job is submitted for
                punching.  The ID and PREFIX options will be ignored if
                JOBNAME is specified.

.* OPTION PREFIX
.optix PREFIX
PREFIX=prefix\\\is a character string from 1 to 8 characters used to overlay
                the WYLBUR-generated jobname, character by character, from
                left to right.  This jobname has the form uuuggnnn, where uuu
                is the user code, gg is the group code and nnn is a
                WYLBUR-generated job number that is incremented each time a
                job is submitted.  This option is ignored if the JOBNAME
                option is also specified.

.* OPTION ID
.optix ID
ID={id|'id'}\\\\is a character string used to override the ggnnn portion of of
                the WYLBUR-generated jobname.  This jobname has the form
                uuuggnnn, where uuu is the user code, gg is the group code and
                nnn is a WYLBUR-generated job number that is incremented each
                time a job is submitted.  The quoted 'id' form replaces the
                string ggnnn.  The unquoted id form overlays the string ggnnn
                character for character from left to right.

.* OPTION HEADER
.optix HEADER
HEADER='header'\permits a title of up to 20 characters to be punched on the
                job header and trailer sheets of your output.

.* OPTION PRIORITY,P,PR,PRTY
.optix PRIORITY
PRIORITY=priority
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the priority at which the job is to be punched.
                Valid values, in order of increasing priority, are:  LOW,
                STANDARD, or URGENT.  They may be abbreviated to L, S, U.
                STANDARD priority is assumed if this option is not used.
                URGENT priority will incur higher charges.  See DOC#RATES

.* OPTION BLOCK
.optix BLOCK
BLOCK=block\\\\\specifies the time block when the job can be punched.  Valid
                time blocks are:  DAY, EVENING, NIGHT, WEEKEND and ANY.  They
                may be abbreviated to D, E, N, W and A.  ANY is the default.
                For the current time block schedule, see DOC#SCHEDULE PUBLIC.

.* OPTION DEST
.optix DEST
DEST=destination
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the destination for punching the output of the job.
                Valid destinations include:

                   LOCAL          Forsythe Hall
                   SELF           Forsythe Hall, self-service puncher
                   RMTn           Remote work station n

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\If this option is not specified, the destination set with the
                SET OUTPUT command is used.  Type HELP SET OUTPUT DEST for a
                description of how to set a permanent default destination.

.* OPTION BIN,B
.optix BIN
BIN=nnn\\\\\\\\\causes the output to be routed to bin nnn.  If not specified,
                the bin of the logged-on user is assumed.

.* OPTION COPIES
.optix COPIES
COPIES=n\\\\\\\\specifies the number of copies to be punched.  The default is
                1.  The maximum number is 99.

.* OPTION KEEP
.optix KEEP
KEEP\\\\\\\\\\\\returns a job to the system output queue after the job has
                punched, putting the kept output in output hold.  This option
                provides a backup for output that is difficult or costly to
                reproduce.  If a job is lost, the output can be released from
                output hold and repunched.  When KEEP is specified, output
                remains in output hold for 48 hours, then is purged
                automatically.  The time remaining in output hold is not
                decremented during WEEKEND hours.

.* OPTION HOLD,H
.optix HOLD
HOLD\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that the job is to be placed into output hold.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the PUNCH command
                into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for a
                description of these options.

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\requests that all system responses be suppressed if the PUNCH
                command is successful.
