.* DESCRIPTION
The UTIL command allows you execute a Public EXEC file.  UTIL is an alternate
form of the EXECUTE command, which has the syntax:

     EXECUTE FROM LIB#execfile PUBLIC [PARM=(parm)] CLEAR

For a list of the publicly available EXEC files, type the command

     SHOW DIRECTORY FOR LIB PUBLIC

For a description of the EXECUTE command, type HELP EXECUTE.

Note:  If you are in SPIRES, you must have WYLBUR set or EXEC files (and thus
the UTIL command) will not work.  Type EXPLAIN SET WYLBUR (while in SPIRES)
for more information on the SET WYLBUR command and its effects.
