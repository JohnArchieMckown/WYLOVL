.* DESCRIPTION
The CHANGE command is primarily used for character editing (as opposed to the
MODIFY command that is used for line editing).  It can be used to replace one
character string with another string or integer, to shift text, to insert new
characters, to combine partial lines, and many other tasks.  It is often the
simplest way to change a group of lines, especially if one character string is
to be replaced by another of a different length.  The following example
illustrates the most basic form of the CHANGE command:

     CHANGE 'frog' TO 'prince'

changes the character string 'frog' to the character string 'prince' in the
entire active file.  Note that, as in the example above, the character strings
must be enclosed in quotation marks or apostrophes.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION C
.optix C
C\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\allows you to match a character string regardless of the case
                (upper, lower, or a mixture of upper and lower).  When you use
                C'stringa', it does not matter whether SET TERMINAL UPLOW or
                SET TERMINAL UPPER is in effect.

.* OPTION STRINGA
'stringa'\\\\\\\is the character string to be changed.  It must be enclosed in
                quotation marks or apostrophes and it must contain at least
                one character (possibly blank).  That is, the null string is
                not permitted as a 'stringa' option on the CHANGE command.

.* OPTION X
.optix X
X'hexadecimal\string'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the text to be changed in its hexadecimal
                representation.  The text must be enclosed in quotation marks
                or apostrophes.

.* OPTION P,P/Q,P/Q/F,P//F,COLUMNS
p/q/f\\\\\\\\\\\p and q are column numbers of a line.  They restrict the
                search for 'stringa' in columns p through q.  f specifies a
                fence column to prevent any shifting of text in or to the
                right of that column.  Any blanks are shifted in or out before
                the fence column.  If any text is lost, a message is given.
                Specifying a fence column is useful when column-dependent text
                is being edited, as the CHANGE command normally shifts all of
                the line to the right of the change whenever characters are
                inserted or deleted.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\You may specify p, q and f in various combinations as follows:

.pa
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\p\\\\\\\'stringa' must begin in column p.  Text will be
                        shifted if characters are added or deleted.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\p/q\\\\\Columns p through q will be searched for the
                        occurrence of 'stringa'.  Text may be shifted.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\p/q/f\\\Columns p through q are searched and the fence column
                        is f.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\p//f\\\\'stringa' must begin in column p and the fence column
                        f.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\//f\\\\\p defaults to column 1 and q defaults to f-1.

.* OPTION (N),OCCURRENCE
(n)\\\\\\\\\\\\\is an occurrence count.  It restricts the replacement of
                'stringa' to the nth occurrence in each line of the range.  If
                omitted, every occurrence of 'stringa' is changed.

.* OPTION X,X/Y,X/Y/F,X//F,COLUMNS
x/y/f\\\\\\\\\\\x and y specify the beginning and ending columns,
                respectively, that are to be changed.  f specifies the fence
                column.  (See parameters p, q, f above).  You may specify x,
                y, and f in various combinations as follows:

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x\\\\\\\The replacement string will be inserted before column
                        x; text may be shifted.  E.g., CHANGE 1 TO '\' would
                        insert a blank before column 1, whereas CHANGE 1/1 TO
                        '\' would change column 1 to a blank.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x/y\\\\\Columns x through y will be changed; text may be
                        shifted if characters are deleted or inserted.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x/y/f\\\Columns x through y will be changed; f is the fence
                        column.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x//f\\\\The replacement string will be inserted before column
                        x; f is the fence column.

.* OPTION ALL
.optix ALL
ALL\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that all columns are to be changed.  This is
                equivalent to specifying 1/235 (since WYLBUR lines contain a
                maximum of 235 columns).

.* OPTION TO
.optix TO
TO\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies a string that is to replace 'stringa'.  The
                replacement string need not be of the same length as 'stringa'
                and it may consist of any number of alphabetic, numeric, or
                alphanumeric characters.  This option can take several forms
                indicated as follows:

.* OPTION STRINGB
'stringb'\\\\\\\specifies the replacement string.  It must be enclosed in
                quotation marks or apostrophes.  Three types of strings should
                be differentiated:

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\1.\alphabetic string.  For every occurrence of 'stringa' or
                      the specified columns, this type of string is directly
                      substituted.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\2.\alphanumeric string.  If an increment, n, is specified,
                      it is used as an edit pattern.  That is, the numeric
                      portion of this string is incremented or decremented
                      after each replacement.  If a number is the first
                      character in the string, it will not be incremented or
                      decremented.  The number should be the last character
                      in the string to be correctly incremented or decremented.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\3.\numeric string.  The string may optionally contain
                      leading zeros and blanks.  If it is to be used as an
                      edit pattern, the increment, n, must be specified.
                      Otherwise, the number remains constant with each use.

.* OPTION NUMBER,+NUMBER,-NUMBER
[+]number|-number
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies a positive or negative whole number to use as the
                replacement string.  The number should not be enclosed in
                quotes; it cannot contain leading blanks but it can contain
                leading zeros.  If a leading plus or minus sign is included,
                it will precede the number.  If you use no other +n or -n
                option (described below) the number will be incremented by
                one each occurrence in the range.


.* OPTION N,+N,-N
+n|-n\\\\\\\\\\\specifies a whole number to use as the associated increment
                (or decrement) when change text or columns to a number
                (described above.)  If the +n or -n is omitted from this
                form, +1 is assumed.

.* OPTION LINE
.optix LINE
LINE\\\\\\\\\\\\may be used when a positive or negative integer (see TO option
                above) is specified as a replacement string.  Normally a new
                incremented replacement string is calculated for each
                occurrence of 'stringa'.  This option specifies that all
                occurrences of 'stringa' in a single line are to be replaced
                by the same incremented replacement string.

.* OPTION X
.optix X
X'hexadecimal\string'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the replacement text in its hexadecimal
                representation.  The text must be enclosed in quotation marks
                or apostrophes.

.* OPTION UPPER,LOWER
.optix UPPER
.optix LOWER
UPPER|LOWER\\\\\UPPER specifies that the alphabetic text is to be changed to
                uppercase.  LOWER specifies that the alphabetic text is to be
                changed to lowercase.

.* OPTION USING
.optix USING
USING\s[/t]\\\\\This option is a way of designating that the replacement
                string is to be taken from another line(s) in the active file.
                s and t are the beginning and ending line numbers,
                respectively, of the replacement range.  s/t may be ALL to
                denote the entire active file.

.* OPTION COLUMNS,COLS
.optix COLUMNS
COLUMNS=v[/w]\\\v and w refer to the beginning and ending columns,
                respectively, of the replacement string in each line of the
                USING range.  If the string contained in columns v/w does not
                contain w-v+1 characters, the string will be blank filled on
                the right to contain that many characters.  If only v is
                specified, columns v through 235 (which may be null) are used.

.pa
.* OPTION LINE
.optix LINE
LINE\\\\\\\\\\\\Normally a new line is obtained for each occurrence of
                'stringa'.  This option specifies that all occurrences of
                'stringa' in a single line are to be replaced by the same
                USING range.

.* OPTION REPEAT
.optix REPEAT
REPEAT\\\\\\\\\\causes WYLBUR to repeat a USING replacement range as many
                times as necessary.

.* OPTION IN
.optix IN
IN\range\\\\\\\\specifies the range of lines to be searched for the occurrence
                of 'stringa'.  The entire file (the explicit range ALL) is the
                default for this option.

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\LIST, the default for this command, causes the changed lines
                to be displayed as they are changed.  Since interrupting the
                listing interrupts the change process, NOLIST is often used on
                this command when a large range of lines is changed.  For
                additional list-options, type HELP LIST-OPTIONS.

.* OPTION LENGTH-OPTIONS,LENGTH,NOLENGTH
.optix length-options
length-options\\provide an override for the global length message (established
                with the SET LENGTH command).  If you specify NOLENGTH, the
                warning message about excess length will not be issued (unless
                the line is over 235 characters).  Type HELP LENGTH-OPTIONS
                for a description of the length options.

.* OPTION MODIFY,M,EDIT,E,VERIFY
.optix MODIFY
.optix EDIT
.optix VERIFY
MODIFY|EDIT|VERIFY
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifying MODIFY or EDIT will allow you to MODIFY or EDIT the
                changed line.  If you press the BREAK key on the MODS or EDITS
                prompt, the line will not be changed.  VERIFY allows you to
                accept or reject each changed line in the specified range
                before it is placed into the active file.  WYLBUR displays the
                changed line and prompts you with
                "Change\(Yes/No/Modify/Edit)?".  You can make the following
                responses:

                   YES, Y, OK  -- accept the changes for the line
                   NO, N       -- rejects the changes for the line
                   MODIFY, M   -- switch into MODIFY to allow further changes
                   EDIT, E     -- switch into EDIT to allow further changes

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\If you press the BREAK key, the CHANGE command is aborted; but
                all changes made prior to the BREAK are retained.
