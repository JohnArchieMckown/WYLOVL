WHOIS name

The WHOIS command sends a request across the SUNet network to a personal name
server maintained by IR/Networking systems.  The "whois" directory is based on
information from the Faculty/Staff Directory and on student directories
maintained by the Registrar's Office.

The name can be a person's last name:

    Command>  whois smith

or some portion of a name (use "..." to match anything):

    Command>  whois benn...

or the person's "handle", a unique identifier for the person, usually the first
initial or initials followed by the last name (see below):

    Command>  whois absmith

The "name" may also be a University business phone number, making the command
work like a reverse directory.  (Be sure to include the hyphen.)

    Command> whois 3-4420

If there is more than one person with that name in the directory (as in Smith)
the server responds with the name, phone number, mail code, electronic mail
address and handle of each one.  For the complete display of information about
any of the people displayed, type WHOIS again, this time with that person's
handle, which you'll find in parentheses after the person's name.

When WHOIS finds only one record, the server responds with the complete display
of information for that person.

The WHOIS information is actually stored on another computer on SUNet.  If you
receive a message such as "Connection refused" when you try the WHOIS command,
it usually means that the other computer is not accepting requests or the link
between computers is not functioning.

Type HELP PHONE or HELP FINGER for information on related commands.
