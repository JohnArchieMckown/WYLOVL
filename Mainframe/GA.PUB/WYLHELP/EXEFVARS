EXEC File Variables

(Note: For help about system variables, type HELP SYSTEM VARIABLES.)

A WYLBUR variable is a temporary storage location for a quantity or a character
string.  WYLBUR variables, user and system, are used primarily in EXEC files.

There are three types of variables in the new WYLBUR EXEC file extensions:
number, string, and boolean (True/False).

Names:  Variable names may have up to 16 characters including numbers,
letters, and the underscore character (_).  The first character of the name
must be an alphabetic character.  Some names are reserved.  For example, S0 -
S9 are assumed to be string variables, to be compatible with current usage.
W0 - W9 are number variables, and like all number variables have extended
accuracy (instead of being limited to valid WYLBUR line numbers.)

Arrays:  You can also use arrays the new WYLBUR EXEC file support.  Arrays,
however, must always be declared before they are used, using the DECLARE
command.  Specify the variable type, the array name, and the array's maximum
dimension (in square brackets).

     DECLARE  NUMBER   name[num]
     DECLARE  STRING   name[num]
     DECLARE  BOOLEAN  name[num]

To see the contents of an array, type the SHOW ARRAY command:

    SHOW ARRAY array-name

The LIKE, FROM, and TO options help you specify which parts of the array to
display.

Declaring Variables:  You must always DECLARE an array.  Variables other than
arrays may also be declared.  If undeclared, the type is determined by the
first usage.

     DECLARE NUMBER  list-of-names (separated by spaces)
     DECLARE STRING  list-of-names (separated by spaces)
     DECLARE BOOLEAN list-of-names (separated by spaces)

A variable may be one of three types:  string, number, or boolean (True or
False).

To display the value of a variable, use the SHOW VALUE command (or SV)
followed by the variable name.  Type HELP SHOW VALUE for information.

To display all of your variables, use the SHOW VARS command.  Type HELP SHOW
VARS for details.

To clear your variables, use the CLEAR VARS command.  Type HELP CLEAR VARS for
more information.

Variable Scope:  variables can only be used within the procedure or EXEC file
that allocates them.  If you assign variable x and then XCALL an EXEC file,
the variable x is not assigned the the EXEC file.

One special kind of variable, an x-variable, is accessible to all of the PROCs
called by the XPROC in which it is declared.  If the XPROC calls another XPROC
or calls itself, however, the variable's value is not accessible.  These
variables must be declared and used with the X.  prefix.

             x.flag = TRUE
             flag = FALSE
             sv x.flag --> TRUE

Another special type of variables is session variables, which span an entire
session.  A session variable must be assigned and accessed with the SES.
prefix:

             ses.name = 'Stanford'
             name = 'Fred'
             sv ses.name  -->  'Stanford'
