.* DESCRIPTION
The COLLECT command allows you to create a new active file or to add new lines
to the current active file.  WYLBUR does not overwrite existing lines and
interleaves lines only when you specify the MERGE option.

.ix '(BREAK)'
.ix 'BREAK key'
.ix key BREAK
If you issue the SET MODES ATTN command, then pressing the BREAK key in
response to a command prompt effectively issues a COLLECT command (with no
options).  Type HELP SET MODES NOATTN for a description of the ATTN and NOATTN
modes.

WYLBUR remembers if you were collecting at the end of the active file.  If
another command adds lines to the end of the file and you resume collecting by
typing COLLECT without a line number, WYLBUR will start prompting at the new
end of the file.

If necessary to continue collecting, WYLBUR automatically renumbers (because
of an existing line) lines just collected WYLBUR does not actually renumber
the lines until you enter the next line.  Thus, if you do not want the lines
renumbered (or if you are finished collecting lines and you do not need the
renumbering), simply press the BREAK key (only) in response to the next line
number prompt.  Then WYLBUR keeps the original numbering.  WYLBUR
automatically renumbers only lines just collected; never lines before or after
those just collected).

.ix '@(BREAK)'
.ix 'command retry'
After collecting a line of text, you can type the @ sign and press the BREAK
key to MODIFY or EDIT that line.  MODIFY or EDIT is selected based on the mode
in effect.  (Type HELP SET MODES MODIFY EDIT for a description of the MODIFY
and EDIT modes.)\ Just typing @ and pressing the BREAK key as the only
response to the line number prompt allows you to MODIFY or EDIT the previous
line.  For example:

   Command> collect
   \\\\1.\\\> This is line one@***
   \\\\1.\\\\ This is line one
   \\\Mods\\>\\\\\\\\\ialtered
   \\\\1.\\\\ This is altered line one
   \\\\2.\\\> @***
   \\\\1.\\\\ This is altered line one
   \\\Mods\\>

.* SELECT 'COLLECT Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION LINE-NUMBER
.optix line-number
line-number\\\\\begins collecting the lines into the active file at the
                specified line number.  If this option is omitted, then
                collecting may begin at one of two points:

.pa
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\1.\If it is the first COLLECT after one of these commands
                      has been issued -- USE, CLEAR, ALIGN, JUSTIFY, or NUMBER
                      -- collecting will begin at END.  (Type HELP END for a
                      description of END.)\ In this case, WYLBUR does not use
                      the options from the previous COLLECT command.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\2.\Otherwise, collecting is a continuation of the last
                      COLLECT command and is resumed starting after the last
                      line collected.  In this case, the options from the
                      previous COLLECT are used, unless specifically
                      overridden.

                Remember, you can always specify COLLECT END explicitly.

.* OPTION BY
.optix BY
BY\increment\\\\specifies the line increment or delta to be used.  If the
                line-number option was specified, but BY was not, the default
                value is chosen according to the default delta rule.  Type
                HELP DELTA for a description of delta.

.* OPTION MERGE
.optix MERGE
MERGE\\\\\\\\\\\allows interleaving of collected lines with existing lines.
                Existing lines are never overwritten.  The interleaving will
                only occur if the increment is suitable.  For example, if the
                active file consists only of odd-numbered lines, the command
                COLLECT 2 BY 2 MERGE will result in prompts for even-numbered
                lines.

.* OPTION UPPER,UPLOW
.optix UPPER
.optix UPLOW
UPPER|UPLOW\\\\\when specified with COLLECT, UPPER or UPLOW provides a
                temporary override of the session case setting.  UPLOW causes
                WYLBUR to retain the case (upper, lower, or a mixture) of the
                text collected.  UPPER causes WYLBUR to convert all lowercase
                letters to uppercase as the text is collected.  (Type HELP
                SET TERMINAL CASE for a description of case settings.)\

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\NOLIST is the default for this command.  If LIST is specified,
                the line in the active file that precedes the next line to be
                collected will be listed.  (Type HELP LIST-OPTIONS for a
                description of the list-options.)\

.* OPTION LENGTH-OPTIONS,LENGTH,NOLENGTH
.optix length-options
length-options\\provide an override for the global length message (established
                with the SET LENGTH command).  If you specify NOLENGTH, the
                warning message about excess length will not be issued (unless
                the line is over 235 characters).  Type HELP LENGTH-OPTIONS
                for a description of the length options.

.* OPTION KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR
.optix KEEP
KEEP\\\\\\\\\\\\opens a new Active file without clearing the contents of the
                current one.  This is the same as answering KEEP to the
                "OK\to\Clear" prompt.  The PICK command lets you restore the
                previous active file.

.* OPTION CLEAR,CLR
.optix CLEAR
CLEAR\\\\\\\\\\\clears the current active file and opens a new one before the
                lines are collected.

.* OPTION NOWARN
.optix NOWARN
NOWARN\\\\\\\\\\when specified with the CLEAR option, overrides WARN mode, the
                logon default.  (Type HELP SET MODES WARN NOWARN for a
                description of the WARN and NOWARN modes.)\
