SET SAMSON [CRC|CHECKSUM|NONE] [PACKED|8BIT|7BIT|HEX] [BUFFER=n]
           [TIMEOUT=n|NOTIMEOUT] [TIME] [DEBUG|NODEBUG] [TRACE|NOTRACE]
           [TCLEAR]

.* DESCRIPTION
The SET SAMSON command lets you change certain parameters for your Samson file
transfer session.  Parameters include the error detection protocol, the data
encoding format, the timeout value and the buffer size.  The SET SAMSON
command only works with Samson version 3.0 or higher for the PC.

In general, Samson automatically determines the appropriate file transfers for
a particular connection, and it is best not to change them.  If you have a
particularly noisy line, you may want to decrease the packet size (with the
BUFFER option) or increase the timeout value (with the TIMEOUT option.) It is
possible to change these parameters such that file transfer will not work.

The SET SAMSON TIME command sets the time on the microcomputer to the same as
the time on the mainframe.  The time appears in the status line at the bottom
of the screen.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION CRC,CHECKSUM,NONE
.optix CRC
.optix CHECKSUM
.optix NONE
CRC|CHECKSUM|NONE
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the error detection protocol to use.  By default,
                version 3.0 and above of Samson use CRC, and earlier versions
                use CHECKSUM.  NONE turns off any error detection protocols.

.* OPTION PACKED,8BIT,7BIT,HEX
.optix PACKED
.optix 8BIT
.optix 7BIT
.optix HEX
PACKED|8BIT|7BIT|HEX
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the format in which the data will be encoded.  In
                general, Samson selects the correct format for the line you
                are using.  On lines that can transfer 8 bit data, the PACKED
                format compresses multiple blanks and therefore increases
                transmission speeds.  On Telenet connections and over modems
                that enforce parity, 7 bit data is the default.  It is best to
                let samson select the appropriate data encoding format.

.* OPTION BUFFER
.optix BUFFER
BUFFER=n\\\\\\\\the size of the Samson buffer in bytes.  n should be between
                128 and 1200, inclusive.  If a line is particularly noisy, you
                may want to decrease the buffer size; this will lengthen file
                transfer time but improve error detection and reliability.

.* OPTION TIMEOUT,NOTIMEOUT
.optix TIMEOUT
.optix NOTIMEOUT
TIMEOUT=n|NOTIMEOUT
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n is the amount of time that Samson will wait for a returning
                packet before timing out and resending.  If you are connecting
                via Telenet or with an MNP modem, you may need to either
                increase the timeout value or decrease the buffer size.  If
                so, try increasing it to twice the default value; any further
                increase will have no beneficial effect and may cause undue
                delays.

.* OPTION TIME
.optix TIME
TIME\\\\\\\\\\\\sets the time and date on the PC clock to the same as the Data
                Center's time and date displayed with the SHOW DATE.

.* OPTION DEBUG,NODEBUG
.optix DEBUG
.optix NODEBUG
DEBUG|NODEBUG\\\turns on the Samson debugging feature.  NODEBUG turns it off.

.* OPTION TRACE,NOTRACE
.optix TRACE
.optix NOTRACE
TRACE|NOTRACE\\\turns on the Samson trace facility, useful for debugging
                information.  NOTRACE turns it off.  SHOW SAMSON TRACE
                displays the trace table, and SET SAMSON TCLEAR clears the
                trace table.

.* OPTION TCLEAR
.optix TCLEAR
TCLEAR\\\\\\\\\\clears the contents of the trace table.  SET SAMSON TRACE
                turns on tracing.
