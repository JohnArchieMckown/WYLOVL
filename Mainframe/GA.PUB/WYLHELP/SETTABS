.* DESCRIPTION
The SET TABS command allows you to set logical tabs in WYLBUR whether or not
your terminal has physical tabs available.  (Check the instruction manual for
your terminal to see whether or not it has physical tabs and how to set them.)\

If your terminal does not have physical tabs, you can make use of WYLBUR's tab
capabilities by adding the NOVERIFY option to the SET TABS command.  NOVERIFY
suppresses the tab verification lines used to check physical tabs.  When you
are using tabs to enter text, the cursor (or carriage) will not move to the
proper location as you press the TAB key (it will move one space or not at
all).  However, WYLBUR does keep track of the tabs you have set, and when you
list the collected lines, WYLBUR inserts the multiple blanks as required,
unless you specify otherwise.  You must SET TERMINAL SLOW if the terminal does
not have tabs.  (Type HELP SET TERMINAL SLOW FAST for a description of the
SLOW and FAST terminal settings.)\

You must ensure that the physical tabs set on your terminal match the logical
tabs set in WYLBUR.  If you have a Gen-Com 300Q terminal, include the GENCOM
option on SET TERMINAL to set both physical and logical tabs.  If you have a
terminal that supports the automatic tab setting feature (such as a DECwriter
IV), include the AUTO option on SET TERMINAL to set both physical and logical
tabs.

Otherwise, consider the following alternatives for setting tabs.  First, set
the physical tabs where you want them, then set the logical tabs using the SET
TABS command.  Specifying the tab positions (e.g., SET TABS 10 20 30 40 50) is
the fast way of setting tabs; a slower way of setting them is by issuing the
SET TABS command without options.  WYLBUR lists the column positions and
prompts you for tab settings.  Begin at the left and space over to each
successive column in which you want a tab set, then press the SET key on the
keyboard and type the letter t.  WYLBUR responds by verifying the tab
positions by typing a t in each column position in which a tab has been set.

Once you have set both the physical and logical tabs, the carriage or cursor
actually moves to the proper location when you press the TAB key.  In
addition, issuing the command SET TERMINAL FAST allows you to speed up the
listing of lines with many blanks, since WYLBUR automatically makes use of the
physical tabs when listing the text.  To change back to the logon default (no
physical tabs are assumed), issue the command SET TERMINAL SLOW.

If you enter more than 16 tab settings, WYLBUR only recognizes the first 16.
If there is an error in the SET TABS command, WYLBUR rejects the command and
issues an error message.  If you press the tab key when no tabs have been set,
WYLBUR issues an error message and does not process the line.

The SHOW TABS command allows you to display or verify the current tab
positions.  The CLEAR TABS command erases the current tabs.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION TAB-POSITIONS
.optix tab-positions
tab-positions\\\are the character positions at which the logical tabs are to
                be set.  A maximum of 16 tabs may be set.  Tabs must be
                specified in ascending order (e.g., 5, 10, 15 rather than 5,
                15, 10).

.* OPTION UNNUMBERED
.optix UNNUMBERED
UNNUMBERED\\\\\\specifies that the tabs are relative to absolute column 1
                instead of absolute column 12 (the first column when the line
                numbers are displayed).

.* OPTION GENCOM,AUTO
.optix GENCOM
.optix AUTO
GENCOM|AUTO\\\\\causes certain control characters to be sent to automatically
                set physical tabs on some terminals.  GENCOM is used to set
                tabs on the Gen-Com 300Q and similar terminals.  AUTO causes
                the sequence "ESCAPE\1" (where ESCAPE represents pressing the
                ESCAPE key) to be typed at each tab stop; this sets tabs on
                many other types of terminals as well.

.* OPTION NOVERIFY
.optix NOVERIFY
NOVERIFY\\\\\\\\causes WYLBUR to suppress the tab verification lines used to
                check physical tabs.  NOVERIFY must be specified when setting
                tabs on a terminal without physical tabs.
