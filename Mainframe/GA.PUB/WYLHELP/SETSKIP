SET SKIP [character]

.* DESCRIPTION
The SET SKIP command allows you to specify a SKIP character.  The character
following the SKIP character will not be changed by the preprocessor.  Thus,
you may enter a command line that will have an ESCAPE or a SKIP character in
it after the preprocessor has finished text substitution.  SHOW SKIP displays
the SKIP character.  These commands are primarily useful in EXEC files.
