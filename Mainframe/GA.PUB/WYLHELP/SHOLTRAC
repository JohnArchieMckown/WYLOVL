.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW LTRACE command lets you monitor the terminal input and output of
another terminal session for which tracing has been enabled. This command is
particularly useful for monitoring input and output from server sessions, but
can be used with any session, including virtual sessions run from BATWYL.

SHOW LTRACE will show you a maximum of approximately 1000 lines, depending on
the length of the lines.  (The total buffer size is 31,744 bytes.)

The session you want to trace must have tracing enabled.  For normal sessions,
this is done with the SET TERMINAL TRACE command.  BATWYL sessions have tracing
enabled automatically.  Server sessions can have tracing automatically if
"trace=Yes" is specified in the RPC server profile.

You also must know the password to the account running the session in order to
see the tracing information.

If the session had "trace keep" in effect, then you may still be able to SHOW
LTRACE on it after the session ends.  Only the most recent 50 sessions with
"trace keep" in effect are kept. KEEP is an option on the SET TERMINAL command.

The LMONITOR command is an alternate form of the SHOW LTRACE command with the
MONITOR option.

.* SELECT 'SHOW LTRACE Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION n
.optix n
n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the line number of the session you want to monitor.
                One way to find that out is with the command "SHOW LINES
                VIRTUAL ACCOUNT gg.uuu", where "gg.uuu" is the account whose
                session you want to see.  Note the "(Tracing)" indicator on
                lines where tracing is in effect.  Use the line number, which
                appears at the beginning of the SHOW LINES information, in the
                SHOW LTRACE command.  If no line number (or LIKE option) is
                specified, the same line shown by the previous SHOW LTRACE
                command will be used.

.* OPTION LIKE
.optix LIKE
LIKE name\\\\\\\specifies the account or the name field that appears in the
                SHOW LINE response for the desired session.  The "name" may be
                just a partial match.  Currently this option works only for the
                next subsequently started server session; it will not find
                a session currently running, nor a normal terminal session.

.* OPTION MONITOR
.optix MONITOR
MONITOR\\\\\\\\\requests a continuous display.  When there are no more trace
                entries to be displayed, the command will pause for the number
                of seconds specified on the INTERVAL option.

.* OPTION INTERVAL
.optix INTERVAL
INTERVAL=n\\\\\\specifies the number of seconds for the monitor wait time.
                (See the MONITOR option.)  The default interval is 5 seconds.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the SHOW LTRACE
                command into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for
                a description of these options.
