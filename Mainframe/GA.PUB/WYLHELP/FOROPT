The format-options allow you to specify three attributes of the data set:

   1.\record format and length, using LRECL, etc.

   2.\WYLBUR line number format, using NUMBERED, etc.

   3.\WYLBUR line number position within the data set record, using SEQFLD.

They are meaningful in the commands COPY FROM, COUNT FROM, EXECUTE FROM, LIST
FROM, PRINT FROM, PUNCH FROM, SAVE, SPELL FROM, USE, and (with some
restrictions) in the ORVYL commands GET and PUT.

If you do not specify a format, WYLBUR saves new disk files in EDIT format
(i.e., EDIT is the default format).  Once you have created a disk file with
the desired format, WYLBUR automatically recognizes the format for USE
commands, for SAVE commands into a library, and for SAVE...REPLACE of a
sequential data set.

Special caution must be used when specifying an explicit format for saving
library members.  (Type HELP LIBRARY for a definition of library.)\ The format
attributes apply to the entire WYLBUR user library and not the library members
individually.  Thus, if the format of the member does not agree with that of
the library, WYLBUR issues a warning message like the following:

     Warning: Data set type will be changed to PO U/6356/6356
     OK (Yes/No)?

If you reply OK, YES or Y, WYLBUR changes the format of the library to the
specified format.  However, the new format attributes of the library may not
reflect the actual format attributes of the older library members.  Thus,
programs using these members may encounter difficulties, and the CONDENSE
program may destroy the old members.  (Type HELP CONDENSE for a description of
the CONDENSE command.)\ WYLBUR will be able to access the old members only if
their format is explicitly given.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION EDIT
.optix EDIT
EDIT\\\\\\\\\\\\is the default for writing (e.g., SAVE) new data sets.  EDIT
                is WYLBUR's own data format and is a compressed
                variable-length record format that includes the WYLBUR
                line-numbers.  The maximum data length in an EDIT format
                record is 235.  LRECL is meaningless with EDIT format.  The
                line number format and position need not be specified with the
                EDIT option.

                Note that most non-Stanford software can't read EDIT format;
                you may need to use another format such as RECFM=FB if your
                data set is to be read by such software in a batch job.

.* OPTION CARD
.optix CARD
CARD\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that the data set has fixed-length blocked records
                (RECFM=FB) with a record length of 80 (the term "card" refers
                to the 80-column punched cards once used to store data).

.* OPTION PRINT
.optix PRINT
PRINT\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that the data set has fixed-length blocked records
                with a record length of 133 (i.e., RECFM=FB, LRECL=133).

.optix RECFM
.optix LRECL
.* OPTION RECFM,LRECL
RECFM={F|FB|V|VB}
LRECL=nnn\\\\\\\specify a record format and length.  RECFM=FB indicates
                fixed-length, blocked records:  each record is LRECL bytes
                long and they are grouped in blocks for efficient use of disk
                space.  WYLBUR always saves blocked records so RECFM=F is
                treated as FB.  Records shorter than LRECL are padded with
                blanks; records longer than LRECL are truncated.  RECFM=VB
                specifies variable-length, blocked records.  Each record
                contains a 4-byte record descriptor word (RDW) and as many
                data bytes as are needed; LRECL is the maximum length
                (including the RDW).  Therefore, LRECL should be at least 4
                bytes more than the longest line in the file to be saved.

                If RECFM=FB is specified without LRECL, LRECL=80 (CARD) is
                assumed.  If RECFM=VB is specified without LRECL, LRECL=256 is
                assumed.  If LRECL is specified without RECFM, RECFM=FB is
                assumed.

LRECL=nnn(k)\\\\is obsolete but is still recognized.  This item implies
                RECFM=FB, specifies the LRECL of "nnn" and a blocking factor
                (records per block) of "k".  This is equivalent to specifying
                BLKSIZE with a value of nnn*k.

                Specifying RECFM and/or LRECL on a USE command may cause
                "scrambled" data and/or I/O errors, and should be done only
                when attempting to recover damaged data.

.optix BLKSIZE
.* OPTION BLKSIZE
BLKSIZE=nnn\\\\\specifies the block length to be used on the disk.  The
                maximum value is 32760, but this value is generally not
                efficient for disk files.  For 3390 disks, the optimum block
                size is 27998 (half of a track).  Normally WYLBUR will pick
                the optimum block size for you, based on the type of disk in
                use, so you should only specify BLKSIZE when creating data
                sets that will be read by some program that has peculiar block
                size restrictions.  For RECFM=FB data sets, the actual block
                size must be an integer multiple of LRECL; WYLBUR will round
                the value you specify down automatically.  Thus if you specify
                RECFM=FB LRECL=100 BLKSIZE=27998 the actual block size used
                will be 27900.  Specifying BLKSIZE on a USE command may cause
                I/O errors, and should only be done when attempting to recover
                damaged data.


.* OPTION NUMBERED
.optix NUMBERED
NUMBERED\\\\\\\\on a write operation (e.g. SAVE), it specifies a fixed-length
                blocked record format and that line numbers are to be saved as
                part of the record in the normal WYLBUR line number form; that
                is, nnnnn.nnn with leading blanks inserted as necessary and
                trailing zeroes suppressed.  On a read operation (e.g., USE,
                COPY FROM, EXECUTE FROM) it specifies that the data set is to
                be treated as NUMBERED fixed or variable-length blocked.  For
                non-EDIT format data sets WYLBUR uses the line number stored
                in the record and deletes from the record the columns that
                contain the line number.

.* OPTION UNNUMBERED
.optix UNNUMBERED
UNNUMBERED\\\\\\on a write operation (e.g., SAVE), it specifies a fixed-length
                blocked record format without line numbers in the record.  On
                a read operation (e.g., USE, COPY FROM, EXECUTE FROM), it
                specifies that the data set is to be treated as UNNUMBERED
                fixed or variable-length blocked.

.* OPTION INTEGER
.optix INTEGER
INTEGER\\\\\\\\\has the same meaning as NUMBERED except that the the WYLBUR
                line number is multiplied by 1000, placed in an 8-digit field,
                and padded with leading zeroes as necessary (e.g., line number
                1 becomes 00001000).

.* OPTION SEQFLD
.optix SEQFLD
SEQFLD=({END|pos}[,len])
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\on a write operation (e.g., SAVE), SEQFLD specifies that this
                is a NUMBERED fixed block SAVE.  On a read operation (e.g.,
                USE, COPY FROM, EXECUTE FROM), it specifies that the data set
                is to be treated as NUMBERED fixed or variable-length blocked.
                The subparameters of SEQFLD specify the position and length of
                the line numbers in the record.  The default position is the
                last 8 positions of each record (SEQFLD=(END,8)).  Any column
                position (pos) and any length (len) less than 10 can be
                specified.  On a write operation, line numbers are truncated
                on the left to the length specified without checking for loss
                of digits.  The parentheses can be omitted if the length is
                not changed.
