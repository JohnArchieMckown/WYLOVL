.* DESCRIPTION
The SPELL command verifies the spelling of words in all or part of the active,
EXEC, or external file using WYLBUR's and your private (if you have one
defined) spelling dictionary.  Those words not found are displayed.  Words
that are less than three characters and/or contain non-alphabetic
characters (ie.\'@#$&1234567890') cannot be verified.

The LEARN command adds a word to your private spelling dictionary.  (Type HELP
LEARN for a description of LEARN.)\

When you are using the VIEW command to create or examine a text file, you can
add the SPELL option (or else SET VIEW SPELL prior to the VIEW command) to
request that words that are misspelled or not in the dictionary be highlighted
in the text.  Type HELP VIEW SPELL for more information.

                determined.  (Type HELP RANGE for a description of range.)\ If
                this option is not specified, the entire file is assumed.

.* OPTION EXECUTE
.optix EXECUTE
EXECUTE\\\\\\\\\specifies that the EXEC file, rather than the active file, is
                to be affected.  If this option is not specified, the active
                file is assumed.

.* OPTION FROM

                default range is to be counted.  Type HELP DSNAME for a

.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to use of a data set belonging to an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of

                this option is not specified, the volume set with the SET
                VOLUME command will be searched; if no volume is set, the
                system catalog, an index of data sets, will be searched for
                the data set name and volume location.  (All data sets are
                automatically cataloged when they are saved, unless you
                specify otherwise.)\
