WYLBUR

WYLBUR is a program that can be used for text-editing, for job submission and
retrieval, and for communicating with others who have a Forsythe account.  In
addition, through the combination of the WYLBUR preprocessor (an expression
evaluator) and some WYLBUR commands (e.g., EXECUTE, SET VALUE, READ), WYLBUR
can be used as a programming language.

For a list of the WYLBUR commands, type HELP COMMANDS.  Type HELP to find out
how to get information about each command.

The following commands are the basic tools used in WYLBUR.
