.* DESCRIPTION

                  ***  EXPERIMENTAL FACILITY  ***
             ***  SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE  ***

This command simulates the ATTN key on a 3270 terminal.

An "ATTN" Signal is sent to the application, and the terminal is returned to
the VLOGON session.

Note: In some cases the "ESC-A" keyboard sequence can also be used.  This
      command returns the terminal to the VLOGON session, which has been
      suspended by using the "BREAK" key on the terminal.

Type HELP VISTA for more information on the VTAM terminal interface.
