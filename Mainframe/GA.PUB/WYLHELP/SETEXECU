.* SELECT 'SET EXECUTE Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION LOG,NOLOG
.optix LOG
.optix NOLOG
LOG|NOLOG\\\\\\\LOG specifies that all commands should be listed before
                execution.  NOLOG, the logon default, suppresses the listing
                of commands before execution.  This only applies to
                non-extended EXECs.  For information on logging extended EXEC
                files, type HELP XDEBUG.

.* OPTION LIMIT
.optix LIMIT
LIMIT=n|NOLIMIT\specifies the total number of commands that can be executed in
                an EXEC file, before WYLBUR displays the message:

                   <count> commands executed (at line <line-number>).

                The default is 1000 commands without the message.  NOLIMIT
                suppresses the message, regardless of how commands are
                executed.  NOLIMIT should be used with caution, since you will
                receive no warning of an indefinite loop.

.* OPTION LLIMIT
.optix LLIMIT
LLIMIT=n\\\\\\\\sets a command limit as above for the local EXEC; this is
                usually specified within an EXEC to override the global limit
                set with SET EXEC LIMIT.  This affects only the current local
                EXEC and does not reset the global limit set with SET EXEC
                LIMIT.
