LOCK
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The LOCK command clears your terminal screen and then prompts you for your
password, blocking any further interaction with your terminal session until
you enter your password correctly.  It is useful in situations where you want
to leave your terminal for a few minutes without logging off, but wish to
protect your session from any unauthorized use by others.

Besides your password, WYLBUR will also accept the commands LOGOFF and LOGON
in response to the LOCK command's prompt.  The SAVE option may be added to
both of them, which causes WYLBUR to save the active file or files before
logging off the account.

The LOCK command does not override any automatic timeout that would log your
account off after a certain amount of inactivity.
