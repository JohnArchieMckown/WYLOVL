.* DESCRIPTION
The SET OUTPUT command allows you to change the permanent default destination,
bin or forms code used in printing output.  If you do not specify an account,
the account of logged-on user is assumed.

SHOW OUTPUT displays the current values of OUTPUT for the specified account.
Type HELP SHOW OUTPUT for a more detailed description of the command.

.* SELECT 'SET OUTPUT Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION GG.UUU,ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR,PUBLIC
.optix gg.uuu
gg.uuu\\\\\\\\\\specifies the account to set the default output options of an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  Type HELP
                ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a description of the account-options.  If
                this option is specified, you will be prompted for the
                password of the account before the command is executed.

.* OPTION DEST
.optix DEST
DEST=destination
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the destination for printing the output of the job.
                Valid destinations include:

                   LOCAL         Forsythe Hall (specifically, printers attached
                                 to the computer you're logged on to)
                   FORSYTHE      Forsythe Hall (for SYSA, same as "local")
                   RMTn          Remote work station n

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Do not specify SELF (indicating the self-service printer) as a
                destination on a SET OUTPUT command.  You are likely to lose
                output that is printed when you are not there to retrieve it.

.* OPTION BIN
.optix BIN
BIN=nnn\\\\\\\\\specifies the bin in which output will be put for you to
                pickup.  Check that the bin you want to use exists and is
                convenient to you before changing this value.  The default bin
                number is the one assigned when you get a Data Center account.

.* OPTION FORMS
.optix FORMS
FORMS=ffff\\\\\\specifies the form on which the output should be printed,
                where ffff is a 1-4 character forms code.  FORMS=BOND is the
                default for new accounts.  USE DOC#FORMS PUBLIC for a
                description of the valid codes.  If PRTFORMS is also set (see
                below), the FORMS option affects only output from batch jobs.
                The FORMS setting does not affect output sent to remote or
                department printers (with the DEST option on the PRINT command,
                for example); PRTFORMS does, however.

.* OPTION PRTFORMS
.optix PRTFORMS
PRTFORMS=ffff|NOPRTFORMS
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies the form on which output from a PRINT command should
                be printed if no other form is specified on the PRINT command.
                "ffff" is a 1-4 character forms code.  USE DOC#FORMS PUBLIC for
                a description of the valid codes.  This overrides the FORMS
                option for PRINT commands.  PRTFORMS also affects output from
                PRINT commands sent to a remote (department) printer with the
                DEST option; if you request GBAR output for PRTFORMS, then
                output to a LaserWriter or LaserJet printer that can handle
                gray-scale printing will be printed in landscape mode with a
                gray-bar pattern.  Use NOPRTFORMS to turn off PRTFORMS, so that
                the FORMS option controls all output.

.* OPTION HOLD,NOHOLD
.optix HOLD
.optix NOHOLD
HOLD|NOHOLD\\\\\HOLD puts a job in output hold before it is released for
                printing.  NOHOLD specifies that the job output is not held.
                Output is held until you RELEASE or PURGE it or until it
                has stayed in output hold over the time limit.

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the SET OUTPUT
                command into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for
                a description of these options.

.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\suppresses the system response that WYLBUR issues if the
                SET OUTPUT command is successful.
