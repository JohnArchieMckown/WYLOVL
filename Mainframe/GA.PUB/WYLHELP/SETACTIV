SET ACTIVE [n] {[NAME=name] [TITLE='text'] [TEMPORARY|NOTEMPORARY]}

.* DESCRIPTION
The SET ACTIVE command assigns a name and or title to a particular active
file.  If no active file number is specified, it affects the current active
file.  The active file's number, name and title may be displayed with the SHOW
ACTIVE command.  You can also use the command to make an existing file
temporary or non-temporary.

.* SELECT  'SET ACTIVE Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION N
.optix n
n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\the number of the active file to be affected.  The default is
                the current active file.

.* OPTION NAME
.optix NAME
NAME\\\\\\\\\\\\the name to assign to the active file.  By default, this is
                the name of the file or program the active file came from or
                is "NEW" for newly collected text.

.* OPTION TITLE
.optix TITLE
TITLE='text'\\\\the title to assign to the active file.  It must be enclosed
                in single or double quotation marks.

.* OPTION TEMPORARY,NOTEMPORARY
.optix TEMPORARY
TEMPORARY|NOTEMPORARY
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\changes the kind of active file from temporary to
                non-temporary, or vice versa.  A temporary active file is
                often used by programs that need to use the active file but
                don't want it to linger around in the user's session after
                the program is finished.  A temporary active file does not
                show up in the display from the SHOW ACTIVES or SHOW ACTIVES
                ALL command unless it is the current active file.  (To see
                what temporary active files are around, SHOW ACTIVES TEMP.)
                No auto-recovery is done for temporary active files either.
                TEMP and NOTEMP are the abbreviations for this option.
