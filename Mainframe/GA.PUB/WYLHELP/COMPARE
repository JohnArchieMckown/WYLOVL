.* DESCRIPTION
The COMPARE command compares two ranges of lines in the active file beginning
at the lines specified.  The comparison stops if the lines are not identical.
Then, WYLBUR lists the lines and (if neither SINGLE nor NOLIST is specified),
prompts you with:

     Continue (Yes/No)?

If you reply YES or OK, WYLBUR resumes the compare at the next lines.  (This
is useful when a line has changed, but no lines have been inserted or
deleted).  WYLBUR resumes the comparison with the next lines in the range,
unless you request otherwise.  You may do so by specifying two line-numbers
after the YES/OK.  For example:

     Continue (Yes/No)? ok *,next
or...
     Continue (Yes/No)? yes 15.1 5000.1

COMPARE sets the current line pointer to the line in the first range that does
not match.  If all lines compare, the current line pointer is set to "-1".
This makes it possible for EXEC files to determine the results of the compare.
The following example illustrates how you might use this in an EXEC file:

   \\\\1.\\\\ use copy1 clear
   \\\\2.\\\\ copy from copy2 to 50000
   \\\\3.\\\\ compare first,50000 single nolist
   \\\\4.\\\\ if (* eq -1) comment copy1 and copy2 are the same
   \\\\5.\\\\ else show value *

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION LINE-NUMBER1
.optix line-number1
line-number1\\\\is the beginning line number of the first range.  This range
                is compared to the second range, the beginning of which is
                specified by line-number2.  The two ranges must be in the
                active file.

.* OPTION LINE-NUMBER2
.optix line-number2
line-number2\\\\is the beginning line number of the second range.  This range
                is compared to the first range, the beginning of which is
                specified by line-number1.  The two ranges must be in the
                active file.

.* OPTION COLUMNS,COLS
.optix COLUMNS
COLUMNS=m[/n]\\\restricts the comparison to the columns specified.  If only m
                is specified, columns n through 235 are used.  Otherwise, the
                entire line is used.

.* OPTION SINGLE,S
.optix SINGLE
SINGLE\\\\\\\\\\specifies that the "Continue (Yes/No)?" prompt should not be
                issued when the comparison stops because two lines do not
                compare.

.* OPTION LIST-OPTIONS,LIST,NOLIST,NOTEXT,NUMBERED,UNNUMBERED,NONUMBERED,INTEGER
.optix list-options
list-options\\\\LIST, the default list-option for this command, causes the
                lines that failed to compare to be listed.  For additional
                list-options, type HELP LIST-OPTIONS.
