PROC procname ([variable-list]) BEGIN
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
(** Extended EXECs only **)
The PROC statement starts a procedure within an Extended EXEC file.  The
procname is the name with which the procedure is invoked on the PCALL
statement.

The same number of variables must be declared on the PROC statement as are
passed on the PCALL statement.  For example:

        PCALL calc (num, step, total)
        . . .
      PROC (principal, interest, net)

The variables are mapped in the order in which they are declared.  If no
variables are passed to the PROC, include an empty set of parentheses on the
PROC statement.

The BEGIN must follow the variable list, and should be matched by an END at
the END of the PROC.
