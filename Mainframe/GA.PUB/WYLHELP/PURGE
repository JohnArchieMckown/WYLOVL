suppress the job's output.  PURGE can stop job processing when the job is in
execution only if the CANCEL option is included.

.* SELECT 'PURGE Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION JOBID
.optix jobid
jobid\\\\\\\\\\\identifies the job(s) to be purged.  This option is required
                and must be specified first.  If the jobid describes multiple
                jobs, you must also include the MULTIPLE option.  Type HELP
                JOBID for a description of the various forms of this option.

.* OPTION MULTIPLE
.optix MULTIPLE
MULTIPLE\\\\\\\\causes the command to be processed if the jobid matches more
                than one jobname in the system.  When several jobs are
                explicitly referred to by number, the MULTIPLE option is not
                necessary.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR
.optix account-options
account-options\specify the account to purge a job or jobs belonging to an
                account other than that of the logged-on user.  One form of
                this option is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
                for a description of the account-options.  If this option is
                specified, you will be prompted for the password of the
                account before the command is executed.

.* OPTION QUEUE-OPTIONS,QUEUE,Q,EXEC,XEQ,OUTPUT
.optix queue-options
queue-options\\\allow further selection of jobs to be affected by the command.
                Jobs must be in the specified queue (i.e., EXEC or OUTPUT) to
                be affected.  Type HELP QUEUE-OPTIONS for a description of
                these options.

.* OPTION CANCEL
.optix CANCEL
CANCEL\\\\\\\\\\allows you to terminate a job that is in execution, and purge
                any output.  If the job is not executing, the CANCEL option is
                ignored but the PURGE command is executed.  If the job is
                executing and the CANCEL option is not given, the PURGE
                command will be rejected and a message to that effect will be
                given.

.* OPTION OUTPUT-OPTIONS,OUTPUT,PRINT,PUNCH,FICHE,PLOT,SYSOUT,FORMS
.optix output-options
output-options\\allow you to restrict the effect of the PURGE command to
                selected groups of data sets.  OUTPUT is the only valid
                output-option when the job is awaiting execution.  However, as
                soon as a job has begun execution, all other options may be
                used.  Type HELP OUTPUT-OPTIONS for a description of the
                output-options.

.* OPTION OUTGRP
.optix outgrp
OUTGRP=grp\\\\\\lets you specify a particular output queue entry when a job has
                several. The outgroup identifiers for a job can be seen with
                the INFO option on the LOCATE command.

.* OPTION DEST
.optix DEST
DEST=destination
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\allow you to restrict to jobs only directed to a certain
                destination, such as an office printer or the self-service
                printer (DEST=SELF).

.* OPTION COLLECT-OPTIONS,BY,KEEP,NOCLEAR,NOCLR,CLEAR,CLR,WARN,NOWARN
.optix collect-options
collect-options\allow you to insert the system response to the PURGE command
                into your active file.  Type HELP COLLECT-OPTIONS for a
                description of these options.

.pa
.* OPTION QUIET
.optix QUIET
QUIET\\\\\\\\\\\requests that all system responses be suppressed if the PURGE
                command is successful.
