.* DESCRIPTION
(** Extended EXECs only **)
XLOAD loads an Extended EXEC into the EXEC file space.

When you XCALL an Extended EXEC from a disk file, it is loaded into the EXEC
file space only once; on subsequent XCALLs the already loaded version is used.
If you have made changes to the EXEC file after the first XCALL, they will not
be loaded unless you specifically XLOAD the file.
