WHILE (expression) {command|BEGIN}
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
(** Extended EXECs only **)
The WHILE statement evaluates an expression and, if it is true, executes the
following command or block of commands.  It then repeats until the expression
evaluates to false.

The expression must evaluate to TRUE or FALSE and must be enclosed in
parentheses.  The block of commands must be enclosed with BEGIN and END
statements, and the BEGIN statement must be on the same line as the WHILE
statement.

For example:

     WHILE (i LE 20) BEGIN
        array[i] = i
        i = i + 1
     END
