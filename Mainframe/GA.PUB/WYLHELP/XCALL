.* DESCRIPTION
(** Extended EXECs only **)
The XCALL command executes an Extended EXEC file.  The EXEC file must begin
with the XPROC statement.

You may pass parameters to an EXEC file either with a variable list (a list of
variables enclosed in parentheses) or a parameter string either enclosed in
quotes or separated from the XCALL command with a slash (/).  The
parameter-string method is most often used from the command line; the
parameter passed is stored in the variable PARM_STRING.

XA is a valid abbreviation for XCALL ACTIVE.  The following XCALL commands are
valid:

     XCALL MYEXEC ('VT100',10,TRUE)
     XCALL TERMEXEC ACCOUNT E1.ABC 'VT100'
     XCALL WYL.E1.ABC.COUNT / VT100
     XCALL ACTIVE
     XA

.* SELECT 'XCALL Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION ACTIVE
.optix ACTIVE
ACTIVE\\\\\\\\\\executes the Extended EXEC file in the active file.  The
                command XCALL ACTIVE may be abbreviated to XA.  You cannot
                XCALL the active file from within an Extended EXEC.

.* OPTION DSNAME
.optix dsname
dsname\\\\\\\\\\the name of the data set containing the Extended EXEC file.
                If the data set belongs to another account, you may use the
                account-options.  If the dataset is a library, use the format
                libname#member, not libname(member).

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS,ACCOUNT,ACCT,GROUP,GRP,USER,USR,PUBLIC
.optix account-options
account-options\specify another account if the file containing the EXEC file
                does not belong to the logged-on account.  One form of these
                options is:  ACCOUNT gg.uuu.  Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for
                more information on these options.

.* OPTION ON,VOLUME
.optix ON
ON\volume\\\\\\\indicates the disk volume where the specified data set is
                located.  (Type HELP VOLUME for a description of volume.)\ If
                this option is not specified, WYLBUR searches the system
                catalog for the data set name and its volume location.  If the
                data set is not cataloged, WYLBUR will use the volume set with
                the SET VOLUME command.

.* OPTION VARIABLE-LIST,VARIABLES
.optix variable-list
(variable-list)\passes a list of variables to the Extended EXEC file.  The
                list must be enclosed in parentheses, and variables should be
                separated by commas.  The EXEC should have the same number of
                variables in a variable list on its opening XPROC statement.

.* OPTION PARAMETER-STRING,PARAMETERS
.optix parameter-string
/parameter-string
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\passes a single parameter string to the EXEC file.  This
                string must either be enclosed in quotes or must be preceded
                by a slash (/).  This parameter is put in the variable
                PARM_STRING in the Extended EXEC, and the variable PARM_COUNT
                is set to -1 to indicate that a string has been passed.
