The list-options are actually a collection of associated keyword parameters
valid in most editing commands (i.e., CHANGE, COLLECT, COMPARE, COPY,
DELETE, EXCHANGE, INSERT, JOIN, LIST, MODIFY, MOVE, POINT, REPLACE).

Some editing commands like INSERT, MOVE, and COPY have a default NOLIST
option.  Other commands like EDIT, MODIFY, and CHANGE have a default LIST
option.  The SET MODES command has LIST and NOLIST options that allow you to
change the default list option for some commands.  Type HELP SET MODES LIST
NOLIST for a description of the LIST and NOLIST options.
