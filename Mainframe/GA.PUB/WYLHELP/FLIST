.* Pseudo command
.boxon
FLIST associative-range FROM {lib-specs|cat-specs} [collect-options]
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
The FLIST command lists an associative range from multiple WYLBUR data sets.
An associative line range is usually a range containing a certain string of
characters:  'test' or c'sample'.

FLIST lists ranges either from the members of a library as specified by
<lib-specifications> or from a number of cataloged data sets as specified by
the <cat-specifications>.  <lib-specifications> consist of any options that
would follow a 'SHOW DIR FOR' ...  command.  <cat-specifications> take the
form of a 'SHOW CAT' command, but with the leading 'SHOW' deleted.

Sample commands:

   ; look for jcl in all members of lib
   flist '//'1 and c'exec' from lib

   ; look for memos to bob in members like #memo--- in lib
   flist c'bob' from lib like memo

   ; look for procedure network in net.source.---- data sets
   flist 'procedure' and 'network' from cat like net.source

   ; get a list of members that contain jcl into active file
   flist '//' and 'EXEC' from jcllib collect clear

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION associative-range
.optix associative-range
associative-range
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\a line range containing a given string of characters.  For
                example, the range 'test' is the range of all lines containing
                the string of characters 'test.  Type HELP RANGE for more
                information on line ranges.

.* OPTION LIB-SPEC
.optix lib-spec
lib-spec\\\\\\\\information about the library members to search:  usually the
                library name, and possibly LIKE xxx, FROM xxx, and/or TO xxxx.
                This is the same information that would follow a SHOW
                DIRECTORY FOR command.  For example, FLIST 'string' FROM LIB
                LIKE DATA.  Type HELP SHOW DIRECTORY for information on the
                LIKE, FROM and TO options.

.* OPTION CAT-SPEC

cat-spec\\\\\\\\information about which cataloged files to search.  This
                always begins with CAT, and may also contain information such
                as LIKE xxx, FROM xxx and TO xxx.  For example, FLIST 'string'
                FROM CAT LIKE PROG.  Type HELP SHOW CATALOG for information on
                the LIKE, FROM and TO options.
