EXEC Files

Many utility functions can be performed through the use of prepackaged WYLBUR
programs called EXEC files.  For example, using EXEC files you can copy data
sets to tape, or format a document with SCRIPT (a text formatter).  Following
is a list of some of the most frequently used EXEC files contained in public
libraries, including a description of the function of each.  You can access an
EXEC file by issuing the command:

   UTIL execfile

where "execfile" is one of the public EXEC files.

For a complete listing of the available public EXEC files, type the command:

     SHOW DIRECTORY FOR LIB PUBLIC
