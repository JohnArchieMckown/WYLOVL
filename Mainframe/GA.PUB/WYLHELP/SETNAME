.* DESCRIPTION
The SET NAME command allows you to set a user name of up to 20 characters that
will be displayed in the SHOW LINE/SHOW LINES responses and TO/MAIL message
headers.  In addition, the "programmer name" field of jobs submitted will be
filled in with the user name (if otherwise blank).

The SET NAME command need only be issued once for an account; it lasts across
terminal sessions.  You can use the SET LINE command to override the user name
when it is displayed in the SHOW LINE/SHOW LINES responses for the current
terminal session.  Type HELP SET LINE for a description of the command.

The SHOW NAME command displays the current user name.  Type HELP SHOW NAME for
a description of the command.
