MacSamson

Samson is a computer program developed at Stanford.  It is available for the
IBM PC, the Hewlett-Packard TouchScreen, and the Apple Macintosh.  It makes a
personal computer work as a terminal connected to the Data Center computer
(located in Forsythe Hall) and allows you to transfer files between your
computer and the Data Center.  As a terminal, it emulates a DEC VT100.

Samson for the Macintosh (known as MacSamson) can be used on any Macintosh with
1024K or more memory.  MacSamson version 4 supports Macs with more than 1024K
memory and System 4.2 or later.

MacSamson is easy to use; once you have loaded the program and logged on to the
Data Center, you can move between your Mac and the Data Center with ease.
Issuing a simple USE or SAVE command allows you to transfer files between the
two systems.  While MacSamson is loaded, you can communicate with the Data
Center, as well as examine and manipulate files on the diskettes of your Mac.

The MacSamson documentation and the diskettes containing the program are
available from the Data Center's Account Services office in Spruce Hall.

When you use MacSamson to connect to Forsythe, you should issue the command
SET TERMINAL SAMSON to tell Forsythe that you are using the Samson (MacSamson)
program.  Otherwise, you will not be able to use many of MacSamson's special
features.

MacSamson supports all Macintosh keyboards.  For help mapping the keyboard you
have with the special uses MacSamson assigns to some of the keys, see the
MacSamson Users Guide, or type HELP TERMINAL MACSAM.
