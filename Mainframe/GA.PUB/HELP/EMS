EMS is a command used to access EMS, an electronic message system that uses
both WYLBUR and SPIRES to allow you to send, receive and file messages on the
computer.  Since EMS has its own HELP facility, you generally find help for
doing specific things by typing EMS HELP.

EMS HELP works only if you have an EMS file.  If you want to set up an EMS
file, issue the command EMS SETUP.

For more information about EMS in general, see the document Using Electronic
Mail on Forsythe, available through the PUBLISH command.
