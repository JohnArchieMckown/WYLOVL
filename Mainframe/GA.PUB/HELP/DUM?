DUMP Commands

The DUMP Command allows you to put the response from any SHOW command into
your active file.  For example, DUMP DSNAMES (instead of SHOW DSNAMES) places
all your data set names at the end of your active file.

The following is a list of possible DUMP commands.  For a description of any
of these commands, type:

     HELP DUMP option

where 'option' would be the command you are interested in.
