FORMS ACTION

When you wish to search and display an online University form (for instance, to
check its current routing status) issue the following command:

  PRISM//SELECT FORMS ACTION        <--(Be sure to exit EMS, if necessary,
                                       before issuing this command)

After asking for your PIN, the command above takes you into the Forms Action
file in Prism, where you can search and retrieve forms that you originated, or
forms that have your name listed in the routing as an approver.  Within Forms
Action, type SEARCH to see a complete list of types of searches available.

Once you've retrieved a form, you can print a copy in Prism using the PRINT
command.  For more information on University forms, please use SUGGEST in Prism
to request copies of our latest guides and help cards.

You will need a University ID and PIN to search and retrieve online forms.
Contact Records and Systems in Personnel if you do not now have an ID or PIN.
