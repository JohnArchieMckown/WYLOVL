.item 'OED Command' 'Added 06/24/92 by JNK'
OED [term [MATCH]] [BRIEF] [PLAIN] [collect-options]

The OED command sends a request across the SUNet network to a dictionary server
on a computer maintained by Stanford University Libraries.  The dictionary is
an online version of the Oxford English Dictionary.

You can use OED to get dictionary definitions and verify spellings of
individual words.  However, OED entries are often quite long and scholarly; the
WEBSTER command is a valuable alternative when you need simple dictionary
information.

Because the OED information is stored on another computer, the Stanford
Data Center cannot guarantee that the command will be available at all times.
If you receive a message that OED is unavailable, please try again later.

.* OPTION MATCH

                would return a long list of terms, including FARM, FARMER,
                FARM-WIFE and GENTLEMAN-FARMER.  You could then look up any of
                those terms with a new OED command.
