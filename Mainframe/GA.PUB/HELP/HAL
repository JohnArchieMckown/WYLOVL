.* DESCRIPTION
General Overview of Documentation:
----------------------------------

The documentation below was developed by the MVS  Systems  Group  to
help  the  Application Support Y2K Test Group understand 'how to' do
their work in the SYSH Y2K environment.  It is our goal  to  provide
as  good  a  test  environment  as  possible while still adhering to
procedures that will prevent date/data contamination across  systems
when in the Y2K test dates.

It must be remembered that when the system leaps forward any changes
made will  be  lost  when  the  system  is  reset  to  the  present.

.* OPTION Schedule
.optix schedule
Preliminary SYSH System Testing Hours:
------------------------------------------

Because it is difficult to know what will be experienced  each  time
we  leap  forward to test dates in the Year 2000 and since we do not
know how much time any group will  want  for  testing  changes,  the
schedule we have put together below is at best tentative and subject
to change.  If Systems & Applications staff agree to a more flexible
schedule  for testing in the year 2000 and restoring back to current
date, this schedule will no longer be valid.

Schedule as constructed October 5,1998:

Day of week    Test   Windows     Start   Comments
                                  Clock
Thursday    10/01/98 - 10/07/98   11:00   week long stay in 1998;
            (dates will change)           open for regression tests
                                          and system test time

Thursday    12/30/99 - 01/01/00   23:45
Friday      02/28/00 - 02/29/00   23:45   3 day window
Saturday    02/29/00 - 03/01/00
Sunday      03/01/00 - 03/02/00
Monday      12/31/00 - 01/01/01   23:45
Tuesday     02/28/04 - 02/29/04   23:45   2 day window

SYSH Y2K Testing Dates:
-----------------------

Although the list below will probably expand as we get further  into
testing   our   systems,   applications  and  programs  in  the  Y2K
environment, I thought I would construct this  preliminary  list  of
dates that would be tested:

      Date                           Reason
      ____                           ______

  Dec.31,1999 to Jan.1,2000         Change from 1999 to 2000

  Dec.30,1999 to Dec.31,1999        watch for expiration

  Sep.8,1999 to Sep.9,1999          Watch for expiration

  Feb.28,2000 to Mar.1,2000         Ensure leap day recognition

  Feb.29,2000 to Mar.1,2000         Ensure leap day recognition

  Dec.31,2000 to Jan.1,2001         Check end of year

  Feb.28,2004 to Feb.29,2004        Ensure leap day recognition

Sample Regression Testing Dates
-------------------------------

      Date                           Reason
      ____                           ______

  Dec.31,1998 to Jan.1,1999          Ensure year end correctly
                                     identified

  Feb.27,1999 to Mar.1,1999          Ensure non-leap year
                                     recognition

.* OPTION LOGON
.optix logon
Methods of Logging on to SYSH

Wylbur logon:
--------------
If you do not already have a SYSH account you get  one  by  emailing
your  request to bill.bauriedel@forsythe.stanford.edu.  Your request
should be processed within 24-48 hours.

Once you have your account set for SYSH, you are ready to  logon  to
the system.

     > Host name = ELF 300 or SYSH

     > Message "System maintenance in progress, logon not allowed.."

     > Enter "SYSH"

     > Enter your account followed by your password.

Now you are ready to use SYSH.

TSO logon:
----------

To  get  a  TSO  account,  send   an   online   email   request   to
jcotillier@stanford.edu.   Your  request  should be processed within
24-48 hours.

Note: Since your wylbur password supersedes RACF (which TSO uses), you
      will find that if you change your wylbur password, it will also
      change the password you use when logging into SYSH via TSO.


Extra Software need for TSO connection:

In order to log onto TSO, you will need a TN3270 program
installed on your system.

To access SYSH TSO via VTAM:

   >  Specify TSOH as the application name instead of TSO

To access SYSH TSO directly via TCPIP:

   >  Specify the host name as SYSH-TSO instead of the usual
      Forsythe-IBM


First Time logon:

Note:  if you are logging into TSO on SYSH the first time,  you  may
receive this message:

       Unable to allocate SYSH.ISPPROF
       If you wish to use (PDF), run ISPFINIT once.
       ISPF

       ***

At the command line; enter:
                          ISPFINIT

At the 'READY' prompt; enter:
                             PDF

Now you are ready to use TSO/ISPF on SYSH.



.* OPTION MAIL
.optix mail
Wylbur Mail on SYSH:
--------------------

You will not be able to SHOW MAIL on SYSH  unless  your  account  on
SYSH is set to allow it.

To have your SYSH account set to allow mail, send a request to  Bill
Bauriedel at:  bill.bauriedel@forsythe.stanford.edu

After your SYSH account is set to allow  mail,  logon  to  SYSH  and
issue the command SET MAIL to define your SYSH WYLBUR mail box.

Your SYSH userid can receive mail sent  to  "userid@SYSH"  and  your
SYSA  account  will  continue  to  receive  mail sent to your normal
"userid@Forsythe".

You can SAVE your WYLBUR active file on your  hard  disk  (typically
you do SAVE C:  and fill in the details in a dialog box), then logon
to  SYSH  and  USE it.  Likewise, you can use cut/paste in Samson to
move small amounts of data.  Note that  these  methods,  like  mail,
will  not  preserve line-numbers, so using them to move an old-style
execfile will not work.

.* OPTION PASSWORD
.optix password
Passwords and RACF profiles:
-----------------------------

When SYSH is ready for testing, selected AS staff will  be  able  to
access  SYSH  to test the applications.  The wylbur keyword file and
RACF database will be copied over to SYSH.   That  means  that  your
password  and  dataset  access  rules on SYSH will, at that point in
time, be the same as what they were on SYSA.

After each round of Y2K testing is complete, the  database  will  be
refreshed  to  the  current  year,  and  any  password that has been
changed during the test period will revert to it's previous setting.

Note:  Each time we return to current date to make changes to the
system and you make changes to your applications, we will take a
'snapshot' of the system before we leap forward to Y2K again.
Whatever passwords and profiles exist at the point of the 'snapshot'
will be the ones in use when we return to current date.  Passwords
and profile changes made during Y2K testing, will not exist anymore.

TSO passwords will expire as a result of leaping forward into the
year 2000 because TSO passwords are good for 30 days.  When this
happens to you during TSO logon when in Y2K mode (and you are unable
to reset it in the start up panel, simply open a wylbur session, set
your password and wylbur will update TSO.

.* OPTION Tapes
.optix tapes
Scratch Tapes on SYSH:
---------------

There are two pools of scratch tapes on SYSH.

"K" (3490) tape series will be mounted on 3490E tapes  drives.   The
tape  drives  will  be  available  Monday thru Friday from 9:00am to
5:00pm.

"Y" (3480) tape series will be mounted on  3480  tape  drives.   The
tape drives are available 7x24.

You can write a tape on either system, and read  it  on  the  other,
copying  to  disk or tape.  For example, you could run a job on SYSA
that writes an S-series tape (3480 scratch pool), then you could run
a job on SYSH that copies it to a SYSH 3480 scratch tape (K  series)
or  to  disk.   The  TLMS  rule is that tapes that belong to TLMS on
another system can be read, but not written.  TLMS knows which tapes
belong to which systems, but can't access the actual records on  the
other systems and thus does not know the owner account, etc., of the
foreign tape.

There is no problem reading (on SYSA) tapes created "in the  future"
on  SYSH.   However,  you  should not use IEHMOVE to unload "future"
data from SYSH to tape, and then restore on SYSA, as  IEHMOVE  keeps
create data info for disk files.

Guidelines for using SYSH tapes:
--------------------------------

Standard TLMS procedures will be in affect.  'K' series  tapes  will
be  used  for  3490E's  and 'Y' series will be used for 3480 scratch
tapes mounts.

The 'SET TAPE RELEASE' process on SYSH works the same as SYSA.

TLMS is not Y2K compliant.

Tapes created in the future (Y2K) will stay in  existence  only  for
the  time  SYSH  is in the Y2K mode.  Once the system is restored to
original 1998 date, TLMS will have no knowledge of these tapes.

   .any tape created when in present day CCYY, will remain in the
    TLMS database until released.
   .tapes created in a Y2K date, will exist in the TLMS database
    for the duration of the time spent in Y2K mode on SYSH. Once
    we return to current CCYY, the tape will appear as 'released'.
   .to retain data on Y2K generated tapes, copy them to an 'S'
    series tape on SYSA.

   SYSA tapes can be read on SYSH but cannot be written to on SYSH.
   SYSH tapes can be read on SYSA but cannot be written to on SYSA.

   3420 (round reel) tapes needs to be copied to 3480 'S' series
   tapes before they can be read on SYSH.  There are no 3420 tape
   drives being allocated to SYSH.


   The 'Auto Scratch' program is running on SYSH but has yet  to  be
   tested.   To  get  an  'Auto scratch' entry added on SYSH, send
   your requests via email to Mark Lawrence
   (m.lawrence@forsythe).

   Current TOSS is not working on SYSH as yet TOSS will only be used
   for testing Y2K date issues; will be no rotation of tapes offsite
   as in production TOSS on SYSA.

.* OPTION SHARED-DISK,MOVING-DATA-WITHOUT-SHARED-DISKS
.optix shared-disk
.optix moving-data-withoug-shared-disks

Shared SYSA/SYSH disk info:
-----------------------------

While in current date mode, there will be one shared disk between
SYSA and SYSH to allow for the transfer of files.  SCRHOO will have
datasets scratched at 6am every morning.  This disk can be used as a
temporary conduit to eventually save files on SYSH volumes.

For example, to save the file 'myhelp' on SCRH00 type the following:
\\\\\\SYSA> SAVE MYHELP on SCRH00
In order to use the file on SYSH simply type:
\\\\\\SYSH> USE MYHELP on SCRHOO
Save the file to the appropriate volume when you are finished.
The next VITAL step is to uncatalog the file on SYSA.  This is
accomplished by issuing the following command on SYSA:
\\\\\\SYSA> UNCAT MYHELP

Once SYSH is in Y2K date mode, this volume will be kept offline
until we return to current date.  When in Y2K mode, transfer of
files to SYSH will have to be done either by tape or FTP.


Shared disk using Wylbur or TSO:
---------------------------------

The SYSH scratch volume SCRH00 is normally kept online to SYSA
whenever SYSH is in "current date" mode.  You can save datasets on
it from WYLBUR in the usual way on either system, and use them on
the other system (they won't be cataloged on the other system).
Bear in mind that SCRH00 is erased daily at 0600, just like SCR002
is on SYSA.  Data passed via that disk should be moved to permanent
storage if it is to be kept.

This method is not available when SYSH is in "future" mode.

Shared disk using batch job:
-----------------------------

You can use batch jobs on the two  systems  to  pass  data  via  the
shared  disk  in  a manner analogous to the use WYLBUR or TSO.  This
allows you to move data of a type that cannot be handled  by  WYLBUR
or by the TSO editors.

The JCL in SYS3.SYSTEM.HALJCL(COPY#DSK) can be used to copy all  (or
selected)  members  of  a  PDS on SYSA to a PDS on SYSH; this method
preserves directory information  and  can  even  be  used  for  load
modules.   See  the  comments  in the JCL for instructions on how to
change it to meet your requirements.  This job is run on SYSA and it
submits a second job that runs on SYSH  to  move  the  data  to  its
permanent  storage  disks.   If there is interest, I will create the
corresponding SYSH to SYSA job.

Please note when using batch with shared disk  that  an  attempt  to
reference  SCRH00  on  SYSA when it is not available will cause your
job to abend (allocation recovery,  operator  cancel).   To  prevent
this,  any  JCL  you write for such transfers must include this EXEC
statement as its first step:

  //  EXEC  UCBCHECK,PARM='VOL=SCRH00'

and subsequent steps referring to SCRH00 must  use  IF  or  COND  to
prevent their execution of the UCBCHECK step issues a nonzero return
code.

Moving data without shared disks:
----------------------------------

In order to obtain files from the mainframe, it is necessary to ftp
to the mainframe with the following command structure:

ftp forsythe-ibm.stanford.edu
Username: GG$UUU
Password: ALLUPPER
cd 'WYL.GG.UUU'
binary or acsii
get FILENAME
quit

Note:  the FILENAME is assumed to be catalogued on SYSA.  You can
use the "quote SITE" command (see below) to choose things like
VOL=SYSA03 if the dataset isn't catalogued.

To put a file, you must tell the mainframe about the file:

quote SITE PRI=20 TRACKS RECFM=FB LRECL=64 BLKSIZE=2048 VOL=SYSH01
put FILENAME

For more information, use "remotehelp" or "quote HELP".
==========================================================
I recommend "binary" mode and F or FB datasets only for migration to
HAL.  I don't know the ftp-hostname for HAL.  What you see in the
"ftp" command above is the SYSA name.

I have successfully done ftp from SYSA to lindy, and back.  So
migration of SYSA to SYSH could be done through lindy.

Do NOT try to move Edit-format datasets with FTP.  Instead, consider
doing SAVE on lindy from SYSA, and then from SYSH do a USE on lindy.
Most data moves just fine, but watch out for some special characters
that don't translate from EBCDIC to ASCII and back to EBCDIC again,
like x'FF'.

You can easily test by using FCOMPARE, as in this example:

Command> save %mydata on lindy
Command> fcompare active to %mydata on lindy

.* OPTION SUBMIT
.optix submit
Using SUBMIT in Y2K environment:
----------------------------------

SUBMIT basically works exactly the same on HAL as it does  on  SYSA.
The  documentation  for  using SUBMIT can be found by typing PUBLISH
and then selecting category 11 (Batch Processing and Tapes) and then
selecting document 18 (Using SUBMIT)

However, there are a couple of quirks regarding SUBMIT on HAL.   The
most  serious  problem  is  that when time jumps forward, the SKIP=n
parameter losses track of where it is.  The SKIP parameter  requires
a  START=  and  a SKIP= at the time it is originally submitted.  The
job runs first on the start date, calculates the date  it  needs  to
run  again  (e.g.  tomorrow if SKIP=1) and sets the next run date to
that date.  When that date arrives, SUBMIT asks "is today the day  I
need  to run this job?" If yes, the job runs and a new next run date
is stored in the job record.

When time advances, SUBMIT bypasses all these jobs  since  the  next
run dates don't match and these jobs will never be submitted again.

So, one fix to this problem is to "prime" the submit file  with  new
next  run  dates.   These  dates will vary depending on what the IPL
date is.  For example a SKIP=5  might  be  1/3/2000  if  we  IPL  on
12/31/1999.   The  same job may need to be set to 2/2/2000 if we IPL
on 1/30/2000.  This priming must happen  after  an  IPL  and  before
AUTOSUBP runs (this is the job that processes the SUBMIT file and it
runs on account GG.SUB).

Thus, as part of the shutdown in current time and right  before  the
IPL  it  is  important  to cancel and purge the AUTOSUBP job that is
awaiting execution for tomorrow.  Otherwise when HAL is IPL'd  in  a
future date, the AUTOSUBP job in the queue will immediately begin to
execute before any priming can take place.

Users should not need to be aware that a "priming"  task  is  taking
place.

Questions or concerns, contact Bill Bauriedel

.*OPTION NJE
.optix nje
Batch Job Using NJE
-------------------

A batch job can send data between machines  via  Network  Job  Entry
(NJE).   NJE  is  what transmits jobs between systems; that is, when
you submit a job on SYSA to run on SYSB, you are using NJE.   A  job
with  in-stream data (DD * or DD DATA) that is routed to a different
machine can move that data to the other machine.

The JCL in SYS3.SYSTEM.HALJCL(COPY#NJE) can be used to copy all  (or
selected) members of a PDS on SYSA to a PDS on SYSH and, in general,
can  be  used  in exactly the same way as job COPY#DSK can, but this
method works even when SYSH is in "future" mode.  See  the  comments
in the JCL instructions on how to change it.

This JCL can  be  a  bit  tricky,  but  you  don't  need  to  really
understand  it.   Just  be  careful when making the changes that you
don't  touch  (in  view  mode)  the  lines  with  the  undisplayable
characters in them.  If you're really interested in how this  works,
write to Mark Lawrence at m.lawrence@forsythe.

.* OPTION FTP
.optix ftp
WYLBUR FTP
----------

There is an FTP command in WYLBUR, but this feature has  never  been
documented  or  supported.   For  questions or concerns contact Mark
Lawrence (m.lawrence@forsythe).

IBM FTP
-------

There is an IBM-provided FTP program on both systems;  this  may  be
invoked  via  TSO  command  online,  via batch TSO or the catalogued
procedure FTP, or directly via PGM=FTP.  It supports the  "standard"
FTP commands and features.  Its use is not recommended.

Specific known problems:  in non-binary mode it translates all  data
to  and  from  ASCII  as it goes from one EBCDIC machine to another,
thus trashing special characters and binary data.  In  binary  mode,
it treats data as a byte stream and destroys the record structure of
the  original data.  So, you can't copy an EDIT-format data set, nor
can you copy an IEB-COPY-unloaded PDS, so it would be unwise to copy
a load library.

You could probably use FTP for copying source files, JCL, and  other
plan text stuff, provided it's in a card-format dataset.


.* OPTION DATA MOVE EXAMPLE
.optix data move example
Data Move Example:
------------------

1) Logon to SYSA.  ALLOCate a PDS ON SCRH00 using some temporary name.
   This creates an empty PDS.  For example:
    ALLOC JUST.ALLOC.PDS ON SCRH00

2) Run an IOPROGM job similar to the following:
   //copy job
   // exec ioprogm
   //in1 dd dsn=wyl.gg.uuu.PDSTOBE.COPIED,disp=old
   //out1 dd dsn=wyl.gg.uuu.JUST.ALLOC.PDS,disp=old

3) Logon on HAL. ALLOCate a PDS on STRH00 (or some other permanent volume)
   with the permanent name you want.  For example:
    ALLOC PDSTOBE.COPIED

4) Catalog the new copy you ran on SYSA as a HAL dataset on SCRH00.  For
   example:
    CAT JUST.ALLOC.PDS ON SCRH00

5) Run an IOPROGM job similar to the following:
   //copy job
   // exec ioprogm
   //in1 dd dsn=wyl.gg.uuu.JUST.ALLOC.PDS,disp=old
   //out1 dd dsn=wyl.gg.uuu.PDSTOBE.COPIED,disp=(old,delete)

Remember to uncat the dsn created on SYSA.
