The Forsythe Mainframe is Retiring!
-----------------------------------

Effective December 31, 2003, the Forsythe mainframe computer will be retired.
Most current services will be curtailed or ended by October 2003. It is likely
that no one except users of the few administrative systems remaining on
Forsythe at that time will be able to logon to their personal accounts. (We
will be working during that period to move the remaining systems and will be
unable to support other users.) Additionally, most Forsythe users who work only
with Prism applications such as SUFIN or Forms Action may be able to use
general access Prism, which does not require owning a personal Forsythe
account.

In other words, most people who still need to use the Forsythe mainframe no
longer need a Forsythe account.

How to get HELP
---------------
Most questions you will have are probably answered on our website, which gives
instructions for how to evaluate, examine and close your Forsythe account:

for Account Services to close your account right away, contact Forsythe Account
Services, phone 723-4795, email Account.Services@Forsythe.
