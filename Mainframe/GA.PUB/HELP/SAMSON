Samson

Samson is a computer program developed at Stanford.  It is available for the
IBM PC (called PC-Samson) and for the Apple Macintosh (MacSamson).  It makes a
microcomputer work as a terminal connected to the Forsythe mainframe computer
(located in Forsythe Hall) and allows you to transfer files between your
microcomputer and the Data Center.  Both versions also allow you to connect to
other host computers as well, emulating VT100 terminals.

Samson is easy to use; once you have loaded the program and logged on to the
Data Center.  you can move between your microcomputer and the Data Center with
ease.  Issuing a simple USE or SAVE command allows you to transfer files
between the two systems.

Basic Samson documentation and the diskettes containing the Samson program are
available from the Data Center's Account Services office in Spruce Hall. Though
they are free, you need to provide some blank diskettes in exchange.  For more
information about the exchange, including hours, call the Account Services
office before coming over: phone 723-4795.

You can print most Samson documentation using the PUBLISH command in WYLBUR.
