WHO name

The WHO command (also known as EMS WHO) queries the EMS Directory for
information.  The information in the directory is primarily names and
electronic mail addresses for people who use Forsythe or who are listed in
public distribution lists created in EMS.

The name can be a person's last name:

    Command> who smith

or some portion of a name:

    Command> whois benn

You can also see the members of a public distribution list by naming it in the
WHO command.

Basically WHO simply does an associative range search against a large data set
for the character string you specify, responding with the name and electronic
mail addresses of each person in whose listing a match was found.

Type HELP WHOIS for information on a related command that queries a larger,
University-wide data base on another computer.
