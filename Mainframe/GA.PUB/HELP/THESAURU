THESAURUS term [collect-options]

The THESAURUS command sends a request across the SUNet network to a dictionary
server on a NeXT machine maintained by the Computer Science department.  You
can use THESAURUS to get synonym and antonym information for individual words.
The thesaurus used is Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus, published by
Merriam-Webster, Inc.

If the word exists in the thesaurus, it will be listed along with synonyms
and, often, a dictionary definition, related words and antonyms, like this:

  Command> thesaurus recalcitrant

  recalcitrant adj
   Syn: UNRULY 1, fractious, indomitable, intractable, undisciplinable,
  undisciplined, ungovernable, unmanageable, untoward, wild
   Rel: obstinate, stubborn; opposing, resisting, withstanding
   Ant: amenable

If the word does not exist in the thesaurus, the program will probably
suggest some other words with a similar spelling (in case you misspelled the
word), which you can use in a new THESAURUS command.

Because the THESAURUS information is stored on another computer, the Stanford
Data Center cannot guarantee that the command will be available at all times.
If you receive a message that THESAURUS is unavailable, please try again later.

Type HELP WEBSTER for information on the related WEBSTER command.
