WYLBUR commands are described in this reference manual through explanation and
formal syntax.  The general form of a WYLBUR command is:

   command-word  positional-options  keyword-options; comments

When you issue a WYLBUR command, you must specify positional options in the
order shown, while you can specify keyword options in any order.

Separate all options from each other and the command word by at least one
separator.  Blank, equal sign (=), and comma (,) are all equivalent
separators.

If you specify a character string containing an apostrophe (') as an option,
you must enclose the string in quotation marks (").  If the string contains
quotation marks ("), you must enclose it in apostrophes (').  The following
examples of the LIST command illustrate both of these conditions:

   LIST "John's"

   LIST 'He said, "WYLBUR is great."'

Otherwise, when using a character string as an option, you may enclose it in
either apostrophes or quotation marks.

Separate any comments in a command from the rest of the command by a
semicolon.  WYLBUR ignores comments; you use them to document commands in EXEC
files.  Note that the TO and SEND commands do not allow comments.

Command syntax (the notation used to express the exact form of a command)
follows a set of common conventions in all WYLBUR documentation.  The examples
below, the command syntax for the SET CURRENT command and the SET MAIL
command, clarify the explanation of command syntax that follows them.

   SET {CURRENT|*} [line-number] [EXECUTE]

   SET MAIL [gg.uuu] [FORWARD {uuu|gg.uuu}|NOFORWARD] ['message']
            [collect-options] [QUIET]

  - When there is a choice among the options for a command, alternatives are
    separated by the "or" symbol (|).

  - Alternatives from which you must select only one are enclosed by braces
    ({}).

  - Alternatives from which you may select one, or which you can omit
    entirely, are enclosed by square brackets ([]).

  - Never type braces, brackets, and the "or" symbol (|) as part of a command.
    They are for syntax explanation only.

  - Substitute a value for words or phrases shown in lowercase in the command
    syntax.

  - Type words or letters that appear in UPPERCASE in the command syntax as
    they are shown.  (Do not substitute a value for them.)\ You can type them
    in upper- or lowercase and some of them may be abbreviated.  (See Appendix
    A on abbreviations.)\

  - Type the following set of special characters exactly as shown in the
    command syntax:

       apostrophe            '         period         .
       asterisk              *         minus sign     -
       comma                 ,         plus sign      +
       equal sign            =         slash          /
       parentheses          ()         number sign    #
       quotation marks       "

  - You may use a blank in place of an equal sign (=) or a comma (,) (although
    the equal sign or comma may make a command easier to read).
