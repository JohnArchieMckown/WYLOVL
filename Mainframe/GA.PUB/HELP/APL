.cm Added on 12/02/80 by LSO
APL is an interactive programming language.  A number of online reference aids
and documents have been stored in a WYLBUR library named DOC, that belong to
the APL instructional account, SI.APL.  The first of a small set of
self-documenting files may be obtained by entering the following WYLBUR
commands:

   Command> use wyl.si.apl.doc#help on cat clr
   Command> list

The library just mentioned may be accessed 'safely' from any terminal.
However, since APL employs its own unique character set and command language,
you should not CALL APL unless you have some familiarity with local use of the
language.
