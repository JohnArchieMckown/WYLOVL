UPDATE

UPDATE is a data set that contains useful information about the ITS system and
facilities, in addition to articles that augment items in NEWS.

You can access UPDATE by one of the following methods:

   1.\Use an EXEC file that either prompts you for each article or provides a
      list of article titles.  The command:

           EXECUTE FROM LIB#UPDATE PUBLIC

      expedites your access to the articles in UPDATE.  You can choose the
      article you are interested in and then indicate whether you want to read
      it or print a copy of it.

      The command:

           EXECUTE FROM LIB#UPDATE PUBLIC PARM='SUMMARY'

      provides you with a list of the article titles.

   2.\Put the UPDATE data set in your active file by issuing the command:

           USE DOC#UPDATE PUBLIC

      Information about how to access and read the articles in UPDATE is
      included at the beginning of the data set.

All articles in UPDATE are also archived in a public SPIRES file called NEWS
ARCHIVE (this file also stores all the NEWS articles).  To access NEWS
ARCHIVE, issue the following commands:

   Command> CALL SPIRES
   -> SELECT NEWS ARCHIVE

Once you have selected NEWS ARCHIVE, you can search the file by words that
appear in the item's TITLE, by KEYWORD (words in the text) or by the SOURCE of
the article (NEWS or UPDATE).  Once you have found the pertinent items, you
can display them in the familiar news format by using the TYPE command.

To read the items in NEWS, type USE NEWS PUBLIC.  The printed Bulletin,
published quarterly, contains items from both NEWS and UPDATE, besides
articles of a more global or program-oriented nature.  Articles in the printed
Bulletin can be accessed online with the command:  USE BULLETIN#EXPLAIN
PUBLIC.
