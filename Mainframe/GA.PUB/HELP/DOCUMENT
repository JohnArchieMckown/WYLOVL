Documents

Most Data Center documents are available through the PUBLISH command, which
lets you order documents for printing on Data Center printers.  Type HELP
PUBLISH for more information.  Note that PUBLISH can give you the data set name
of the publishable manual, so you may be able to read or scan the document
online.  Ask for instructions at the start of your PUBLISH session.

Many documents, including some not available through PUBLISH, are available
for free from the Information Desk in Forsythe Hall.

Some documentation is also contained in the online library DOC.  Each member of
the library contains information on a specific subject, e.g.  rates, machine
and staff schedules, recent WYLBUR changes, etc.  To get any member, issue the
command:

     USE DOC#member PUBLIC

where "member" is the specific member containing the information you want.  To
see a list of members, type the command SHOW DIRECTORY IN DOC PUBLIC.

HELP also provides information about other online documentation via the
following commands:

     HELP EXEC FILES       describes PUBLIC EXEC files that perform a
                           variety of useful functions.

     HELP NEWS             describes the online NEWS facility and how to
                           access it.

     HELP UPDATE           describes how to access UPDATE, a data set that
                           contains useful information about the Data Center's
                           system and facilities, in addition to articles that
                           augment NEWS.
