Online Consulting (CONSULT-BY-MAIL) provides technical consulting
advice through electronic mail.

Once you issue the CONSULT command, you are prompted with a list of
subjects.  After making a selection, you collect your consulting
query in the active file.  Your query is then automatically routed
to the appropriate consultant.  A reply should reach you by WYLBUR
mail within two working days.
