SCRIPT

SCRIPT is a text formatting program developed by the University of Waterloo
for use in computer-assisted preparation and revision of manuscripts of all
types.  It provides automatic right margin justification and hyphenation, page
numbering, insertion of headings, placement of footnotes, multi-column page
layout, box drawing, table of contents production, and aids to indexing.
While SCRIPT is easy to use for short documents, such as memos, it is most
helpful in the preparation of large documents such as manuals, theses, and
research publications, which undergo repeated revisions.

GML (Generalized Markup Language) is an extension of SCRIPT that provides a
set of predefined commands for automating various components of a document,
such as an index, table of contents, and chapter and section headings.

SCRIPT runs as a batch job.  A public EXEC file automatically constructs the
JCL and submits the SCRIPT batch job for you.  Issue the command:

     SCRIPT [filename]

If you want to use SCRIPT interactively, another Public EXEC file, SCRIPTI, is
available.  Issue the command:

     UTIL SCRIPTI

You can obtain documentation on SCRIPT via the PUBLISH command.

Help for SCRIPT control words is available via WYLBUR HELP.  Type the command

     HELP SCRIPT [command]

to get help on individual SCRIPT commands.
