FOLIO

Folio is an online system that provides computerized access to information at
Stanford.  For example, through Folio you can search Socrates (Stanford's
online library catalog) and JOBS (information about open staff positions at
Stanford) and many other files.  Folio is a cooperative effort between
Information Resources, the Libraries of Stanford, and other campus offices.

Folio is very easy to use.  No computer experience is required -- just read
the instructions on the screen to find out what to do next.

You may search Folio free of charge at publicly available Folio terminals on
campus.  Most campus libraries have terminals for Socrates searching.

You can also search Folio from terminals or microcomputers in your dorm, home,
or office.  After logging on to the Data Center computer, type the command
FOLIO to enter Folio.  (Data Center accounts paid for by University funds will
not be charged for Folio use.)

If you don't want to use your regular Data Center account to search Folio, you
can obtain a free account designated for Folio searching by presenting your
Stanford ID at the Green Library Privileges Desk or at any of the offices
where public Folio terminals are located.

For more information about Folio, contact Bo Parker, phone 723-3743.
