JCL

JCL (Job Control Language) is a special language used to submit a job to the
batch system.  JCL describes to the system which program or language you will
use (e.g., FORTRAN, SPSS) and the attributes of data sets you want processed,
as well as what activities you want the computer to perform (e.g., compile,
compile and link).

To submit a job, you place JCL pertinent to the task you want to perform in
your active file.  Then, issue the RUN command to submit that JCL to the batch
system.
