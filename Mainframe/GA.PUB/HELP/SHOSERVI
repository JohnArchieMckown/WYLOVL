.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW SERVICE command reports the current status of various Data Center
services, from printing to software.  SHOW SERVICE provides the following
status information:

   - unscheduled service changes

   - scheduled services available

   - scheduled services that are running with limitations


The format of the service status information is as follows:

     service name  [(related services)]
     Status as of {time} {day} {date}
       {status information}

For example:

     4090 Laser Printer   (Related services are: BOND,3HOL,BLUE)
     Status as of 1600 Mon. 0/01/93
       Normal status.   See DOC#SCHEDULE PUBLIC for details.


The SHOW SERVICE command is menu driven but the menus can be easily overrided
by requesting the information  directly from the command prompt.  For example:

   SHOW SERVICE 4090

will display information on the service component, 4090.

To get information about a service status for all components, you could type
any of the following commands depending upon the type of service status you
wanted to view:

   SHOW SERVICE IN
   SHOW SERVICE OUT
   SHOW SERVICE REDUCED
   SHOW SERVICE ALL
