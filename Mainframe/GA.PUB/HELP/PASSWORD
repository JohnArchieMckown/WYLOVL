Password

Your password is the primary mechanism that keeps others from using your ITS
account.  No one can use a particular account without knowing both the account
and the associated password.

You choose your password; it consists of a string of any alphanumeric
characters and it can be 5 to 8 characters in length.  You enter it each time
you logon, in response to the "Password?" prompt, and you should change it the
first time you logon to your account and at least every two weeks thereafter.

You use the SET PASSWORD command to change your password.  (Type HELP SET
PASSWORD for a description of the command.)\
