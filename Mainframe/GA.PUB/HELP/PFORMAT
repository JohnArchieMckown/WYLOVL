PFORMATs

A PFORMAT is a special page format on the Xerox 4090 printer.  PFORMATs may be
requested on PRINT commands or JOBPARM statements of JCL.  Specifying PFORMAT
designates the character set to be used and the vertical lines per inch
spacing, thus overriding any FCB or CHARS option which may also specified.
Available page formats include:

     L132\\\\\\Landscape mode, 132 columns, 8 lines per inch.

     L150\\\\\\Landscape mode, 150 columns, 8 lines per inch.

     PD132\\\\\Portrait mode, double page, 132 columns; this format prints two
               60 line landscape mode page images on a single portrait mode
               page side.

     PD150\\\\\Portrait mode, double page, 150 columns; format like PD132,
               except with a smaller character set that prints 150 columns
               across the page, in uppercase only.

     L120\\\\\\120 characters per line (12 pitch, 1/2 inch left margin).

     L1206\\\\\same, at 6 lines per inch.

     LTN128\\\\120 characters per line (like L120 but with CHARS=TN12).

     LTN126\\\\same, at 6 lines per inch.

     L165\\\\\\165 characters per line (15 pitch, no left margin).

     L100\\\\\\100 characters per line (10 pitch, 1/2 inch left margin).

     L200\\\\\\200 characters per line (20 pitch uppercase only).

Landscape mode causes text to be printed with the lines parallel to the long
side of the page (like FORMS=1181).  Portrait mode causes text to be printed
with lines parallel to the short side of the page (like FORMS=9511).
