.item PROGRAM ERROR 'Added on 05/14/91 by JNK'
If you receive a PROGRAM ERROR message, then the ORVYL program you
were using (for example, SPIRES or Prism) has encountered a problem
that has stopped it from running as usual.  The error is a problem
for the program's programming staff to figure out; it it not your
fault.

The programming staff has been notified of the problem.  Depending
on their evaluation, they may contact you for more information.

For now, you may want to try your work again, starting over from
the point where you invoked the ORVYL program that had the error.
