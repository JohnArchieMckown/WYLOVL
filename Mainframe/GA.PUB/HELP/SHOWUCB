SHOW UCB {uuuu|uuu|vvvvvv} [HEX|INTERNAL]

Display information from the MVS Unit Control Block (UCB) for an I/O
device such as a disk volume, tape drive, or printer.

uuuu     The four-digit hexadecimal address of the device, or
uuu      the three-digit form, for devices that can be addressed with
         three digits.

vvvvvv   The six-character volume serial number of the volume that is
         mounted on the device.  This form can only be used for disk
         volumes that are online, or for tape volumes that are mounted.

HEX      Returns the UCB address (four bytes), plus the base segment and
         the common extension (48 bytes), as hexadecimal data.

INTERNAL Returns the device information in a fixed format record:
