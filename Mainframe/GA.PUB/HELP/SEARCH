.* DESCRIPTION
SEARCH is a command that will give you access to data bases of general
interest to the Stanford community, such as library catalogs, directories, and
schedules.

While most data bases are implemented using SPIRES, no knowledge of SPIRES is
necessary to use most of these collections.  The system will guide you through
searching, if you'd like it to.

Currently, only "Socrates" is available through the SEARCH command.  (Type
HELP SEARCH SOCRATES for information on Socrates.)\

.* OPTION SOCRATES
SOCRATES\\\\\\\\gives you access to the public online catalog of the libraries
                of Stanford University.  Socrates includes information about
                materials acquired at Stanford libraries after 1972
                (Coordinate libraries after 1976), including information about
                all materials in Meyer Library.  Over 900,000 items are cited
                in Socrates.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Socrates is available for free use to patrons in Green, Meyer,
                Falconer (Biology) and Engineering libraries.  It is also
                available from any ITS account on the 3081A.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Socrates can provide computer-guided searching, for the new or
                inexperienced user.  No previous experience with WYLBUR or
                SPIRES is necessary.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Complete online HELP is available once in Socrates.  A
                reference guide card is available free at the libraries and in
                Forsythe Document Sales; a user's guide is in preparation.
