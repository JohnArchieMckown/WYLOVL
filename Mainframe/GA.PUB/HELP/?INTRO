How to LOGON and LOGOFF
-----------------------

At the beginning of every terminal session you must identify yourself to the
computer with your account and your password.  This action is called a logon.
Leaving the computer system is called a logoff.  The logon sequence after the
computer connection is established should look like this (press the RETURN key
after each response):

   Stanford University Network (SUN):  Welcome to the 3081 [Port 11C-YH2.06]

   [Any general message from the operator will appear here.]

   Account? gg.uuu "your name"     <-- Your 3081 account followed by your name
                                       in quotes (name is optional).

   Password? xxxxxxxx              <-- Your password; it will either disappear
                                       as you type it or be hidden by other
                                       characters or, on some terminals, it
                                       will be displayed.
.* PROMPT 'Continue'

   [If a NEWS article has been released since you last logged on, and you have
   AUTO NEWS set, you will be asked at this point if you want to read it.]

   [If you have a Logon EXEC file, WYLBUR will execute it here.]

   Command>                        <-- You can now enter WYLBUR commands.

It is possible to provide all the logon information in response to the first
question:

   Account? gg.uuu "your name" / xxxxxxxx

A response of just ? to any of the logon questions will give you a brief
description of the allowed responses.

Once logged on, you may begin work.  When you have completed your work and you
are ready to logoff, issue the command:

.* PROMPT 'Continue'
   Command> logoff
   OK TO CLEAR? ok                 <-- This question is asked only if there is
                                        something in your active file.  Type
                                        OK to clear your active file.  Type NO
                                        if you do not wish your active file
                                        cleared.  Your active file will
                                        automatically be saved and you will be
                                        logged off.  If you decide you want to
                                        stop the procedure and remain logged
                                        on, press the BREAK key and the logoff
                                        process will be aborted.

   WYLBUR: 0.55 CPU SECONDS, 20 DISK I/O'S          These statistics are the

How to get HELP
---------------

The online HELP facility provides details about the WYLBUR commands, as well
as explanations of some terminology and guides to further assistance.

The following commands provide lists of the commands and topics that are
currently available in HELP.  (The lists are updated as additions are made.)\

     HELP COMMANDS   lists the commands available in HELP.

     HELP SET        lists the SET commands available in HELP.

     HELP SHOW       lists the SHOW commands available in HELP.

     HELP TOPICS     lists the topics available in HELP.

For a description of how to use the HELP command, type:

     HELP HELP

.* PROMPT 'Do you want information about HELP error message explanations'

The online HELP facility includes explanations for error messages.  When
WYLBUR issues an error message in response to an aborted command, you can get
an explanation of that message by responding to the next command prompt with a
question mark.  For example, if you issue a LIST command and specify a line
number that is not in your active file:

   Command> list 50
   Line 50 not in file.
   Command> ?
   The error message "Line <n> not in file" or "Lines <m>/<n> not in file" is
   given when you issue a command with an explicit range option (e.g., LIST
   8/12) and the line (or lines) you specified are not in your active
   file.
