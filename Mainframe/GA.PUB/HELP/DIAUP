Dialing-up

To use the IBM 3090 computer at Forsythe from a remote location, you
must connect your terminal via a telephone (or dial-up) line and use
one of the following phone numbers:

   300 or 1200 bps connections:                723-8012
       (on-campus)                               3-8012
   2400 bps connections                        723-8000
       (on-campus)                               3-8000
   MNP error correction 300, 1200 or 2400      723-8001
       (on-campus)                               3-8001

Modems
------
When using a telephone line, you also need a modem; it modulates the
electrical impulses from your terminal into audio signals that can be sent
over the telephone line and demodulates the phone line signals for your
terminal.

There are two types of modems:  acoustic coupled and direct coupled.  An
acoustic coupled modem uses an acoustic coupler (a small, oval-shaped piece of
equipment with two rubber cups that hold a telephone handset) to communicate
over a telephone line.  The direct coupled modem connects directly to a
telephone line (via the telephone wall jack); it has either autodial or a
telephone attached to it that is used for dialing.

Terminal Settings
-----------------
Before connecting, make sure your terminal's option settings match those
required by the IBM 3084 computer.  Consult the manual for your terminal for
instructions on setting options.  The ITS system requires the following
options:

   ONLINE/LOCAL   -- Set to ONLINE

   Parity         -- Set to EVEN

   Character size -- Set to 7 data bits, 1 parity bit

   Stop bits      -- Set to 1

   Speed          -- Can be 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, or 9600  bits per
                     second (bps) depending on the type of terminal
                     connection you have.  Speeds used on dial-up
                     connections are typically either 300 or 1200
                     bps.  On direct connections your speed may be
                     300, 1200, 2400, 4800, or 9600 bps.

   ECHO/NOECHO    -- Set to NOECHO (or "full duplex" on some terminals).

Logging On With a Dial-Up Line
------------------------------
Once you have the appropriate terminal and modem setup, follow this procedure
to logon using a dial-up line:

   1.  Turn on your terminal and your modem.

   2.  If you are using a direct coupled modem, follow the manufacturer's
       directions for connecting and skip to step 5 of this procedure.

   3.  If you are using an acoustic coupled modem, pick up your telephone and
       dial 328-4000 or ext.\3-0045.  Wait for an answer and a high-pitched
       tone.

   4.  Once you receive an answer and a high-pitched tone, complete the data
       connection by placing the telephone receiver into the coupler.

   5.  Press the RETURN key; the following prompt should appear:

     enter class

   Type 20 and press the RETURN key.  The message "class start" should
   appear followed by the ITS system logon heading.  If the ITS logon heading
   does not appear within a few seconds, press the RETURN key again.  When the
   logon heading appears, it will be followed by prompts for your ITS account
   and password.  Once you enter your account and password, the logon
   procedure is complete.

Note that if you get a busy signal when dialing either 723-8000 or
723-8012, it means that all the computer ports are currently in use.
If there is ringing and no answer, the computer is currently
unavailable.
