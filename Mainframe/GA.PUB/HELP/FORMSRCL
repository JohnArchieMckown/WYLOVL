RECALLING FORMS

You may receive notification that University forms you created in Prism have
not been acted upon or have not been completed by a particular date.
You may wish to RECALL these forms in order to re-route them to another list of
approvers (or to make other modifications to the form).

To recall forms:
   1. Type PRISM//SELECT FORMS ACTION    (Leave EMS, if necessary, before
        typing this command.)
   2. Enter your name and PIN (Personal Identification Number) when
       requested.
   3. Type ENTRY
   4. You'll then see a numbered list of forms eligible for recall.  Type GET
        number, where "number" is the number of the form you want to recall.
   5. Type "yes" in the space provided.  Then issue the SEND command to
        transmit your recall request to Prism.

When you have recalled a form, you may then select the file in which you
originally created the form, in order to modify the form and re-route it.
