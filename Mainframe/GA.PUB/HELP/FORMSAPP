APPROVING FORMS

After you receive notification that an online form awaits your approval or
acknowledgment, you can take action on the form by typing this command:

 PRISM//SELECT FORMS ACTION         <--(Leave EMS, if necessary, before
                                       typing this command)

The command above takes you directly into the Prism file Forms Action and shows
you a "signature folder" of forms awaiting your approval or acknowledgment.

In addition to showing you a summary of each form, Forms Action gives you
simple instructions on how to take action on the form -- you can approve the
form quickly or examine it in detail before taking action on it.

For more information on online approval, please use the SUGGEST facility in
Prism to request copies of our guides and help cards on University forms.

You will need a University ID and PIN to take advantage of online approval.
Contact Records and Systems in Personnel if you do not now have an ID or PIN.
