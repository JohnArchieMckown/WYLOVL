SOCRATES

Socrates is the online catalog of Stanford University's libraries. It contains
information about library materials acquired since 1973 (for some libraries,
since 1977), as well as all items in Meyer Library.  Socrates contains over
1.2 million citations and is constantly expanding.  Terminals for free Socrates
searching are available at Green, Meyer, and other libraries.  A short
reference guide explaining Socrates further is available within the libraries
or through Document Sales at Forsythe Hall.

Access to Socrates is provided by a system called Folio.  In addition to
Socrates, Folio includes information about other academic and institutional
data resources at Stanford.  For example, the Odyssey file contains information
about internships and research opportunities for Stanford students.

You do not need any computer experience to search Folio.  Online help is
available at every step, and a guided, menu-driven search mode teaches new
users how to begin.

Students, faculty, and staff can obtain a free account for searching Folio
outside the library by visiting the Green Library Privileges Desk or various
branch libraries.  In addition, anyone who is able to log onto the Data Center
can enter Folio at any time by issuing the command FOLIO.  (Data Center
accounts paid for by University funds will not be charged for Folio use.)
The free use of Folio will be in effect for the duration of Project Concourse,
a three-year Stanford/IBM study in electronic communication ending in 1988.
