TELL {server-name AT node|server-name@node} message
.boxoff

.* DESCRIPTION
This command provides a VM/CMS compatible syntax (first form) for sending
command messages to BITNET server machines.  The second form provides
compatibility with $SEND, the native command required for such actions.  Note
that TELL (or $SEND) should only be used for talking to server machines.  TO
is the appropriate command for interactive messages intended for real end
users on all BITNET machines which can handle interactive communications.  TO
will insert additional information at the front of your message which will
confuse most servers.

Note that SEND (as opposed to $SEND) does not send an interactive message but
rather sends mail where the full message text is placed in the SUBJECT header
rather than as a separate body after the headers.
