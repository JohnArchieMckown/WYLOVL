MASTERLIST

MASTERLIST is an online index to the ITS Program Library.  It includes some
2,200 records for subroutines, closed programs, control card setups, SPIRES
protocols, and WYLBUR EXEC files.  Each record gives the program name, an
abstract and other important information (location of the source code, memory
required, etc.).

To use MASTERLIST, issue the following commands:

   Command> CALL SPIRES
   -> SELECT MASTERLIST
   -> SHOW SEARCH TERMS

Once you have selected MASTERLIST, you can search the file using the FIND
command and a search term (e.g., FIND NAME IOPROGM).  Then you can display the
information at your terminal by issuing the TYPE command.
