ORVYL/SORT

ORVYL/SORT is an easy and efficient method of sorting lines in the WYLBUR
active file.  You put the lines to be sorted in your active file and issue the
following command:

     CALL SORT

SORT reads each line from the active file, clears the active file, and writes
the sorted lines back into the active file.  The sorted lines are renumbered.
By default, the entire active file is sorted in ascending standard EBCDIC
character collating sequence using each entire line beginning in column 1.

You can specify a range of lines to be sorted with the LINES option, for
example:

     CALL SORT(LINES=10/20)

The SORT FIELDS option allows you to indicate specific columns, ascending or
descending sequence, and hexadecimal or character set data type, for example:

     CALL SORT(10)              <-- Sorts in ascending sequence using columns
                                    10 through 235.

     CALL SORT(D,LINES=50/90)   <-- Sorts lines 50/90 in columns 1 through
                                    235 in descending sequence.

     CALL SORT(HEX)             <-- Sorts in ascending sequence; active file
                                    contains only hexadecimal data.
