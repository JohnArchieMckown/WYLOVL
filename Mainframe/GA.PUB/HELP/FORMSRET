RETURNED FORMS

When you receive notification that a form you originated has been returned for
changes, here is how to reroute the form:

 1. Enter PRISM and SELECT the file where you originated the form.
    (This file is listed in the notification message you received.)

 2. Retrieve the form with a search.  (Use a search such as FIND
    STATUS = RETURNED, if possible.)

 3. GET the form and make the necessary changes in the data.

 4. Type SEND in order to modify the routing page on the form.  After
    filling out the routing, type SEND again to reroute the form.

The person returning the form has probably attached a remark explaining changes
needed.  To see this remark, you may need to retrieve the form in the Prism
file Forms Action.  For more details on University forms, please use SUGGEST in
Prism to request the latest copies of our introductory guides.
