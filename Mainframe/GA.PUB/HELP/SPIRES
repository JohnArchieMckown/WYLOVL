SPIRES

SPIRES (Stanford Public Information REtrieval System) is a generalized data
base management system that allows you to create, own and manage your own
collections of data, known as data bases.  It is designed to handle all types
of data efficiently, from compact, numerical values found in administrative
and scientific data to lengthy, textual values such as bibliographic data.

In addition to creating a private file for your own use, you may be interested
in a number of public SPIRES files:  MASTERLIST, a file on all programs
maintained in the Program Library; RESTAURANT, a file on local restaurants; and
RECIPES, a file containing recipes developed or discovered by users of the
Forsythe computer.  Many important University data bases are maintained in
SPIRES but may not be available to you there.  Many of them are available
through Prism, however -- type HELP PRISM for more information.

To enter SPIRES, issue the command SPIRES.  Once you are in SPIRES, the
command EXPLAIN provides further assistance.  For example, try EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING or EXPLAIN SPIRES.  You can also get a complete list of the public
SPIRES files by issuing the command SHOW PUBLIC SUBFILES. To leave SPIRES,
type the EXIT command.
