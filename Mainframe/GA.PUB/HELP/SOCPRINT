SOCRATES Printing
At the prompt "Name of printed copy:" enter the name that you assigned in
Socrates to your printed copy and press the RETURN key.  Your copy will be
printed immediately.  When printing is complete, you will see a message to
that effect on this screen. If you used the same name for several printed
copies, all of the copies will print when you enter the name at the prompt.

If you have forgotten the name of your printed copy, type LOCATE at the prompt
to see a list of all jobs waiting to be printed.  Here is an example:
   Name of printed copy:  locate
   10:57    JLS1    - 35 Brief citations    <the name is JLS1>
   10:59    JLS2    - 1 Full citation       <the name is JLS2>
   14:32    BURGESS - 10 headings           <the name is BURGESS>
   14:35    BURGESS - 5 Full citations      <the name is BURGESS>
If the list is long, the display will pause after the screen is filled.  Press
RETURN to see the rest of the display.  The command LOCATE JLS will display a
list of all print jobs with names beginning with the characters "JLS".

If you see the message "Job ____ not found" your copy may have been printed
already.  Check the area around the printer or ask for assistance.
