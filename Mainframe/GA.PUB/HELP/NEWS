NEWS

NEWS is a public data set that contains important items about changes or
additions to the Forsythe system.  When you logon, WYLBUR displays titles of
articles from NEWS.  The system remembers items you have read, so only new
titles are displayed.  This feature provides an easy way to stay informed of
system changes.

If you have turned off the automatic NEWS facility (with the SET AUTO NONEWS
command) but still wish to be alerted when there is recent NEWS, you can add
the following line to your Logon EXEC file:

     IF (INDEX(PARM,'NEWS') NE 0) COMMENT READ YOUR NEWS

The message READ YOUR NEWS will appear whenever you logon if there is NEWS you
have not read.  Use the SHOW NEWS command to read those items any time during
the session.

As NEWS items are added to NEWS PUBLIC, they are also archived in a public
SPIRES file called NEWS ARCHIVE.  (NEWS ARCHIVE is also used to store UPDATE
articles.  Type HELP\UPDATE for a description of UPDATE.)\

To access NEWS ARCHIVE, issue the following commands:

   Command> spires
   -> select news archive

Once you have selected NEWS ARCHIVE, you can search the file by words that
appear in the item's TITLE, by KEYWORD (words in the text) or by the SOURCE of
the article (NEWS or UPDATE).  For example, issue the command FIND TITLE
CHILLED WATER.  Type HELP in SPIRES for more assistance.

Once you have found the pertinent items, you can display them in the familiar
news format by issuing the TYPE command.
