WEBSTER term [collect-options]

The WEBSTER command sends a request across the SUNet network to a dictionary
server on a NeXT machine maintained by the Computer Science department.  You
can use WEBSTER to get dictionary definitions and verify spellings of
individual words.  The dictionary used is Webster's Ninth New Collegiate
Dictionary, published by Merriam-Webster, Inc.   It includes biographical
and geographical name entries.

If the word exists in the dictionary, it will be listed along with
pronunciation and derivation details, and one or more definitions, like this:

  Command> webster shipper

  ship.per \'ship-<e>r\ n (1755)
      :one that sends goods by any form of conveyance

If the word does not exist in the dictionary, the program will probably
suggest some other words with a similar spelling, which you can use in a
new WEBSTER command.

The pronunciation transliteration follows complex rules -- the "<e>" in the
example stands for the schwa sound, for instance -- which would take several
hundred lines to explain.  For pronunciation help, your best bet is to consult
a printed dictionary.

Because the WEBSTER information is stored on another computer, the Forsythe
computer cannot guarantee that the command will be available at all times.
If you receive a message that WEBSTER is unavailable, please try again later.
