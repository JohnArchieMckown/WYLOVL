Hosts

You can send and receive electronic mail from any of several thousand computers
connected to the Forsythe computer via an electronic communications network.
Currently, the Forsythe computer is connected to BITNET, Internet, and the
Stanford University network (SUNet).

The WYLBUR command "MAIL TO user@host" can be used to send mail to another
computer (type HELP MAIL for more information on the MAIL command).

Some common SUNet host computers that many of our users send and receive
electronic mail from are:

     Host Name              Description

     MACBETH                Student Computing
     GSB-HOW, GSB-WHY       Stanford Business School
     RLG                    Research Libraries Group
     SAIL                   Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab
     SIERRA                 Electrical Engineering
     SUMEX-AIM              Stanford Medical Center

There is no general directory of SUNet hosts, as the list of computers
connected to the SUNet network is ever-changing.  If you need to find
electronic mail addresses at Stanford, try the WHO or WHOIS commands.
Otherwise, you will need to contact that person directly for the e-mail
address.

For a complete and up-to-date list of BITNET nodes, use the online file
DOC#BITNET PUBLIC.
