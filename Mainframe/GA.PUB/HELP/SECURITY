Security

The Stanford Data Center mainframe systems have access and security software
to allow authorized access and prevent unauthorized access to disk and tape
datasets.  For general information about security at Stanford, print from
DOC#SECURITY PUB.  For general information about using the access and security
software at the Data Center, print from DOC#PROTECT PUB.  For help about the
specific commands needed to manage access and security for your disk data type
HELP SET PROTECT, HELP SHOW PROTECT and/or HELP RACF.  For help about how to
manage access and security for your tape data type HELP SET TAPE and HELP SHOW
TAPE.

IBM's Resource Access Control Facility (RACF) is the software base that
provides dataset protection at the Data Center.  It is a profile based system
which is explained in the referenced documents.  Your account has a default
profile which can be overridden.  To see your default profile type SHOW
PROTECT DEFAULT.  You can change it with the SET PROTECT DEFAULT command.
