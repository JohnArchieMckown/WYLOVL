Prism is an online collection of Stanford administrative files and services.
The files have many different purposes, but share a common look and use the
same commands, so once you learn how to use one of them you have a head start
in learning all the other files.  After selecting a Prism file, you can use
it for looking up data (SEARCH activity); entering data or performing
processing tasks (ENTRY activity); and producing reports (REPORT activity).
Prism also lets you print output at many points within your session.

To enter Prism from WYLBUR, first set your terminal type (type HELP TERMINALS
for more information), then issue the PRISM command.  Online guidance within
Prism will help you select a file and accomplish your set of tasks.  If you
would like more information, a short document, Introduction to Prism, is
available through the PUBLISH command.
