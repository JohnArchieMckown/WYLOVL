FINGER name

The FINGER command lets you find out if someone is logged on, to almost any
computer on the SUNet network.

To find a particular person, put the user-id and the host computer they use on
the finger command:

    Command>  finger smith@jessica

Finger usually responds with information about when that account last logged
off.  The exact format and scope of the information varies from machine to
machine and account to account.

To see who is logged on to a particular computer, just put the @host-name
after the finger command:

    Command>  finger @jessica

This gives a list of the currently logged on accounts on that computer.

The FINGER information is actually sends a request over the SUNet network to
the computer in question.  If you receive a message such as "Connection
refused" when you try the FINGER command, it usually means that the other
computer is not accepting requests or the link between computers is not
functioning.
