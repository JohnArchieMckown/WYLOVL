.* PROMPT 'Do you want information about HELP error message explanations'

The online HELP facility includes explanations for error messages.  When
WYLBUR issues an error message in response to an aborted command, you can get
an explanation of that message by responding to the next command prompt with a
question mark.  For example, if you issue a LIST command and specify a line
number that is not in your active file:

   Command> list 50
   Line 50 not in file.
   Command> ?
   The error message "Line <n> not in file." or "Lines <m>/<n> not in file." is
   given when you issue a command with an explicit range option (e.g., LIST
   8/12) and the line (or lines) you specified are not in your active
   file.
