BITNET

BITNET (Because It's Time Network) is a nationwide network linking over 1000
universities and research institutions to provide an easy to use, fast,
economical, and effective means of exchanging information.

To send information to a colleague at another institution, you must know the
recipient's user identification code and the node ID (the identification code
of the computer that is ultimately to receive your message - some
installations have more than one node; node identification codes are listed in
DOC#BITNET PUBLIC).

When sending a message, collect the text in your active file and then type the
MAIL or EMS SM command.  For example:

   MAIL TO userid@nodeid

MAIL messages may not exceed 200 lines.  To send larger files, use either of
the commands:

   PRINT TO userid@nodeid
   PUNCH TO userid@nodeid

(Type HELP PRINT or HELP PUNCH for more details.)\

When you mail files containing lines longer than 80 characters, the long lines
are split into two separate lines.  To send lines longer than 80 characters
without wrapping, use the PRINT TO command instead of the MAIL TO command.

You may also send a one line message using the SEND command:

   SEND userid@nodeid

For an immediate, interactive message, use the TO command:

   TO userid@nodeid text of message

A TO message may not exceed 80 characters, including the TO userid@nodeid
characters and the recipient must be logged on to receive the message.

When receiving messages, your BITNET user identification code is your Data
Center account number in the form gg.uuu and the node identification is
STANFORD.

You are notified of a message the same way you receive notification of on
campus messages.

Files containing information about BITNET and BITNET hosts are stored in the
library BITNET PUBLIC.  Type SHOW DIRECTORY FOR BITNET PUBLIC to see a
listing.  See "Using BITNET," available from the PUBLISH facility, for more
details.
