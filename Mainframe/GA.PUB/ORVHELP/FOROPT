The format options allow you to specify three attributes of the data set:

   1.\record format and length, using LRECL, etc.

   2.\WYLBUR line number format, using NUMBERED, etc.

They are meaningful in the commands GET and PUT.

If you do not specify a format, ORVYL saves disk files in EDIT format (i.e.,
EDIT is the default format).  Once you have created a disk file with the
desired format, ORVYL automatically recognizes the format for GET commands
and PUT...REPLACE commands.

Special caution must be used when specifying an explicit format for saving
library members.  (Type HELP LIBRARY for a definition of library.)\ The format
attributes apply to the entire ORVYL user library and not the library members
individually.  Thus, if the format of the member does not agree with that of
the library, ORVYL issues a warning message like the following:

     Warning: Data set type will be changed to PO U/6356/6356
     OK (Yes/No)?

If you reply OK, YES or Y, ORVYL changes the format of the library to the
specified format.  However, the new format attributes of the library may not
reflect the actual format attributes of the older library members.  Thus,
programs using these members may encounter difficulties, and the SHRINK
program may destroy the old members.  (Type HELP SHRINK for a description
of SHRINK.)\ ORVYL will be able to access the old members only if their
format is explicitly given.

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION EDIT
.optix EDIT
EDIT\\\\\\\\\\\\is the default for writing (e.g., PUT) sequential data sets.
                Internally, active files are always treated as EDIT format.
                The line number format and position need not be specified with
                the EDIT option.  Library members assume the format of the
                library as the default format.

.* OPTION CARD,PRINT,LRECL
.optix CARD
.optix PRINT
.optix LRECL
CARD|PRINT|LRECL=nnn
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\specifies that the data set has fixed-length blocked records
                (RECFM=FB) with a record length of nnn.  nnn may be an integer
                between 1 and 235 inclusive.  On a PUT, the records may be
                blocked up to a maximum of 6447 characters/block.  If the
                blocking factor is not specified in a PUT, ORVYL chooses an
                optimal blocking factor based on device type.  If the actual
                physical block size is not an integral multiple of nnn on a
                read, any characters remaining after all possible lines of nnn
                characters have been extracted will become a separate record.
                CARD is equivalent to LRECL=80; PRINT is equivalent to
                LRECL=133.  Using these options on a GET command may produce
                some rather odd looking data if the data set being read does
                not actually contain fixed records.

.* OPTION NUMBERED
.optix NUMBERED
NUMBERED\\\\\\\\on a write operation (e.g. PUT), it specifies a fixed-length
                blocked record format and that line numbers are to be saved as
                part of the record in the normal ORVYL line number form; that
                is, nnnnn.nnn with leading blanks inserted as necessary and
                trailing zeroes suppressed.  On a read operation (e.g., GET,
                COPY FROM, EXECUTE FROM) it specifies that the data set is to
                be treated as NUMBERED fixed or variable-length blocked.  For
                non-EDIT format data sets ORVYL uses the line number stored
                in the record and deletes from the record the columns that
                contain the line number.

.* OPTION UNNUMBERED
.optix UNNUMBERED
UNNUMBERED\\\\\\on a write operation (e.g., PUT), it specifies a fixed-length
                blocked record format without line numbers in the record.  On
                a read operation (e.g., GET, COPY FROM, EXECUTE FROM), it
                specifies that the data set is to be treated as UNNUMBERED
                fixed or variable-length blocked.

.* OPTION INTEGER
.optix INTEGER
INTEGER\\\\\\\\\has the same meaning as NUMBERED except that the ORVYL
                line number is multiplied by 1000, placed in an 8-digit field,
                and padded with leading zeroes as necessary (e.g., line number
                1 becomes 00001000).
