.* DESCRIPTION
The SET PERMIT command works on ORVYL files only.  For information on
protecting WYLBUR or OS files, type HELP SET PROTECT.

The SET PERMIT command allows you to specify a number of different ways that
other users may access your ORVYL files.  You may set access privileges
for an individual file or for all files owned by you.  (However, you may
not assign access privileges to individual library members; access granted
applies to your entire library.)\ You may restrict access to another
specified user or group or may use the PUBLIC option to open your file(s)
to all users.

Access permits must be explicitly set.  There are no default privileges
assigned by ORVYL to an individual file or files; however, an ORVYL program,
such as SPIRES, may establish defaults when it creates a file on your behalf.

To give another user access privileges to a single file, give the command:

  SET PERMIT filename FOR gg.uuu [access-level-option]

To give another user access privileges to all your files, give the command:

  SET PERMIT FOR gg.uuu [access-level-option]

To grant access privileges to another group to a single file, give the
command:

  SET PERMIT filename FOR GROUP gg [access-level-option]

To give another group access privileges to all your files, give the command:

  SET PERMIT FOR GROUP gg [access-level-option]

To give all users access to your file, give the command:

  SET PERMIT filename FOR PUBLIC [access-level-option]

To give all users access privileges to all your files, give the command:

  SET PERMIT FOR PUBLIC [access-level-option]

.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION FILENAME
.optix filename
filename\\\\\\\\the name of the file to which the SET PERMIT command is
                applied.  If you do not specify a filename, the command
                will apply to all ORVYL files belonging to your account.

.* OPTION account-options
.optix account-options
account-options\specify a data set belonging to an account other than the
                logged-on user. One form of this option is ACCOUNT gg.uuu.
                Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a description of the account
                options.

.* OPTION FOR account,PUBLIC
.optix FOR
FOR account, PUBLIC
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\account is the user or users to whom you are assigning
                privileges. This option may be in the form gg.uuu, GROUP gg,
                or USER uuu.

                PUBLIC assigns the specified privileges to the all users.

.* OPTION READ
.optix READ
READ\\\\\\\\\\\\permits reading of the file only.  Does not allow any changes
                to the file.

.* OPTION APPEND
.optix APPEND
APPEND\\\\\\\\\\gives only the privilege of adding records to the end of
                the specified file(s).  By itself, APPEND does not include the
                privilege of reading a file; to allow others to both read a
                file and add records to it, you must specify READ APPEND.

.* OPTION WRITE
.optix WRITE
WRITE\\\\\\\\\\\permits full access, including reading the file, making
                changes to the file, appending records to the file, and
                erasing the file.

.* OPTION EXTEND
.optix EXTEND
EXTEND\\\\\\\\\\permits the specified user to pass on to other users any of
                the file access privileges granted to the specified user.
                Only a file owner or a designated user may extend previously
                assigned privileges.  The file owner always retains the
                ability to extend or deny privileges to others.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\The EXTEND privilege may not be given to a GROUP or to
                PUBLIC.

.* OPTION NONE
.optix NONE
NONE\\\\\\\\\\\\removes all previously assigned access privileges.
