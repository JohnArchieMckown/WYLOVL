ORVYL

ORVYL is a timesharing monitor that supervises interactive programs (other
than WYLBUR).  It provides input and output services and main storage
supervision.  In addition, it allocates CPU time among different users.
Programs such as SPIRES, Prism, Folio, Display and Interactive WATFIV run
under ORVYL.  The CALL command invokes most ORVYL programs.
