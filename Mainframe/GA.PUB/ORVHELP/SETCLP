.* DESCRIPTION
The ORVYL commands GET, PUT, ERASE, SHRINK, and SHOW FILES can only
access an ORVYL file when SET CLP is in effect.  The SET CLP
command makes the file accessible to ORVYL's Command Language
Processor (CLP).   SET CLP is the default when a file is first
created.  Only the file owner may issue the SET CLP command.

See the SET NOCLP command for restricting command access to an ORVYL
file.
