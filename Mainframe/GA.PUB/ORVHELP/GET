.* SELECT 'GET Command Options'
.us Option Descriptions

.* OPTION FILENAME
.ix filename 'on GET Command'
filename\\\\\\\\is the name of the ORVYL file to be copied to your WYLBUR
                active file.

.* OPTION ACCOUNT-OPTIONS
.optix account-options
account-options\specify a data set belonging to an account other than the
                logged-on user.  One form of this option is ACCOUNT gg.uuu.
                Type HELP ACCOUNT-OPTIONS for a description of the account
                options.

.* OPTION FORMAT-OPTIONS
.ix format-options 'on GET Command'
format-options\\allow the user to specify the desired record length and how
                WYLBUR line numbers are to be treated. Type HELP
                FORMAT-OPTIONS for a description of these options.
                If no format is specified, ORVYL assumes that the file
                is in the format in which it was last written.

.* OPTION SKIP
.optix SKIP
SKIP=n\\\\\\\\\\skips the first "n" lines of the specified ORVYL file when
                copying it to the WYLBUR active file.  The remaining ORVYL
                file is copied into the active file.

.* OPTION MERGE
.optix MERGE
MERGE\\\\\\\\\\\merges the ORVYL file contents with the contents of the WYLBUR
                active file.  Lines are merged by line number.  The MERGE
                option does not replace lines already in the active file.

.* OPTION RENUMBER
.optix RENUMBER
RENUMBER\\\\\\\\renumbers the lines of the ORVYL file so that the numbers
                are consecutive.  This option is useful when you have PUT
                an ORVYL file with an APPEND option.  (Type HELP PUT for a
                description of the PUT command.)\ The next time you issue
                a GET command for that file, you have to specify RENUMBER
                or you will NOT get the complete file and the system will
                issue the following message:  COMMAND DOES NOT REPLACE.

.* OPTION CLEAR,CLR
.optix CLEAR
CLEAR\\\\\\\\\\\deletes the current contents of the WYLBUR active file before
                copying the contents of the ORVYL file to the active file.
                This option does not warn you before clearing the active
                file.
