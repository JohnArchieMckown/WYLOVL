.* DESCRIPTION
The DUMP command allows you to put the response from any ORVYL SHOW command
into your active file.  For example, DUMP FILES (instead of SHOW FILES) places
all your filenames at the end of your active file.  ORVYL always places the
response to a DUMP command at the end of your active file.
