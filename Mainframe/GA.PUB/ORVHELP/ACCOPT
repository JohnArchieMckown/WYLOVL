The account-options allow you to access information associated with an account
other than that of the logged-on user.  To specify such an account, add the
option ACCOUNT gg.uuu to your command  (e.g., USE DATA ACCOUNT NR.CAR).  If
the account has the same group code as your account, USER uuu is an
alternative.  Similarly, if the user code is the same, you may specify GROUP
gg instead.  You may also specify both USER and GROUP instead of ACCOUNT, if
you prefer.  Use the PUBLIC option to access data sets maintained by ITS and
available to all users.

To SAVE, CATALOG, or SCRATCH a data set on another account, you do have to
supply the password.  To USE or COPY...FROM data sets stored under another
account, you do not need to supply the password if the default security status

is in effect.  See the Batch Processing manual for a description of data set
security.

To specify that the data set belongs to another account, you can indicate the
account options on the command (as described above) or you can give the
fully-qualified dsname, for example:

     USE CHAP2 ACCOUNT E1.DEF CLEAR
     USE WYL.E1.DEF.CHAP2 CLEAR

WYLBUR uses the SET JOB options of the account you specify, unless they are
overridden by your SET JES or other options.  Note that the account options
are NOT valid on the PRINT command; it is impossible to PRINT on another
account.
