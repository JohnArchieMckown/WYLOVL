.* DESCRIPTION
The SET FILEMASK command restricts access to an individual ORVYL file.  It
affects all accounts that have access to the file, including the file owner,
and overrides any other file access permits.  Only the file owner may issue
the SET FILEMASK command; it may not be extended to others.

When a file is initially created, the default FILEMASK is WRITE.

filename\\\\\\\\the name of the ORVYL file to which the SET FILEMASK command
                is applied.

.* OPTION READ

.* OPTION APPEND

APPEND\\\\\\\\\\restricts access to the file to appending records to the end

                privilege, including the ability to read, change, append
                records to, and erase the file.

.* OPTION NONE
.optix NONE
NONE\\\\\\\\\\\\restricts all access to the file.  As with the other options,
                this includes the file owner.  The file owner may remove this
                restriction with a subsequent SET FILEMASK command.
