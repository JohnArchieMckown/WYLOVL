.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW CORE command displays the contents of the specified core location.
If no location is specified, a summary of the user's program area utilization
is displayed.  If no program is currently loaded, the message NO PROGRAM IN
CORE is issued.  The MATCH option instructs ORVYL to search for a hexadecimal
expression or string over the range from the starting address to an ending
address.  The REPEAT option causes it to go to the next occurrence
of the match value.
