.* DESCRIPTION
The SET SPIFILE command blocks read access to an ORVYL file by any non-SPIRES
ORVYL programs.  A file with SPIFILE set may not be accessed by any program
other than the public SPIRES programs or by any user other than the file
owner.  Access is not allowed either for batch SPIRES, batch FASTBILD, or test
versions of SPIRES programs.

The SHOW SPIFILE command displays the SPIFILE access for a designated ORVYL
file.  SET NOSPIFIL reverses the effect of the SET SPIFILE command.
