.* DESCRIPTION
This file describes ORVYL file names.  Type HELP DSNAME for information on
WYLBUR and OS file names.

All ORVYL files must have a filename of the form:

     ORV.gg.uuu.name  -or-  ORV.gg.uuu.name#member|(member)

gg.uuu\\\\\\\\\\\is the owner account.  gg is the two-character group code
                 and uuu is the three-character user code.

name\\\\\\\\\\\\\is the name by which you refer to the file.  This name may
                 contain up to 33 characters, including alphanumeric
                 characters, asterisks (*), underscores (_), and
                 periods (.).

member\\\\\\\\\\\is the name of a library member.


ORVYL automatically appends the ORV.gg.uuu.\to the file name you specify on
commands like GET and PUT.  By default, ORVYL appends the account of the
logged-on user for the gg.uuu.

The fully qualified filename is ORV.gg.uuu.filename[#member|(member)]
The filename may also be expressed as:
