.* DESCRIPTION
The SET NOSPIFIL command permits ORVYL files to be accessed by ORVYL programs
other than SPIRES.  It reverses the effect of the SET SPIFILE command.
(Because ORVYL commands can only be 8 characters long, this command is spelled
NOSPIFIL instead of NOSPIFILE.)\

The SHOW SPIFILE command displays the SPIFILE status of an ORVYL file.
