.* DESCRIPTION
The SET MONITOR command may be used to selectively cause a session break upon
execution of a MONITOR CALL instruction.

SET MONITOR cancels any previous SET MONITOR command.  The SET MONITOR command
is aborted if the user program already employs the MONITOR exit feature.  The
CLEAR MONITOR command disables program monitoring.  Any MONITOR CALL
instruction executes as a NOP following a CLEAR MONITOR command.  The SHOW
MONITOR command displays the SET MONITOR command setting currently in effect,
if any.
