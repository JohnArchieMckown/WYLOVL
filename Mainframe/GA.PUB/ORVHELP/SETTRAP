.* DESCRIPTION
You may cause a session break at a predetermined point in program execution by
setting a program trap.  The session break occurs after the instruction
located at the trap address is executed.

When you set a program trap, ORVYL assigns the trap an index number.  This
index is displayed and must be used to later reference the trap.  The SHOW
TRAPS command displays the location of all traps currently in effect, in order
by index number.  See the CLEAR TRAP commmand for information on removing the
SET TRAP command.

Note:  ORVYL does not permit program traps to be set on an SVC instruction, on
any location other than on a halfword boundary, or on a location already
specified as a trap.
