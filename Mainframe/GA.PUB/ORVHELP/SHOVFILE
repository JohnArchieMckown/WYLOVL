.* DESCRIPTION
The SHOW VFILES command provides information about ORVYL files (data sets)
that are currently attached by users.  Without any options, it produces a list
of each currently attached file by every logged-on user, which can be quite
long.  It is especially useful when you want to find out if a particular file
that you need exclusive access to is attached by anyone else, in which case
you may want to use the LIKE option to limit the display to that particular
file.

The format of the response is:

\\\\\Line <nnnn> <gg.uuu> Fid <f> File <ORV.gg.uuu.filename> <status>

where "<nnnn>" is the Milten line number of the logged-on user, "<gg.uuu>" is
the user's account number, "<f>" is the file system id, "<ORV.gg.uuu.filename>"
is the name of the ORVYL file, and <status>" is either "(attached shared)",
"(attached exclusive, n users waiting)", or (waiting exclusive attach)
depending on how the file is attached.

Type any options you would like to get information about.
SHOW VFILES Command Options (<RETURN>=everything)

?               displays a short help display to remind someone familiar
                with the command of the parameters.

line-number     displays the list of ORVYL files currently attached by the
                user with the specfied Milten line number.

LIKE filename   displays the list of lines that currently have the named file
                attached.  This should be specified in the fully-qualified
                form, i.e., "ORV.gg.uuu.filename".  The compare to attach files
                is for the length of the string typed in the command.  So all
                files with the same beginning nodes can be displayed with one
                command.  Example:  SHOW VFILES LIKE ORV.AM.SUF.SUF might give
                a display like:  Ln 157 HF.C23 Fid 4 File ORV.AM.SUF.SUFIN.REC2
                (attached share) Ln 965 HQ.PRM Fid 4 File ORV.AM.SUF.SUFING.CKPT
                (attached share)

NODISP         Displays counts only.  No files are displayed.

RESERVED       Displays only files that are attached exclusive or reserved
               exclusive and which there are users waiting to attach or reserve.

COUNTS         Includes comprehensive atach couts with the display.

WAIT           Includes all users waiting to attac or reserve in the display.

USER uuu       displays all files with the user node of uuu.   All groups are
               displayed.  If a list of files for a group gg or account gg.uuu
               is wanted, use the like option, truncating the file name at these
               nodes.

FID nn         includes only files for the file system id nn.  The file system
               id can be determned by the SHOW VBLOCKS command.  Count down to the
               file system in the display starting from zero.
