.* DESCRIPTION
The SET EVENT command causes a session break whenever specified program events
occur in the user program.  All program events to be recorded must be
specified with a single SET EVENT command.

SET EVENT with no options cancels the effect of any previous SET EVENT
command.  A SET EVENT command is aborted if the user program has already
established a program event control block.  The CLEAR EVENT command disables
program event recording.  The SHOW EVENT command displays the SET EVENT
command currently in effect, if any.
