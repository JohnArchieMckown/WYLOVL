.* DESCRIPTION
The CREATE command writes a file directory entry in the ORVYL file
system.  The CREATE command with a filename and no other options
creates a file with no contents in the ORVYL file directory.

The FROM filename2 option on the CREATE command puts a copy of the
second file's contents into the new file being created.

The CREATE command can create library format files, library members,
or sequential files.

                any existing contents in filename1 with an empty file.
