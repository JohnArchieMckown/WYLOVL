to convert execs, one must:
  1. declare s0-s9, n0-n9, w0-w9
  2. check for n0 for non-integer arithmetic
     (in specific, look for integer divides, use INT
      function if needed.)
  3. change escape sequences.  can be done automatically
     (eg.  ch '&n0' to '&(n0)' in all nolist)
  4. change $gotos if any, fix all labels
  5. fix any exec <lineno> to be goto's
  6. fix clear exec to be xreturns.
  7. rewrite any other exec from calls
  8. change end commands to 'putend' commands
  9. change all thens to be begin/end blocks
 10. xscan or xformat for final check

a 500-600 line exec took 2 hours + 2 hours for test + 4 hours
for clean-up (ie. add error handling, fix awkward logic,, etc)

a poorly structured, spaghetti logic exec, that is not well
understood may take 4-10 times the above, which is the equivalent
to rewriting the exec, which in essence is what one will do.
